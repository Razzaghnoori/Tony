                    Background        Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular pathogens that        infect a variety of host organisms and exhibit individual        tissue tropisms within a host species The availability of        complete genomic sequences for different species has        provided a contemporary impetus for research to uncover        specific relationships of chlamydial genes with the disease        process an impetus that is particularly welcome because        the fastidious growth requirements of the organism have        made it relatively intractable to experimentation A number        of analyses dealing with the comparative genomics of the        chlamydiae have appeared in the recent literature                   Chlamydiae all progress through a life cycle that is        intimately tied to success as a pathogen The host is        invaded by elementary bodies EBs which represent the        extracellular infectious stage The newly established EBs        develop into intracellular reticulate bodies RBs that        replicate in anticipation of maturation to EBs which then        lyse the host cell and initiate a new round of pathogen        proliferation Aggressive progress through repetitions of        this cycle characterizes the acute disease process        Distinct changes in cell size chromatin organization        membrane characteristics and metabolic competence        constitute endpoints of a reversible developmental profile        A third metabolic stage called persistence is increasingly        recognized to attend the chronic disease process   The        persistent state can be induced         in vitro in tissue culture in        response to various environmental cues such as nutrient        limitation antibiotic treatment or presence of        interferon IFN    All of the latter may act to        trigger persistence by eliciting a degree of metabolic        starvation   In fact it has been shown   that even        normal blood plasma concentrations of amino acids are        sufficiently limiting to infected cell cultures to promote        the persistent state Cells present in the persistent state        have been detected         in vivo for example in the synovial        membranes of patients with Chlamydiaassociated reactive        arthritis   Chlamydial cells poised in this state of        metabolic latency exist as viable but noncultivable cells        that are abnormally enlarged and which exhibit        distinctive morphological characteristics          One of the most prominent host protective responses to        chlamydial infections has been the production of the        Tcellderived proinflammatory cytokine IFN This        cytokine induces a variety of biochemical changes in host        metabolism apparently designed to thwart the ability of        intracellular parasites to gain access to host resources        Relative sensitivity to IFN varies with         C muridarum and         C psittaci being relatively        resistant compared to         C pneumoniae and the various         C trachomatis serovars The relative        insensitivity         in vivo of         C muridarum compared to human        strains of         C trachomatis is supported by the        results of Cotter         et al   and Perry         et al   Conflicts in the        literature about the sensitivities of         C trachomatis and         C muridarum isolates to        IFNmediated inhibition have been attributed to strain        variation   A well documented effect of IFN has been        its ability to decrease the availability of Ltryptophan in        host cells Other antichlamydial effects involve the        inducible synthesis of nitric oxide and deprivation of iron          Although effective Ltryptophan starvation may        resolve an acute infection a more modulated degree of        starvation for Ltryptophan is thought to be intimately        involved in the phenomenon of persistence   Thus        tryptophan limitation is increasingly recognized as an        important factor in a variety of chronic disease        conditions As initially shown by Byrne         et al    and confirmed by        others    IFN acts by inducing indoleamine        dioxygenase a host enzyme that converts Ltryptophan        to Lformylkynurenine This broadspecificity monomeric        enzyme is different from the nonhomologous tryptophan        dioxygenase in liver   and brain tissues   In        addition IFN is a potent inducer of host        tryptophanyltRNA synthetase   Thus the host not only        decreases the pool of tryptophan available to intracellular        parasites but the remaining tryptophan molecules tend to        be increasingly sequestered by the elevated level of host        tryptophanyltRNA synthetase        The biological relationship of IFN indoleamine        dioxygenase tryptophan limitation and the persistent state        of intracellular parasitism extends beyond chlamydial        parasites as illustrated by consideration of         Toxoplasma gondii   This        unicellular protozoan is a eukaryotic intracellular        parasite that is subject to tryptophan limitation by        exactly the same host mechanism used against the        chlamydiae The result is a generally widespread and        asymptomatic state of chronic infection Even extracellular        bacteria such as group B streptococci tryptophan        auxotrophs are inhibited by the IFN mechanism of        tryptophan limitation   In this context it may be no        accident that pathogens such as         Enterococcus faecalis Haemophilus        ducreyi Clostridium difficile and         Cl perfringens are conspicuous        tryptophan auxotrophs that maintain full competence for        phenylalanine and tyrosine biosynthesis The broad        biological impact of host tryptophan catabolism is further        illustrated by the hypothesis that tryptophan catabolism        localized in placental tissue provides a mechanism        suppression of lymphocyte proliferation   to prevent        immune rejection of the mammalian fetus   An        additional example of the farreaching consequences of host        tryptophan catabolism is illustrated by the potential for        persistent immune activation to disrupt the balance between        serotonin and kynurenine production from tryptophan thus        linking the immunological network and neuropsychiatric        consequences of serotonin imbalance                      Results and discussion                  Dynamic gene reorganization and gene flux within          the chlamydial plasticity zones          Figure shows the gene organization in           C psittaci of tryptophanpathway          genes            trp  the large toxin gene           lifA a perforinfamily gene and a          conserved hypothetical gene that is specific to the           C pneumoniaeC psittaci lineage           lifA the           trp genes the perforinencoding          gene and a few other genes can be generally recognized as          interspecies residents of a plasticity zone located          near the terminus of replication   As Read           et al   pointed out dynamic          events of gene shuffling gene insertion and gene loss          are apparent within this plasticity zone They discussed          the lack of variation in GC content and the absence of          evidence for gene transfer as well as the variation of          tryptophanpathway genes          Substantial variation is also striking with respect to                    lifA C psittaci possesses a          single copy of           lifA C muridarum has three          paralog copies           C trachomatis has a single          pseudogene with frameshift mutations and           C pneumoniae lacks           lifA altogether           lifA lymphocyte inhibitory factor          encodes a large toxin that can block production of IFN          It therefore undermines the hosts ability to deplete          tryptophan through induction of indoleamine dioxygenase           lifA is of limited phylogenetic          distribution being present elsewhere only in          enteropathogenic strains of           Escherichia coli   The effect          of IFN is dosedependent    and different          concentration ranges have been shown   to allow rapid          progress through the acute infection cycle low IFN          concentration to promote a stable state of persistence          medium IFN concentration or to completely resolve          the infection high IFN concentration Thus to the          extent that           lifA is considered to be a factor           C muridarum presumably has a          maximal capability to block induction of IFN whereas           C psittaci has only a partial          ability to block IFN induction via           lifA The aminoterminal portion of                    lifA which includes the remnant of                    lifA remaining in           C trachomatis  is homologous to          the gene encoding a clostridial toxin and Belland           et al   have recently          demonstrated cytotoxic activities in           C muridarum and           C trachomatis D that are          indistinguishable from those mediated by clostridial          toxin B Cytotoxicity was dose dependent with respect to           lifA copy number Belland           et al   note that if the          chlamydial cytotoxin inhibits lymphocyte activation as          does LifA in           E coli  it would provide a          mechanism for immune evasion          Within the plasticity zone shown in Figure            C psittaci has an operon          arrangement of genes encoding a nearly complete pathway          of tryptophan biosynthesis In contrast the plasticity          zone of           C trachomatis has only two          structural genes of tryptophan biosynthesis            trpEb and           trpEa  and           C muridarum has no          tryptophanpathway genes at all   In addition both           C trachomatis and           C muridarum have a           trpC gene outside of the plasticity          zone           C pneumoniae has no          tryptophanpathway genes present anywhere in the          genome                          Novelty of the tryptophan operon of C          psittaci          The pathway of tryptophan biosynthesis consists of          five steps and we have used the convention   of          naming the genes in the order of the steps           trpA trpB trpC trpD and           trpE The  and  subunits of           trpA are named           trpAa and           trpAb and the  and  subunits of           trpE are named           trpEa and           trpEb This nomenclature is          logical easy to remember and suited to the modern era of          comparative genomics where gene naming needs to be          consistent and to correspond to proteins at the level of          catalytic domain subunit Thus           trpAaAbBCDEaEb corresponds to the          conventional           E coli designations of           trpEGDFCAB           The tryptophan operon in           C psittaci is incomplete in that          genes encoding the two subunits of anthranilate synthase                     trpAa and           trpAb  are absent These genes are          not present elsewhere in the genome Hence no          biochemical connection with chorismate as a beginning          substrate for tryptophan biosynthesis is apparent Figure           The tryptophan operon of           C psittaci exhibits further          striking aspects of novelty Not only does it contain          genes            kynU and           kprS  that are not components of          the classical tryptophan operon but these genes are not          even present in other chlamydiae           kynU encoding kynureninase and           kprS alternative name           prsA  encoding PRPP synthase are          located at the  end of the           C psittaci trp operon see Figure           These genes together with           trpB trpD trpC trpEb and           trpEa comprise a compact operon in          which all but one gene overlaps its neighbor in the          operon translational coupling A regulatory gene the           trpR repressor precedes the          tryptophan operon on the aminoterminal side A second          paralog of the tryptophan synthase  subunit            trpEb  is also present in an          extraoperonic location several genes upstream of           trpR The possible functional          significance of this paralog as serine deaminase has been          discussed elsewhere                            Hostparasite metabolic mosaic for tryptophan          cycling          A rationale for inclusion of           kprS and           kynU in the           C psittaci tryptophan operon can          be visualized from an examination of Figure  The          ability of           C psittaci to synthesize          Ltryptophan requires an alternative source of          anthranilate other than chorismate as           C psittaci lacks anthranilate          synthase Kynurenine intercepted from the host stream of          catabolism would satisfy this requirement given the          presence of KynU PRPP input is required for the          TrpBcatalyzed step and thus it was necessary for           C psittaci to recruit PRPP          synthase            kprS  to the operon The import of          ATP substrate for PRPP synthase from the host is also          probably needed and the presence of ATP translocases in          chlamydial genomes has been documented              Alternative sources of ATP for example utilization of          PEP by pyruvate kinase are not altogether ruled out            Finally serine import is required for the          tryptophan synthase step as chlamydiae are not competent          for serine biosynthesis          Figure illustrates the mammalian kynurenine pathway          of tryptophan catabolism which is prominent in liver and          kidney The initial step is rate limiting and is          catalyzed by either of two enzymes indoleamine          dioxygenase or tryptophan dioxygenase The latter          is the true catabolic entity has narrow specificity for          tryptophan and is inducible in the presence of          tryptophan glucocorticoids and heme cofactor   In          contrast indoleamine dioxygenase has broad substrate          specificity and is capable of depleting lowtonormal          concentrations of tryptophan if induced by IFN The          overall host metabolism of tryptophan shown in Figure          reflects a general potential that is not necessarily          realized in all cell types The ultimate catabolic          process to generate acetylCoA is a feature of liver and          kidney organ systems Aminocarboxymuconate          semialdehyde can be considered to be a branchpoint          metabolite that either enters committed catabolism to          acetylCoA or that enters biosynthesis to NAD NADP           In the central nervous system a number of          kynureninepathway metabolites are neuroactive and appear          to be involved in inflammatory neurological diseases            Quinolinate can cause excitotoxic neuronal death          Kynurenic acid derived from kynurenine by          transamination can antagonize the effect of quinolinate          Hydroxykynurenine and hydroxyanthranilate have been          shown to cause apoptotic or necrotic neuronal death in          cell cultures   In glioblastoma cells and          apparently in human fibroblasts kynurenine is an          endpoint of tryptophan catabolism   In human          macrophages kynurenine is further metabolized            Indoleamine dioxygenase is a ratelimiting step of          tryptophan catabolism and other steps are not known to          be induced by IFN Hydroxykynurenine is a prominent          metabolite in the eye lens it absorbs UV radiation and          probably supports eye pigmentation in the irisciliary          body            Hence in some host tissue types kynurenine is a          largely deadend product of tryptophan catabolism          whereas it has a variety of metabolic fates in other          tissues In either case kynurenine generally exhibits a          conspicuous pool size   Thus although           C psittaci apparently cannot          utilize chorismate for which it has an intact          biosynthetic pathway as a precursor of Ltryptophan it          has the potential to synthesize its own supply of          Ltryptophan from hostgenerated kynurenine ATP and          Lserine          It is of interest that the conversion of kynurenine to          anthranilate and the conversion of hydroxykynurenine to          hydroxyathranilate are similar hydrolytic reactions          The host enzyme catalyzing the latter reaction is in          fact a kynureninase which is a homolog of the           C psittaci KynU Kynureninases          have been reported to possess a range of substrate          specificities that vary between very high specificity for          kynurenine and very high specificity for          hydroxykynurenine The kynureninase of rat and human          liver has an orderofmagnitude preference for          hydroxykynurenine   in contrast to a microbial          kynureninase that exhibits a very high preference for          kynurenine   It seems likely that the           C psittaci KynU is specific for          kynurenine whereas the mammalian host may possess          isozymes of different substrate specificity in different          tissues          An intriguing possible layer of additional complexity          involves a competitive relationship between indoleamine          dioxygenase and nitric oxide NO synthase type II          isoform which are both induced by IFN In murine          macrophages induction of NO synthase requires at least          one additional stimulus such as bacterial          lipopolysaccharide LPS that acts synergistically with          IFN   and references therein Metabolite flow to          NAD is proportional to the input availability of          tryptophan in murine macrophages   Under conditions          in which there is induction of both indoleamine          dioxygenase and NO synthase an interplay of potential          crosspathway inhibitions are set in motion as          illustrated in Figure  Nitric oxide inhibits          indoleamine dioxygenase   On the other hand          hydroxyanthranilate inhibits both the expression and          activity of NO synthase   Thus smallmolecule          products of each pathway can be mutually inhibitory          Consider a scenario where           C psittaci has parasitized a host          niche where hydroxyanthranilate is a prominent          metabolite as in human macrophages   The withdrawal          of kynurenine from this flow route might undermine the          levels of hydroxyanthranilate sufficiently to release          the restraints on NO synthase The consequent increase in          nitric oxide production might then tend to limit the          availability of kynurenine as a result of inhibition of          indoleamine dioxygenase Although this might at first          seem an unfavorable outcome for the           C psittaci parasitism a finite          but minimal supply of kynurenine might satisfy the highly          limited metabolic demands of the persistent state                          Did the C psittaci trpoperon originate by lateral          gene transfer          The tryptophan operon of           C psittaci is probably derived          from ancestral chlamydial genes before modern events of          gene reduction occurred However as the presentday           C psittaci operon is unique among          chlamydiae it is also possible that           trp genes were lost and then          reacquired by lateral gene transfer LGT As this would          have happened recently after divergence of           C psittaci from other chlamydial          lineages one might then expect the genes to have GC          contents different from that of the overall           C psittaci genome  Table          shows that each operon gene as well as           trpR and           trpEb are within the range          expected for           C psittaci However the GC          content of the donor genome could have fortuitously been          near that of           C psittaci If so one might          expect that the top hits returned from a BLAST search of          each           C psittaci operon gene would not          include other chlamydial genes and would be dominated by          one organism having an appropriate GC content The          results Table  show that this expectation was not          realized          It is perhaps intriguing that when           C psittaci kynureninase KynU was          used as a query sequence the top hits returned from          BLAST were the KynU orthologs from man and mouse          Accordingly the codon usage for the KynU proteins of           C psittaci and           Homo sapiens left half of Figure           was compared with the genomic codon usage of the          respective organisms right half of Figure  The codon          usage for arginine leucine proline and valine is          distinctive in a comparison of           C psittaci and           H sapiens The profile of codon          usage for these amino acids by           C psittaci KynU clearly matches          the genomic codonusage profile of           C psittaci but not that of           H sapiens Thus there is no          evidence for a recent LGT of           kynU between           C psittaci and           H sapiens                           Deterioration of tryptophanpathway genes in the          chlamydiae          Chlamydial species have generally undergone reductive          evolution that includes an inability to synthesize          tryptophan from chorismate That the process of reductive          evolution is ongoing is suggested by the variability of          remaining remnants and by indications that some of these          remnants are pseudogenes At one extreme           C pneumoniae has lost all          tryptophanpathway genes           C muridarum has only one remnant                     trpC  and           C trachomatis has three remnants                     trpC trpEa and           trpEb  It appears that           C psittaci alone assigns a          functional role to tryptophanpathway genes but it is a          kynureninetotryptophan pathway rather than a          chorismatetotryptophan pathway Thus even           C psittaci is dependent upon host          resources that is kynurenine for tryptophan          Figure shows a sequence comparison of TrpC from           E coli with those from chlamydial          species Critical residues can be assessed with guidance          from Xray crystallography data see legend and          invariant residues seen in multiple alignments Given the          presumed lack of selection for function in           C trachomatis and           C muridarum it would not be          surprising to find evidence of unfavorable mutations          Indeed the mutations H  S            E coli numbering and G  E          in           C trachomatis and           C muridarum but not in           C psittaci probably reflect          unfavorable catalytic alterations see heavy up arrows in          Figure  Two changes in           C psittaci not present in the          other two chlamydial species V  T and S           T are conservative changes that are presumably          tolerated          TrpEa from           C trachomatis has clearly          accumulated deleterious mutations in contrast to the           C psittaci TrpEa Figure           Comparison of these sequences with that of the well          studied TrpEa from           Salmonella typhimurium shows           C trachomatis TrpEa but not           C psittaci TrpEa to have the          following changes at critical residues            S typhimurium numbering G           N G  R FL  R and G  K In          addition the intersubunit signaling residue G has          been changed to A in           C trachomatis C          trachomatis TrpEa has a fourresidue deletion between          R and K that is unique in our comprehensive          alignment of TrpEa Xie           et al   pointed out that the          elongated branch of           C trachomatis TrpEa but not of           C psittaci TrpEa on an unrooted          phylogenetic tree of the TrpEa family was consistent with          a likely pseudogene status for the former The rapid          deterioration of TrpEa is in fact apparent from          differences in TrpEa from various serovars of           C trachomatis   Thus serovar          B lacks TrpEa altogether serovars A and C express          severely truncated TrpEa proteins whereas serovars D and          L express fulllength TrpEa proteins although          undoubtedly inactive          The  subunits of tryptophan synthase in           C psittaci two copies Figure           and           C trachomatis appear to have all          important residues conserved Figure  This includes          conserved catalytic residues and residues that are          important for establishing intersubunit and intrasubunit          salt bridges needed for formation of the  complex of          tryptophan synthase It appears that there has been rapid          deterioration of TrpEa but not of TrpEb This might          suggest that TrpEb is under positive selection for some          functional role other than that of tryptophan synthase          When TrpEb is not complexed with TrpEa it has          substantial activity as serine deaminase Therefore          presentday TrpEb may function in the chlamydiae as          serine deaminase as has been proposed by Xie           et al   for some archaea This          is consistent with the total absence of genes in          chlamydiae known to encode enzymes with serine deaminase          activity These enzymes include FeS serine deaminase          GenBank gi  PLPdependent serine deaminase gi           catabolic threonine deaminase gi  and          biosynthetic threonine deaminase gi           A very recent paper by FehlnerGardiner           et al   affirms experimentally          the predictions made in this paper that TrpEb should be          functional and TrpEa should not be functional          FehlnerGardiner           et al   sequenced TrpEa and          TrpEb from all human serovars of           C trachomatis All of the genital          serovars expressed TrpEa and TrpEb proteins but only          TrpEb had catalytic activity Interestingly the          catalytic indoleutilizing activity of TrpEb required a          fulllength TrpEa It appears that these TrpEa proteins          although lacking their own catalytic activity are still          functional in maintaining the TrpEb activity Even though          most of the ocular serovars also had a potentially          functional TrpEb none of them would presumably utilize          indole           in vivo because of the absence of a          fulllength TrpEa The authors propose that other          bacteria in the microenvironment of genital serovars          might be a source of indole a situation not expected in          the microenvironment of ocular serovars In short the          tissue tropism correlates with ability to convert indole          to Ltryptophan           in vivo This seems a reasonable          possibility although it does not explain why most of the          ocular serovars have maintained a TrpEb that seems to          have resisted reductive evolutionary forces It would be          interesting to know whether the serine deaminase activity          of           C trachomatis TrpEb an activity          other than indole utilization suggested in this paper          requires fulllength TrpEa or not                          Overview of tryptophanpathway variability in          chlamydiae          Shaw           et al   have correlated the          variability in the number of tryptophanpathway enzymes          present in chlamydiae in particular the  subunit of          tryptophan synthase with varied sensitivity to IFN          treatment   and ease of demonstrating the transition          to persistence           in vitro C trachomatis A B and C          readily develop persistent characteristics following          IFN treatment           C pneumoniae also is readily          converted to persistence with IFN treatment            Tryptophan has been reported to be essential for growth          of serovars A B and C but not for growth of           C psittaci or serovars DK and L          of           C trachomatis   Thus           C trachomatis serovars AC but          not serovars DK or LL have been described as          tryptophan auxotrophs   Likewise           C pneumoniae but not           C psittaci has been described as          a tryptophan auxotroph Morrison   has also discussed          the possible relationship of genes present or absent for          tryptophan biosynthesis and the differential          sensitivities of chlamydiae to inhibitory effects of          IFN Shaw           et al   imply that           C trachomatis D L and           C psittaci are competent for          tryptophan biosynthesis unlike           C trachomatis A B C and           C pneumoniae This correlates          nicely with proneness to persistence and the more          demonstrable nutritional requirement for tryptophan in          the latter strains but not the former However from the          current database information available it appears likely          that all chlamydiae even           C psittaci are tryptophan          auxotrophs As the host itself is incapable of tryptophan          biosynthesis the host is not a credible source of any          biosynthetic intermediates It is also noteworthy that          only           C psittaci has PRPP synthase          which is needed for provision of PRPP TrpB step Thus          there seems to be no basis for the conclusion   that          variations in           C trachomatis serovar pathogenesis          can be directly linked to differences in TrpEa and it          therefore seems that the latter differences are          coincidental Differential capabilities for acquisition          of the host resources are unknown variables that might          distinguish different strains   In this context it          seems possible that variation in LifA integrity or copy          number could easily explain variation in IFN          sensitivity and the nutritional requirement for          Ltryptophan           in vitro           Except for           C psittaci we may be seeing          different strains in varied states of reductive evolution          with respect to what remnants of genes for tryptophan          biosynthesis remain           C pneumoniae and           C trachomatis B lack genes          encoding the entire tryptophan pathway           C trachomatis D possesses           trpC trpEa and           trpEb C muridarum possesses only           trpC C trachomatis A and C          possess           trpEa and           trpEb The truncation of           trpEa in           C trachomatis A and C the likely          pseudogene status of           trpEa in serovar D and the absence          of           trpEa altogether in serovar B          indicates an active ongoing process of reductive          evolution                          Chlamydial transport of tryptophan kynurenine and          serine          The chlamydiae are dependent on host cells for a          variety of metabolites that are relevant to the          hostparasite relationships of tryptophan metabolism          These include kynurenine serine ATP and tryptophan          itself Hence the nature and variability for transport          of these compounds should be of considerable          interest          Species of chlamydiae possess one            C psittaci  or two            C muridarum C trachomatis and           C pneumoniae  homologs of genes          encoding the well characterized hydroxyaromatic amino          acid HAAAP permease family   Figure presents an          unrooted radial tree that shows the chlamydial proteins          to comprise a distinct cluster           E coli Mtr highaffinity          tryptophan permease and TnaB lowaffinity tryptophan          permease comprise one distinct group and           E coli TyrP homologs make up          another distinct group The chlamydial sequences are          approximately equidistant from the TyrPMtrTnaB          groupings These chlamydial proteins might be          broadspecificity transporters of tryptophan tyrosine          phenylalanine and perhaps kynurenine as well          When the Na coupled serine symporter SdaC from           E coli was used as a query against          the chlamydial genomes TyrP was the top hit           identity This reflects the membership of SdaC proteins          in the HAAAP family An alternative query the           E coli CycA serinealanineglycine          transporter yielded CT as the top hit only           identity           E coli possesses a Na coupled          serine symporter SttT which is regulated by tryptophan            Although this is but one of at least five          different transporters for serine in           E coli sstT encodes the sole          serinethreonine transporter in           Porphyromonas gingivalis            Species of chlamydiae possess two paralogs of SstT which          were judged to be the most likely genes encoding serine          transport Perhaps one favors serine transport and the          other threonine transport Figure shows an unrooted tree          of SstT proteins                          The tryptophan repressor          The presence of           trpR implies that the tryptophan          operon is under repression control by Ltryptophan and          some experimental evidence does indeed show derepression          under conditions of tryptophan limitation            Starvation for hostderived Ltryptophan which is          initiated by induction of indoleamine dioxygenase by          IFN undoubtedly triggers derepression of the entire          tryptophan operon including the genes encoding PRPP          synthase and kynureninase Kynureninase from           C psittaci is a key linker between          the anthranilateutilizing TrpB enzyme that initiates          tryptophan biosynthesis in the parasite and the host          kynurenine foramidase that generates kynurenine In          effect a hybrid hostparasite cycle is generated in which          a metabolic stream in the host away from tryptophan is          intercepted by a metabolic stream toward tryptophan in           C psittaci           The thoroughly studied repressor protein that          regulates tryptophan biosynthesis in           E coli is of limited phylogenetic          distribution In fact           Xylella fastidiosa C          trachomatis and           C psittaci are the only organisms          outside the enteric lineage known to possess           trpR The GC content of           trpR was examined for evidence of          possible horizontal transfer Table lists the GC content          of           trpR genes compared to the GC          content of the corresponding genomes The           trpR GC content of each organism          corresponded relatively well to the genomic GC content          except for           X fastidiosa where           trpR exhibited a low GC content          more similar to that of the chlamydiae or           H influenzae                           Does C psittacihave a regulon controlled by          trpR          In           E coli the           trp repressor binds upstream of the                    trp operon and upstream at the           mtr transport gene in promoter          regions where CTCG or CTAG are important for binding            The           sstT gene of           E coli is also subject to          repression control by tryptophan and a CTCG upstream          region has been proposed to be an additional target          region for TrpR            As           C psittaci has           trpR it seems quite possible that          the           trp operon           sstT for serine transport and           tyrP for tryptophan transport          might comprise a regulon controlled by the           trpR repressor Indeed CTAG andor          CTCG motifs were found upstream of all these genes in           C psittaci but the presence of          these regions did not exceed random probability          sufficiently to justify any concrete assertions The          further use of a computational approach   to identify          the transcription regulatory pattern was also not          illuminating As chlamydial TrpR proteins are the most          divergent of TrpR proteins the motif pattern for DNA          binding may also be divergent                            Conclusions        Chlamydial parasites appear to respond to host        mechanisms for restriction of tryptophan availability with        a diversity of strategies the exact nature of which we        still know very little One strategy utilized by         C muridarum employs a threecopy        dose of         lifA which could inhibit cytokine        proliferation and decrease IFN production by the host        although at least some IFN has been shown to be produced        in mice infected with         C muridarum   Such a strategy        would seem to be consistent with acute infections which        can be a successful mode of pathogenicity in some        situations such as highdensity rodent populations In the        case of         C muridarum the mechanism does not        necessarily involve blocking the induction of indoleamine        dioxygenase and thereby preventing depletion of host        tryptophan in view of some experimental work with the        MoPnmouse model system The primary effect of the IFN        may not be to cause starvation for tryptophan as        antichlamydial and antiproliferative activities of murine        IFN in mouse cells was not reversible by tryptophan          It has been concluded in other studies as well           that hostmediated tryptophan depletion is not an        important factor in the MoPnmouse model system However a        conflicting conclusion was recently published by Perfettini                et al   that the inhibitory        effect of IFN in mouse cell cultures and genital tracts        seems to be due in part to tryptophan depletion because        inhibition was partially reversed by tryptophan It has        been generally observed that in murine systems indoleamine        dioxygenase has not been induced by IFN under the same        experimental conditions that readily induce synthesis of        the enzyme in human systems However the potential to        induce the dioxygenase in murine systems by IFN exposure        has been demonstrated when nitric oxide production is        blocked   Thus it seems that the key difference        between the mouse and human systems might lie in the        details that dictate the balance between the        crossregulated pathways of tryptophan and arginine        metabolism see Figure  If so in human systems the        balance favors domination by the indoleamine dioxygenase        route whereas in murine systems the nitric oxide route is        favored Many individual factors could influence the        balance including differential sensitivities of NO        synthase to inhibition by hydroxyanthranilate or of        indoleamine dioxygenase to inhibition by nitric oxide In        addition unidentified cytokinemediated mechanisms        undoubtedly await elucidation        In any event for most chlamydiae the successful        implementation of tryptophan depletion by the host is        closely tied to chlamydial responses that result in a        persistent metabolic state and chronic disease It would        appear that chlamydiae have learned to recognize and        exploit tryptophan depletion as an environmental cue that        initiates a distinct chain of remodeling biochemistry that        promotes longterm viability in a latent state        It is difficult to guess whether the ability of         C psittaci to scavenge kynurenine as        a source of tryptophan is a recent innovation in this        lineage or whether it represents an ancient chlamydial        strategy that has been abandoned by other chlamydiae        Perhaps the strategy is linked to the particular tissue        tropism of         C psittaci Because the presence of        the tryptophanpathway enzymes varies so markedly even        between closely related stains one cannot be certain at        this point that the tryptophanrecapture cycle is uniquely        characteristic of         C psittaci It cannot be ruled out        that other strains of         C psittaci might lack the cycle        whereas some strains of         C trachomatis or         C pneumoniae not yet sequenced might        possess it Different overall host metabolism and different        biochemical environments in various tissues undoubtedly        influence the availability of kynurenine as well as other        metabolites such as ATP and serine Hence tissue tropism        must be a crucial factor It would be interesting to know        whether the tryptophanrecapture cycle is capable of        providing abundant tryptophan to the parasite or whether        it might be more subtly geared to provision of barely        adequate tryptophan for parasites established in the        chronicinfection mode
