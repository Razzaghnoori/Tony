 Viktor Chernomyrdin Russian president Boris Yeltsin generally uses political appointments in two ways first to demonstrate that he s still the boss and second to catch people off guard Most recently he picked as his special envoy to Yugoslavia a man known neither for an effective negotiating style nor for foreign policy expertise but rather as a man of strong will few convictions and a tendency to move slowly The Russian prime minister from 1992 until 1998 a Soviet apparatchik before that Viktor Chernomyrdin remains oddly a cipher To his supporters Chernomyrdin is a moderate who kept the Russian political machine steady for an unusually long time To his critics he s a politician who has never had a clear strategy or articulated an unambiguous position His diplomatic experience is limited Chernomyrdin was the co chairman of the Gore Chernomyrdin Commission a biannual meeting that addressed much and solved little aside from keeping Russia s decrepit Mir space station in orbit He also helped Russia out of the hostage crisis that occurred in 1996 when a group of armed Chechens took 1 200 hostages at a hospital in a southern Russian town outside Chechnya Federal troops surrounded the terrorists and hostages and Shamil Basayev the leader of the hostage takers demanded to speak with Yeltsin who was in Halifax Canada with the leaders of the G 7 nations Chernomyrdin got on the phone and in a desperate and fragmented conversation broadcast live on Russian TV negotiated the release of the hostages In exchange he allowed the terrorists to return to Chechnya taking a busload of hostages with them as human shields they were later released The incident was initially viewed as a triumph for Chernomyrdin until the terrorists now Chechen national heroes used the incident to propel themselves to power His critics point out that Chernomyrdin s order to the troops not to storm the hospital ensured the Chechens ultimate victory Of course had Chernomyrdin authorized the attack he would have been blamed for the deaths of innocent civilians So what was Chernomyrdin s position on Chechnya Nobody knows Although he was prime minister during the war in Chechnya which has more than surface similarities to the war in Kosovo It was a war against an ethnic minority seeking greater autonomy a war that Russia could neither win nor negotiate its way out of for two bloody years Chernomyrdin has yet to take a stand on it or on what the republic s relationship ought to be with the Russian federation The agreement that halted the war was negotiated by a presidential appointee who was not a member of the Chernomyrdin government Inside Russia Chernomyrdin is remembered as the man who presided over the country s transition from a period of utter economic and social desperation to one of relative stability On the other hand when Yeltsin fired Chernomyrdin in March 1998 the Russian economy was on the brink of collapse The debate over Chernomyrdin s premiership centers on whether his policies of gradual reform helped postpone the breakdown or whether his chronic inaction led to the stagnation that ultimately destroyed the economy Either way throughout his tenure he avoided making decisions instead deferring to the president and playing different factions within his own government off one another To the West Chernomyrdin is the man who moved Russia closer to the West and forged a friendship with the United States It may be tempting to read in Chernomyrdin s appointment a message from Yeltsin to the United States to the effect that Russia is finally willing to behave as though loans were more important than a nationalist foreign policy But more likely the message was intended for a Yeltsin appointee turned rival Yevgeny Primakov the confrontational pro Serbian prime minister who hopes to capitalize on the Kosovo crisis The night Operation Allied Force began Primakov en route to the United States for loan negotiations turned his plane around in midair losing the money but gaining immense popularity at home For weeks afterward his former aide and current foreign minister issued a pro Serbian anti NATO line and decried claims of anti Albanian atrocities as defamatory Yeltsin s own public statements on the conflict were not all that different but now that Chernomyrdin has arrived on the scene the rhetoric has become noticeably milder In the new envoy s first public statement on Yugoslavia he ruled out the possibility of Russian military involvement Yeltsin s previous appointment of Chernomyrdin in December 1992 was another of Yeltsin s inspired and unexpected moves Before Chernomyrdin joined Yegor Gaidar s reformist government half a year earlier he had had the political profile of an apparatchik which is to say he didn t have one Born to a truck driver s family in the provincial city of Orsk Chernomyrdin worked his way up through party ranks He was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and briefly the minister of the oil and gas industries under Mikhail Gorbachev In 1990 he lost a race for parliament He was mainly known in the Gaidar government for holding no views and taking no actions which meant he could be sold as the least of all evils to all factions in the bitter political crisis of late 1992 As a politician Chernomyrdin may seem awkward and indecisive but as a businessman he is said to be ruthless Chernomyrdin is a member of a unique species of post Soviet businessman the all powerful and extremely wealthy head of a state corporation As the first chairman of of Gazprom the Russian gas utility he presided over the company s issuance of stock His tax returns estimate the worth of the stock he holds at 50 000 but other published reports place his personal wealth at 5 billion His position as the man in charge of the pipeline made him an effective negotiator with post Soviet republics which depend on Russia for natural gas and generally have huge unpaid gas debts Though Russia also exports gas to Yugoslavia this fact seems unlikely to sway Milosevic any more than threats to cut off Serbia s oil and electricity have Chernomyrdin s most notorious trait is his inarticulateness which may stem from an ill suppressed tendency to swear His bizarre pronouncements have been a source of endless joy to Russian political journalists Here is what he had to say for example on the Russian financial crisis last August There was a state The state retained The state began to accumulate Results began to be had Speaking of his tenure as prime minister he claimed If one considers what could have been done and then what we did do over this long time one can conclude that something was done Finally his best known statement which in its eloquent ineloquence seemed to sum up everything about Russian politics was We hoped for the best but it turned out as usual In appointing the bland seemingly slow paced Chernomyrdin as his envoy Boris Yeltsin is probably hoping that Chernomyrdin will somehow pull off a settlement without really seeming to or without raising too many hackles and that his ultimate success will be Primakov s loss But like many of Yeltsin s recent appointments this one has the quality of being surprising without being brilliant Chernomyrdin is not all that qualified to succeed in his new mission and he may not even be motivated to do so He has already announced that he plans to run for president in the year 2000 the law bans Yeltsin from taking part in that election but Primakov is another likely candidate If Chernomyrdin succeeds in convincing Milosevic to accept enough of NATO s demands to guarantee some sort of deal he will go down in domestic political history as the man who sold out Serbia If he s worried about the folks at home what he should probably do is take advantage of his own personal weaknesses and stubbornly and laboriously fail
