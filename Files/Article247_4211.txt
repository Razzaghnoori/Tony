 The Millennium s Most Intriguing People Dear Dad I suspect some readers may be wondering what Kerensky Kafka and Prince Lazar are doing at the Breakfast Table I can only assure them that in our family the breakfast table really is like this OK not always In fact not often But sometimes Your 1 year old grandson was sick and kept us up half the night nothing serious luckily and now he s tearing around the house like usual so if this were a real breakfast table my conversation would not be rising very far above occasional groans grunts and frantic gestures towards the coffee pot This being the case I m not sure how coherently I ll be able to respond to your interesting thoughts about the living presence of history But I ll try So Speaking of the Defenestration of Prague how s that for a conversation opener one of the funniest things about it is that one of the surviving victims who fell on a dung heap not a haystack was subsequently knighted and given the title Freiherr von Hohenfall which translates roughly as Lord Highjump But more seriously you suggest we talk about the Millennium What has interested me as a professional historian about the media s coverage of the subject so far has been how relatively little attention has been paid to the history of the planet between 1000 and 2000 I expected far more in the way of exhibitions TV shows special editions of magazines polls commissioned on who were the most significant figures of the past 1 000 years and so on particularly given the enormous interest in history that is demonstrated by things like the success of the History Channel history as a living presence in the living room All right there were the special issues of the New York Times Magazine But not as much else as I would have thought I suspect one reason is that a thousand years is just too long a period of time There is too much to consider In one sense the second millennium in fact contains nearly everything we think of as history for even if we arbitrarily define history as stopping in 1950 something like 99 9 percent of all available historical source material dates from after the year 1000 I would bet that all the extant written material from all human civilizations for everything before A D 1000 could probably fit on a single DVD disk It is already possible to buy a single CD ROM containing all the written material available from classical Greece and Rome This is the reason why the Times Magazine series never really worked and tended to veer off into interesting digressions at best and postmodern silliness at worst The difficulty of even generalizing about such a long period is probably the same reason we are seeing very few predictions about what life is going to be like in the year 3000 How can we even guess at such a thing Making predictions about the world in 2100 is a very uncertain business as you stressed on Tuesday but it s fun and you have at least a chance of being right and if some of your predictions involve the lengthening of the human life span and you hit the mark there you may even still be around to see how you did on the others But the world in 3000 Even most science fiction is still set within the next couple of centuries Another reason for the lack of attention closer to my own concerns is that Western historians no longer have a simple story to tell about the history of the second millennium a single meta narrative to use our jargon A hundred years ago for most historians and for the general public as well the story of the millennium was the story of the Triumph of the West If you had taken a poll of Americans in 1900 about the most important figures of the millennium I m sure Columbus would have come at or close to the top as an emblematic figure of this triumph But today the picture is much more murky the triumph much more dubious I suppose political correctness has some role in this loss of focus However in my current grumpy and groggy state I m in absolutely no mood to discuss political correctness And anyway more fundamental than political correctness is surely the fact that the West has not exactly distinguished itself in this last century of the millennium Hitler was a child of the West So were Lenin and Stalin The horror of World War I was a Western horror Mao and Pol Pot have a certain claim to being called honorary Westerners given who their teachers were And now the century is coming to an end with the Russian army leveling Grozny as the paper reports this morning Talk to you later Love David
