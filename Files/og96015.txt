FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM ENTITLED SECURITIES CREDIT TRANSACTIONS REVIEW OF REGULATION T CREDIT BY BROKERS AND DEALERS RIN 7100 AB28 i Cost benefit analysis A cost benefit analysis was not required or prepared for the rule ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 Pursuant to section 605 b of the Act the Board certified in the preamble to both the proposed rulemaking 60 Fed Reg 33763 33771 June 29 1995 and the final rulemaking 61 Fed Reg 20386 20389 May 6 1996 that the rule would not have a substantial effect on a significant number of small entities 1 Therefore it was not required to prepare an initial or final regulatory flexibility analysis under sections 603 or 604 of the Act For the same reason section 607 is inapplicable While section 609 likewise is inapplicable the Board s submission to our Office states that in addition to publishing the proposed rule in the Federal Register it took several steps to give small entities the opportunity to participate in the rulemaking Specifically the proposal was distributed to interested parties by the twelve Federal Reserve Banks and by the National Association of Securities Dealers According to a Board official the Board s section 605 b certifications were not provided separately to the Small Business Administration SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy Rather in accordance with the Board s practice publication of the certifications in the Federal Register was treated as providing notice to SBA An SBA official has confirmed that some agencies follow this practice without objection from SBA 1The preamble to the final rule actually states that the rule will not have a substantial adverse effect on a significant number of small broker dealers However we understand from the preamble to the proposed rule and the Board s letter to our Office that the Board intended this statement to constitute a certification under section 605 b that the rule would not have any significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities A Board official confirmed our understanding GAO OGC 96 15 iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded

commenters 60 Fed Reg 43726 The preamble to the final rule evaluated and responded to comments Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U S C 3501 3512 The rule does not impose information collection requirements
