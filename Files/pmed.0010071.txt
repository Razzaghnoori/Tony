                            Last year the European Parliament and Council formed the european and Developing        Countries Clinical Trials Partnership EDCTP The aim of this new funding body which has        a budget of euro million spread over five years is a noble one to fund research        in developing countries particularly in Africa that contributes to the development of        affordable prophylactics and drugs for HIVAIDS tuberculosis and malaria        Unfortunately the organization has not got off to an auspicious start Its executive        director Piero Olliaro was ousted from power at the first EDCTP annual forum at the end        of September There have been rumblings of discontent among grant applicants who say that        the first round of grant assessments was administered poorly And notforprofit        organizations that would like to partner with EDCTP have been left in the dark regarding        whom to speak to at the organization        This omission is significant because partnership is one of the key tenets of the EDCTP        European research agencies are slowly beginning to realize that they need to cooperate with        each other if they are to be competitive with the United States The history of many        European countries is such that Europe has much stronger ties with Africa than does the        United States so it makes political sense for the European Union to fund research that        provides a springboard for European researchers to compete effectively with US        scientists        Crucially the EDCTP was also set up to enable European and African scientists to work        together as equal partners There is increasing recognition that the paternalistic        colonial attitude that pervaded tropical medicine in the past just will not do The EDCTP        hoped to change that by having a Partnership Board that contains equal numbers of African        and European representatives However the EDCTP Assembly which contains a representative        from each of  EU member states but none from African countries has the power to veto the        decisions of the Partnership Board which is supposedly the scientific decisionmaking        authority        Doing clinical trials in Africa is far from easy There are too few adequately resourced        research centers and those that do consistently perform well are oversubscribed        Therefore there is a clear need for capacity buildingdevelopment of a research        infrastructure in terms of both equipment and personnel that is capable of coping with        the challenges of clinical trials The EDCTP hopes to contribute to this essential endeavor        by funding clinical trials that are sustainable in the long term In particular it        believes that the best way to train a new generation of African scientists is by teaching        them on the job that is involving them fully in the planning and execution of the trial        rather than flying in European experts who leave as soon as the trial is finished        A commitment from European researchers to be engaged for the long term is essential for        the success of these projects In addition partnerships need to be brokered with national        programs in Africa to ensure that the new capacity can be sustained over time The end goal        is to produce centers of excellence that are run by Africans doing internationally        recognized research that conforms to Good Clinical Practice guidelines But this will only        happen if African researchers are treated as equal partners and are allowed to be fully        engaged in the projects that are taking place in their countries        So can the EDCTP work or is it doomed to failure In many ways the organization has a        great deal going for it Although the budget of  million spread over five years is tiny        considering the combined burden of HIVAIDS tuberculosis and malaria it is important to        remember that it is the biggest single European project for clinical trials in Africa In        many ways the EDCTP is a demonstration project if some success can be achieved it is very        likely that additional funds will follow The project is certainly strengthened by the        involvement of Pascoal Mocumbi the former prime minister of Mozambique as High        Representative of the project Mocumbi is highly respected by the globalhealth community        and carries considerable weight with African politicians Mobilization of political will        within Africa will be essential if research capacity is to be sustained for the long        term        On the downside it seems clear to most insiders that the management structure needs to        be radically changed and partnership with other organizations needs to be improved The        EDCTP Assembly met on October  and  to discuss these issues and to elect a new leader        At the time this editorial went to press there was still no public announcement of the        outcome of this meeting In addition the political infighting that pervades European        politics at all levels needs to be controlled or at least managed effectively This might        be a tall order but it is essential if this worthwhile and highprofile project is to        succeed
