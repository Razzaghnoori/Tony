Prudence slate com Queries should not exceed 200 words Please indicate how you wish your letter to be signed preferably including your location Dear Prudence One of my favorite aunts proposed to visit the White House along with two young nieces when they vacation in Washington this spring Ordinarily I wouldn t give this matter further thought but since I ve read so much about scandalous behavior in the Oval Office I think maybe they should skip the White House and spend more time in the Capitol instead Mostly I am concerned that my nieces reputations will suffer when they return home to the inevitable questions from curious friends Please help me White House or no White House Uncle Cautious Dear Unc Oh by all means White House Prudie feels certain that young tourists are safe from the alleged scandalous behavior You do not say how old your nieces are so just a small caveat If they are in the intern age bracket simply advise them that the room off the Oval Office is not on the tour Prudie prophylactically Dear Prudence I couldn t wait to get e mail at my office because I hate returning phone calls Now I find I hate returning e mails What do I do And what s the proper etiquette for an e mail kiss off How long can I keep saying Oh I didn t get it Can you resend Sincerely Anxious in Austin Dear Anxious You have definitely identified a problem for the 90s I don t think an etiquette has yet been formulated for this problem so here are two jerry built options 1 Ignore things you wish to ignore or 2 fluff off troublesome e s with a brief reply Something like in haste or gotta run but I got your message And dare Prudie say this in an online magazine You can always say that your server screwed up sort of the electronic version of the dog ate my homework Prudie briskly Dear Prudence With winter comes a most embarrassing problem incredible static cling Static electricity which not only turns A line skirts into minis but also affects hair and body resulting in hair that stands out unattractively and makes sparks fly whenever my body touches another What can one do Clung to in California Dear Clung Write to Heloise Prudie hasn t the faintest idea how to solve this dilemma However I do remember that a few nights ago at a party a woman confided that her dress was clingy and electric so she wore a light flannel nightgown underneath She went on to say that this approach had the added benefit that should someone ask her to spend the night she would be prepared Prudie statically Dear Prudence My boyfriend wears totally unsexy underwear plain white briefs that are too big for him and bag in the back I ve tried giving him subtle hints like I think boxers are sexy and boxers really turn me on but they just seem to go over his head I even bought him a pair of boxers but he just wears them to sleep in with his yucky briefs underneath What can I do Turned off in Kansas Dear Turned He wears the baggy briefs underneath I offer you two suggestions Since things are going over his head try under his nose Write him a short love note saying it would mean a lot to you if he forgive the pun bagged his lucky underpants and only wore boxers Alas the alternative is to forget it Would you think Prudie salacious if she were to suggest that it s what s inside the briefs or boxers that counts Prudie briefly Dear Prudence In the initial stages of dating it is usual to assume that both parties are probably dating others I prefer to describe my other dates as having plans I also take pains so that the people I date remain clueless about others I may be dating One of the men I am currently seeing has asked me to dinner at a particular restaurant that he s been eager to try I accepted but when I looked up the address I found it was located in the same very small building as the office of another man I am seeing I am on the verge of suggesting another restaurant lest I collide with the other man Should I change the venue Dating in D C Dear Date Prudie thinks it would be wonderful to be seen by another swain and cannot imagine why you would want to pretend to be otherwise dateless in what you describe as the initial stages of dating this new person Prudie strategically A Postscript From Prudie Dear Readers I am honored that my dear Aunt Prudence has entrusted me to continue her service to the lorn of all stripes I feel as though I am stepping into the family business as it were Happily I have no feeling that I am trying to fill her shoes Truth to tell Auntie wears a rather large size Being of a younger generation I may be a little less delicate in my approach but I hope of no less use to you Yours Prudie
