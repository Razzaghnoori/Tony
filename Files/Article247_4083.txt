 The Role of the Black Intellectual Dear Gerald I m enjoying this more than I thought I would though it does remind me why when I quit reviewing books for the Washington Post last year I swore I d review no more Book reviewing bears about the same resemblance to literature as cleaning up after the elephants does to being in the circus except that you re more likely to be useful pushing a broom behind the elephants Who after all really wants to step in elephant dung This question has been implicit in our conversation Just what as we approach the year 2000 is the responsibility of the black intellectual I don t claim to have any answers but I can t help thinking about Chris Rock s routine comparing Jesse Jackson to Martin Luther King and Louis Farrakhan to Malcolm X and his conclusion that while in the 60s we had leaders now we have substitute teachers When I consider the inclusion in Africana of Tupac Shakur and his cohort of the rappers I wonder whether black academia has been hijacked by a crew of thirtysomething know nothings who actually think this stuff is important The truth though is that this fascination by people who really ought to know better with violence and outlaw behavior is a long standing phenomenon Stanley Crouch or was it someone else calls it the romance of the street nigger and he s absolutely right It crosses the color line of course think of Norman Mailer and Jack Henry Abbott But it s a particularly dangerous foolishness for black Americans because it leads us to take seriously thugs like the Black Panthers and to glorify the Kody Scotts and Nathan McCalls we ought to condemn instead What I m really puzzled about this morning is the omission of Pulitzer Prize winning author James Alan McPherson from Africana McPherson was one of my teachers at the University of Iowa in fact I went to the writing program there to study with him I d first encountered his work nearly 20 years before when I was one of perhaps 20 black students at a Quaker high school in Washington His Hue and Cry and later Elbow Room spoke directly to that integrationist experience to the complexities and confusions of inhabiting an environment where say white people valued aspects of black culture like the blues that my own firmly middle class family had long since discarded McPherson grappled with the complexities and contradictions that plague us as black and white Americans in a way that no other writer I know of has done But I looked all through Africana hoping vainly they d spelled his name MacPherson or that there was a list of black Pulitzer Prize winners That last isn t all that unreasonable given the unremittingly cheerful Ebony magazine like achievement accounting of Africana I returned last night to Cornel West s essay on W E B Du Bois and almost threw Africana at my television I didn t the book s too heavy and besides Monday Night Football was on later I ve never met West Perhaps he s a genuinely nice man But so much of his writing is smug and sanctimonious he knows all the answers and if the rest of us would just listen and follow his advice the world would be a better place Much of the essay takes Du Bois to task for his inadequate interpretation of the human condition translation Du Bois didn t fight hard enough for the rights of women homosexuals and other oppressed minorities and doesn t seem to have thought much about writers like Tolstoy or Kafka and his inability to immerse himself fully in the rich cultural currents of black everyday life As near as I can figure that last means W E B Du Bois wasn t black enough The essay s almost nearly 20 pages of small point narrow leaded type West at his insufferable pontificating worst In my last message I observed that West like Gates wants to be Du Bois when he grows up I wonder now if his problem isn t that he realizes he can t be and so to paraphrase Baldwin s famous if apocryphal observation this son must kill his father At one point West quotes Du Bois with no sense of irony to the effect that we must have honest men or we die We must have unselfish far seeing leadership or we fail And that to return to the question I posed earlier is just the problem So called public intellectuals like West bell hooks and yes Henry Louis Gates Jr himself seem to me both dishonest and selfish they re in it for the money and the power as much as out of any sense of obligation or responsibility to the black community I don t know what they unlike say Martin Luther King stand for Either they ve never made it clear like Gates or like West because they stand for so much appealing to and appeasing so many constituencies West after all is a man who s managed the not unenviable feat of sharing stages with Al Sharpton and Michael Lerner though not as far as I know at the same time I m suspicious of giving too much credit to celebrities but maybe Chris Rock is on to something David
