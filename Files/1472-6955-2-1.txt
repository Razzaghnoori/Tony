 Background Significance Except for small unpublished pilot work by Smith N 39 45 this investigation is the first to assess and compare the Galinstan in glass thermometer device in humans A true need exists to compare this mercury substitute thermometer with the mercury device This need is especially critical because these low tech mercury free devices are ideal additions to hazardous materials HAZMAT units emergency and law enforcement vehicles Methods Sample and Setting A convenience sample N 120 of adult in patients in a rural pacific northwest accredited hospital and medical center was obtained Participants were English speaking currently hospitalized men and women who were at least 18 years of age mentally competent and willing to participate Participants had palpable femoral pulses and competent rectums Oral temperature assessments occurred 15 minutes post oral food fluids 38 This was assessed by asking participants when did you last eat or drink anything Data collection took place from August to October 2002 Human Subjects In addition to Oregon Health Science University approval IRB approval was also obtained through the active medical center review board All participants signed informed consent documents prior to data collection A copy of the consent form was given to participants immediately following written consent A copy of all temperature data was handed to participants after their temperatures were assessed General Procedures All temperature measurement devices were assessed for accuracy prior to study use A swirling water bath was used with identified temperature levels and controls consistent with procedures used by previous researchers 23 34 An ASTM mercury in glass thermometer with traceable certification of accuracy against NIST standards was used to assess water bath temperatures All devices used read within 0 2 F at three different temperature settings range between 97 102 F An ambient temperature thermometer with NIST traceable certificate of compliance was also used A count up timer for precise time intervals was employed Instruments Temperatures were simultaneously measured at two oral and four skin sites immediately followed by rectal sites Four each individual sheathed mercury in glass and Galinstan in glass thermometers were used for these temperature measurements Environmental air temperature was recorded All temperature readings were reported in degrees Fahrenheit An equal dwell time of ten minutes was used for each measurement to control time as a factor affecting instruments and sites 21 22 23 46 47 48 Between use thermometers were cleaned as follows 1 Cool soap and water bath with two minute agitation and cold rinse times three 2 Soak in 1 10 mixture of bleach water minimum of 6 hours followed by cool soap and water bath with two minute agitation and cold rinse 49 50 51 The Australian Resuscitation Council has accepted that bleach can be used for cleansing of resuscitation equipment 51 3 Soak in full strength isopropyl alcohol minimum of 12 hours followed by cold water rinse times two 4 Dry on clean dry towel Procedure The principal investigator and a trained research assistant performed all procedures Right and left readings for oral temperature oral axillary temperature axilla groin temperature groin and rectal temperature rectal were taken using sheathed oral skin mercury in glass thermometers and sheathed rectal or oral skin or rectal Galinstan in glass thermometers respectively Participants were instructed beforehand to keep lips closed once oral thermometers were in place Right left device type locations for oral axilla and groin were random Oral readings were simultaneous Galinstan on one side mercury on the other bilateral measures at the location of the sublingual artery pocket of tissue at the base of the tongue just above the sublingual artery 21 52 Axillary readings were simultaneous mercury on one side Galinstan on the other bilateral measures deep into mid axilla apex 10 23 34 53 with client s arms adducted Axillary and groin site thermometers were placed immediately after placement of oral Groin readings were simultaneous Galinstan on one side mercury on the other bilateral at the location of the femoral artery The technique for groin femoral inguinal temperature readings involved gentle slight abduction of the patient s leg location of the femoral pulse placement of the sheathed thermometer on and lateral to the pulse site and slight adducting of the leg to create a seal 23 34 Technique for rectal included two sheathed thermometers one mercury one Galinstan with water soluble lubrication inserted together to a depth of five cms 21 54 55 Once the rectal thermometers were inserted the principal investigator s gloved thumb and forefinger held the top safety grip on the mercury and top 0 5 cm of the 12 7 cm long Galinstan All thermometers began at a reading below 96 F This reading was chosen because the mercury in glass thermometers were not calibrated below 96 F Prior to recording both observers agreed upon all measurement readings Upon completion of temperature assessments the room temperature was assessed and recorded and the patient was returned to a comfortable resting position A carbon copy of temperature readings was given to each participant Results Description of Sample Although 120 individuals participated in this study not all paired readings were possible for all participants because mercury in glass thermometers were calibrated only as low as 96 degrees F When temperature readings fell below this level no evaluation could be recorded and thus paired readings and difference scores were not possible Participants averaged 61 6 years old SD 17 9 and 188 pounds SD 55 3 they were 61 female Eighty five percent self reported as having a White racial heritage Native American was the second most commonly reported racial heritage at 8 3 followed by Hispanic 4 2 Asian 1 7 and Black 8 These percentages are consistent with the racial mix within this rural community More females than males volunteered as research participants see Table 1 Comparing temperature sites For both the mercury in glass and Galinstan in glass thermometers temperature readings by site were as follows R O Skin axilla and groin That is within subject temperature assessments were highest rectally followed by oral and then groin or axillary skin sites This result was as expected 56 57 58 59 To examine same device temperature reading differences across body sites mean difference scores were calculated along with standard deviations see Table 2 Comparing temperature devices See Table 3for a description of within site differences between the two devices As suggested by Bland and Altman 60 to further examine variability of mean temperature differences between devices a box plot diagram was formulated see Figure 1 The question is Do measurements from different devices sufficiently agree and how different are the two methods 60 Thus a scatter plot of devices by site was devised see Figure 2 followed by plots of the difference between devices by site against their means see Figures 3 4 5and 6 According to Bland and Altman 60 this method of plotting differences allows us to investigate any possible relationship between the measurement error and the true value We do not know the true value and the mean of the measurements is the best estimate we have p 308 Further examination of differences included repeatability analyses If differences were normally distributed the expectation was that 95 of all sample means of differences based on this sample would fall within this confidence interval An analysis of the limits of agreement was computed based on the mean and two standard deviations precision of the difference between devices by sites 60 According to Gardner and Altman 61 confidence intervals are a more useful and informative approach than P values because they present a range of values For confidence intervals of difference scores see Table 4 However caution is expressed due to the skewed histograms of difference scores Thus the assumption of Normality may be invalid 60 61 Correlation is a quantification of the linear relationship between variables and does not examine the question of agreement Often used to analyze thermometer reading accuracy correlation is an estimate of how much two variables change in relation to one another Perfect correlation does not mean perfect agreement 62 Altman and Bland 63 identified this as a favorite approach to the comparison of two methods of measurement Therefore correlation statistics were established for the purpose of literature comparisons Furthermore human body within and between site agreement cannot be assumed Thus relationships between and among variables are represented with a correlation table see Table 5 No statistically significant correlations were found between difference scores and mean temperatures at each site That is variability of difference scores was not correlated with lower or higher temperature readings Comparing demographic variables No statistically significant correlations were found for temperature readings and variables such as gender weight random right left placement of devices oral axilla groin and room temperature Race significantly correlated with age and mean temperature readings for each site Age correlated significantly and negatively the higher the age the lower the weight with weight and race non whites tended to be younger as well as oral axillary and rectal mean temperature readings the higher the age the lower the reading Discussion Discussion of site comparisons Contradictions to the one degree Fahrenheit rule Tradition has dictated to lay and professional caregivers the one degree Fahrenheit rule Many remember learning about the one degree Fahrenheit estimated difference rectal site temperatures are about one degree higher than oral which is about one degree higher than axillary sites As noted in Table 1 this estimate rule could not be applied to either device For the mercury in glass device rectal was 0 64 F higher than oral which was 0 39 F higher than groin axillary sites Rectal readings were only about one degree Fahrenheit higher than skin sites not two degrees as the rule would imply Importantly the Galinstan in glass readings also represented site differences that were different from the one degree rule Though rectal site temperature assessments were slightly less than one degree higher than oral 0 91 F above oral skin sites were only about 1 3 F below rectal readings not the expected two degree estimate Discussion of device comparisons When comparing within subject mean differences between the two low tech temperature devices BD mercury and Geratherm Galinstan the smallest differences occurred at the rectal site the largest differences were recorded at skin sites Skin site variability concurs with findings from other studies 10 26 64 Skin temperature sites by their very nature have innate differences even with simultaneous side to side use and identical dwell times Macro and microcirculation fatty layers muscle mass and skin pockets may differ bilaterally Unless the same site and time are measured body temperature gradients become confounding factors 62 As expected simultaneous insertion of both thermometers into the moist and protected rectal cavity created a near identical temperature reading match Prior to data collection thermometers were swirling water bath tested and those with readings greater than 0 2 F from water temperature were eliminated from the study Thus difference scores at or less than this measure can be deemed to be clinically insignificant As noted in Table 2 only axillary readings had a difference mean of greater than 0 2 F and this mean difference was 0 253 F All mean difference scores were less than the described 0 2 C level reported by Fallis and Christiani 65 to be clinically significant Mean difference scores were also less than the 0 36 F deemed clinically insignificant by authors Stephen and Sexton 66 and 0 2 C deemed clinically insignificant by Fulbrook 58 when he compared axillary and pulmonary artery temperature readings All but the axillary mean difference scores were at or below the 0 2 F accepted variability for inclusion of human temperature assessment devices in clinical investigations 23 34 65 67 Variability among mean difference scores was assessed in several ways A box plot showing mean temperature reading differences and variability between mercury in glass and Galinstan in glass devices at four sites was constructed see Figure 1 Standard deviations were identified for difference scores by site Table 3 along with a 95 confidence interval of the mean of difference readings between devices see Table 4 The greatest variability between device readings by site occurred at the two skin sites This greater variability at skin sites corresponds to findings from other researchers 22 53 68 Ninety five percent confidence intervals for the mean of difference readings were smallest at the rectal site and largest at the groin skin site Correlations between the two thermometer types by site were strong and statistically significant The strongest correlations were again as expected at the rectal and oral temperature sites Human body asymmetry must be considered as a possible variable for groin and axilla sites Room temperature was not a significant variable This result is different from the work of other researchers who found that ambient temperatures significantly affected readings at various sites in infants 57 and various temperature levels in adults 52 Discussion of demographic variables With these study participants the fairly insignificant role played by gender differs from the work of Nagy 69 Nichols and Kucha 47 and Gillum 12 In contrast race was a significant variable for this study Non whites were more likely to be younger and have higher temperature readings at each site and with each device Because subjects were all in patients in an acute care hospital setting and the number of non white subjects was small N 18 15 of total no conclusions should be made regarding this finding However the influence of race concurs with other investigations 11 12 race may have a significant influence on body temperatures and needs to be studied further Though the variable of weight was insignificant age remained an important factor for temperature readings both devices at the oral axillary and rectal sites The greater the age the lower the temperature readings This finding is consistent with the work of Frankenfield et al 8 and Howell 10 Conclusions For both mercury and Galinstan glass thermometers rectal readings were higher than oral and oral readings were higher than skin site temperature assessments This finding further verifies similarities between mercury and Galinstan and remains consistent with findings from other studies 1 26 29 30 Mercury in glass fever thermometers are no longer available in many regions of the US and world For this study and with these hospitalised participants the mercury free Galinstan in glass thermometer correlated strongly with the mercury thermometer and may be a practical alternative to mercury filled thermometer products For adults and with careful consideration of site differences and site competence temperature sites to be considered include all investigated sites rectal oral axillary and groin With proper use non invasive non mucus temperature sites may be safe alternatives to more invasive less acceptable sites Limitations of the study include an unblinded convenience sample of hospitalised patients although participants demonstrated a wide range of age weight and temperature readings A further limitation is the small number of non white participants and the greater number by percent of female and older volunteers Implications Further Research Study findings draw attention to needed areas of research for better understanding of the influence of variables such as device site race and age on body temperature assessments Because comparisons of low tech Galinstan in glass and mercury in glass body temperature devices are not well described in the literature it will be essential to replicate this study for comparison of bias and 95 CI of the bias between these two devices by site The recording of temperatures using all four sites over time with a sample of ill and well individuals would add to knowledge of how different variables affect temperature readings The issue of race must be addressed as a potential body temperature variable Furthermore age as identified in this study may be a critically important indicator relative to how healthcare professionals define and treat body temperature alterations The groin temperature site though demonstrating greater mean difference variability and not well studied in adults may be a good alternative to rectal site temperature assessment This conclusion however cannot be made without further investigation Use and study of low tech Galinstan in glass thermometers during biological epidemics would provide additional information regarding the practical application and efficacy of this device during times of extreme international need List of abbreviations Oral temperature site Oral Axillary temperature site Axilla
