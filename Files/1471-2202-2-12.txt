 Background Bone morphogenetic proteins BMPs are secreted signaling molecules of the TGF superfamily that have been implicated in the control of a host of critical developmental phenomena in the central and peripheral nervous systems 1 2 3 BMP 5 one of the more prominently expressed BMPs in the nervous system has been detected in multiple regions of the nervous system throughout development and into adulthood 3 4 5 6 yet its biological activities in the nervous system are not well defined A role for BMP 5 in dorsal forebrain patterning has been proposed based on its expression in the dorsal midline of the developing forebrain and observations that ectopic expression of BMP 5 in the developing neural tube of chicks markedly downregulates ventral markers while maintaining dorsal markers 5 7 Further support for BMP 5 regulation of early forebrain development has been provided by studies of Bmp5 Bmp7 double mutants 6 However reports that BMP 5 in the mouse brain exhibits peak expression levels in the adult striatum and brainstem and that maximal expression in the hippocampus and cerebellum occurs at E18 through PN1 and again in the mature nervous system 3 suggest additional roles for BMP 5 during later stages of neural development and into adulthood BMPs have been divided into subgroups based on structural and evolutionary considerations 8 Although closely related BMPs have been shown to elicit distinct cellular responses 5 9 10 11 12 13 members within a subgroup often display conservation of not only structure but also function 4 5 6 14 BMP 5 belongs to the 60A subgroup of BMPs which also includes BMP 6 Vgr 1 BMP 7 OP 1 BMP 8a OP 2 BMP 8b and Drosophila 60A 3 8 Other members of the 60A subgroup have been shown to modulate neuronal morphogenesis through selective effects on dendrites Thus BMPs 6 7 and 60A stimulate dendritic growth in cultured sympathetic neurons derived from either perinatal or adult ganglia in the absence of effects on cell survival or axonal growth 15 16 17 BMP 7 has also been shown to enhance dendritic growth in hippocampal cortical and spinal motor neurons 18 19 20 Whether BMP 5 similarly promotes dendritic growth has not been previously addressed Since dendrites are the primary site of synapse formation we felt it was important to examine this possibility Moreover since dendritic remodeling occurs throughout the life of the animal such studies could suggest a function for BMP 5 in the adult nervous system In this report we demonstrate that like other members of the 60A subgroup BMP 5 triggers robust dendritic growth in sympathetic neurons in vitro coincident with activation of Smad 1 Noggin and follistatin soluble proteins known to function as physiological antagonists for BMP 7 21 also inhibit the dendrite promoting activity of BMP 5 Furthermore BMP 5 mRNA and protein are detected in intact sympathetic ganglia and neuron glia cocultures respectively consistent with a proposed role for BMP 5 in regulating dendritic growth in sympathetic neurons in vivo Results BMP 5 induces dendritic growth in cultured sympathetic neurons As previously reported 16 sympathetic neurons grown in the absence of serum and glial cells fail to form dendrites Figure 1A however when grown in the presence of BMP 7 these neurons extend multiple dendrites Figure 1B Similarly addition of recombinant human BMP 5 to the culture medium elicits dendritic growth in sympathetic neurons as evidenced by the presence of tapered processes that are immunoreactive for MAP2 Figure 1C Comparative analyses of concentration effect relationships for BMP 7 and BMP 5 Figure 2 indicate EC 50 values for BMP 5 approximately 10 fold higher than those of BMP 7 however maximally effective concentrations of these two growth factors have comparable effects on sympathetic neurons as assessed by the percentage of neurons with dendritic growth the number of dendrites per cell and the total dendritic length per cell Time course studies of dendritic growth in neurons exposed to maximally effective concentrations of BMP 5 and BMP 7 reveal comparable temporal responses as well Figure 3 Both BMP 5 and BMP 7 elicit dendrite formation in 90 100 of the neuronal cell population within 24 to 48 hr Figure 3A The gradual increase in the number of dendrites per cell throughout a 17 day treatment with BMP 5 parallels that observed in sister cultures exposed to BMP 7 during the same period Figure 3B Experiments in which cultured sympathetic neurons were treated simultaneously with maximally effective concentrations of BMP 5 and BMP 7 indicate that the effects of BMP 5 and BMP 7 on dendritic growth are not additive data not shown Treatment of sympathetic neurons with BMP 5 induces phosphorylation of Smad1 In most cell systems that have been examined the primary signal transduction pathway for BMPs involves phosphorylation of Smad 1 22 and recent evidence suggests that this is also true for BMP 7 induced dendritic growth in sympathetic neurons 23 To determine if BMP 5 initiates similar signaling events in sympathetic neurons cultured sympathetic neurons grown in the absence of glial cells were treated with BMP 5 for 30 or 60 min then analyzed by Western blotting using Abs specific for total Smad 1 or for phosphorylated Smad 1 Phosphorylation of Smad 1 is evident within 30 min after exposure to BMP 5 Figure 4A with significantly increased pSmad 1 levels apparent at 60 min In contrast treatment with BMP 5 did not alter levels of total Smad 1 Figure 4B Antagonists of BMP function inhibit BMP 5 induced dendritic growth Recent data suggest that in the developing nervous system signaling by at least BMPs 2 4 and 7 is determined by the spatiotemporal expression patterns of BMPs and their receptors and by relative levels of the soluble BMP antagonists such as follistatin and noggin that directly bind BMPs in the extracellular compartment and prevent functional receptor ligand interaction 1 24 25 26 27 28 The extent to which these factors may regulate BMP 5 signaling is difficult to determine because of the paucity of data regarding either antagonism of BMP 5 signaling by follistatin and noggin or the interaction between known BMP receptors and BMP 5 To address the former question we tested the ability of follistatin and noggin to block the dendrite promoting activity of BMP 5 The latter was evaluated indirectly using a recombinant chimeric protein containing the extracellular domain of the BMP receptor type IA fused to the immunoglobulin Fc domain BMPR IA Fc The chimeric protein containing BMPR IA was chosen because it has been previously reported that this is the predominant BMP receptor type expressed in embryonic and postnatal superior cervical ganglia SCG 29 As indicated in Figure 5 follistatin and noggin significantly inhibit the dendrite promoting activity of BMP 5 in a concentration dependent manner Maximally effective concentrations of noggin 1000 ng ml and follistatin 1000 ng ml reduce BMP 5 induced dendritic growth by 77 and 72 respectively The BMPR IA Fc chimera also significantly inhibited BMP 5 induced dendritic growth Increasing the concentration of any of these antagonists to levels greater than those expressed in Figure 5did not cause greater inhibition of BMP 5 induced dendritic growth data not shown Expression of BMP 5 mRNA and protein in SCG cells If BMP 5 is a physiological regulator of dendritic morphogenesis in sympathetic neurons then its spatiotemporal patterns of expression should be coincident with dendritic growth in this neuronal cell type Potential sources of BMP 5 include neuronal and glial cells within the ganglia To examine this possibility antibody Ab specific for BMP 5 was used to immunostain cocultures of SCG neurons and glial cell that had been cultured for 2 weeks to allow for significant expansion of the glial cell population The specificity of the BMP 5 Ab used in these experiments is indicated by demonstrations that it recognizes purified recombinant BMP 5 but not purified recombinant BMP 6 or BMP 7 in Western blots Figure 6 Moreover the reaction with BMP 5 protein is significantly blocked by preincubation of the BMP 5 Ab with blocking peptide Figure 6 In SCG cultures immunostained with this BMP 5 Ab immunoreactivity is present in most if not all ganglionic glial and neuronal cells Figure 7Aand 7B In glial cells fluorescence is present throughout the cell but excluded from the nucleus in neurons immunoreactivity is evident in both the soma and processes Preincubation of the BMP 5 Ab with specific blocking peptide Figure 7Cand 7D reduced BMP 5 immunoreactivity to levels comparable to those observed in control cultures reacted with the secondary Ab only Figure 7Eand 7F BMP 5 expression in vivo was assessed by RT PCR analyses of SCG harvested from rats of different ages corresponding to various stages of dendritic growth in sympathetic neurons As indicated in Figure 8 BMP 5 mRNA is present in SCG at embryonic day 20 E20 which corresponds to the period of initial extension of primary dendrites and at postnatal days 3 and 7 PN3 and PN7 which corresponds to the period of maximal dendritic growth In contrast BMP 5 mRNA was not detected in adult SCG Discussion BMP 5 is widely expressed in the nervous system throughout development and into adulthood 3 4 5 6 yet the only function described for this growth factor thus far is dorsal patterning of the developing forebrain 5 6 7 Our data suggest that BMP 5 may also regulate later stages of neural development specifically dendritic morphogenesis The most direct support for this hypothesis is the finding that addition of BMP 5 to sympathetic neurons in culture causes these cells to extend multiple dendritic processes These data are consistent with conclusions from previous studies indicating that dendrite promoting activity is restricted to BMPs from the 60A or dpp BMPs 2 and 4 subgroups and is not observed with BMPs from other subgroups such as BMP 3 BMP 13 or dorsalin or with other members of the TGF superfamily such as activin TGF 1 2 or 3 16 17 Functional redundancy between BMPs of the 60A subgroup has been previously reported with respect to other developmental endpoints 6 of which some such as upregulation of cell adhesion molecules 30 may be directly relevant to effects on dendritic growth BMP 6 and BMP 7 as well as dpp subgroup members BMP 2 and BMP 4 have been shown to influence other aspects of sympathetic neuron development such as differentiation of adrenergic sympathetic neurons from neural crest 13 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 and neuropeptide phenotype 39 It will be of interest to determine if BMP 5 also exhibits functional redundancy with respect to these effects Pharmacological studies of BMP 5 indicate that relative to BMP 7 BMP 5 is less potent but equally efficacious in promoting dendritic growth in cultured sympathetic neurons These data together with observations that maximally effective concentrations of BMP 5 and BMP 7 are not additive suggest that the two ligands share aspects of a common signaling pathway It has been shown that phosphorylation of Smad 1 precedes dendritic extension in cultured sympathetic neurons exposed to BMP 7 moreover expression of a dominant negative construct of Smad 1 in cultured sympathetic neurons significantly inhibits BMP 7 induced dendritic growth in these neurons 23 These data suggest that activation of Smad 1 is a necessary component of the signal transduction pathway by which BMP 7 induces dendritic growth In this report we demonstrate that BMP 5 similarly induces Smad 1 phosphorylation in sympathetic neurons as detected by Western blot analyses using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated form of Smad 1 These data suggest conserved mechanisms of signaling within the 60A subgroup The molecular mechanism s of BMP induced dendritic growth downstream of Smad 1 activation are not well characterized Previous studies have demonstrated that transcriptional and translational events are required for dendritic growth in response to BMPs 15 but the gene expression profile responsible for BMP induced dendritic growth has yet to be determined Thus it is not clear if BMP 5 or 7 induces dendritic growth directly or if some other factor made by the cells in response to BMPs is responsible for initiating dendritic growth BMPs activate Smad 1 by binding to type I and type II serine threonine kinase receptors 40 41 Specific receptor subunits shown to bind BMPs include BMP receptor type IA BMPR IA BMPR IB BMR II activin receptor type I ActR I and ActR II 42 43 44 BMP ligands can bind to either type I or type II receptor subunits independently but both receptor types are required for high affinity binding and signaling 40 The finding that the soluble BMPR IA Fc chimera significantly inhibits BMP 5 induced dendritic growth suggests that BMP 5 may be activating the Smad 1 signaling pathway via interactions with BMPR IA Although the physiological relevance of this finding has yet to be confirmed by ligand binding studies using endogenous neuronal BMPR IA these data are consistent with reports that BMPR IA is the predominant BMP receptor type expressed in embryonic and postnatal superior cervical ganglia SCG 29 It is becoming increasingly evident that BMP signaling is regulated not only by the spatiotemporal expression of BMP ligands and receptors but also by relative levels of soluble BMP antagonists which directly bind BMPs and prevent functional receptor ligand interaction 1 24 25 26 27 28 The different BMP antagonists bind to BMPs and other TGF family members with varying degrees of specificity For example follistatin binds both activin and BMP 7 avidly but competes weakly or not at all with the type I receptor for BMP 4 binding 25 45 whereas noggin binds to BMPs 2 and 4 with greater affinity than BMP 7 46 Whether BMP 5 function can be antagonized by noggin or follistatin has not been previously reported but our results suggest that simultaneous addition of either antagonist with BMP 5 significantly inhibits the dendrite promoting activity of BMP 5 in a concentration dependent manner Thus profiling the BMP binding affinities as well as the expression patterns of these BMP antagonists will be critical to understanding the regulation of BMP 5 signaling in the nervous system If BMP 5 is important in regulating dendritic growth in intact ganglia its expression should correlate with periods of dendritic growth in vivo In sympathetic ganglia dendritic growth begins prenatally and maximal expansion of the dendritic arbor occurs during postnatal weeks 1 and 2 47 48 RT PCR analyses of intact SCG indicate that cells of the SCG express BMP 5 transcripts from E20 through P7 Preliminary observations indicate that these BMP 5 transcripts are translated into protein in SCG in vivo as assessed by Western blot analyses using BMP 5 Ab P Lein unpublished observations Earlier studies have demonstrated the expression of BMP 4 transcripts in developing avian sympathetic ganglia 49 suggesting the presence of multiple BMPs in sympathetic ganglia throughout development These data in conjunction with observations that mRNA for BMP type IA and type II receptors are expressed in the developing sympathetic ganglia 29 are consistent with a potential role for BMP 5 in regulating the initiation and rapid expansion of the dendritic arbor in sympathetic ganglia of perinatal animals The cellular distribution of BMP 5 was determined by immunocytochemistry in sympathetic neurons cocultured with ganglionic glial cells Both neurons and glial cells express BMP 5 protein In situ hybridization analyses of BMP 6 and BMP 7 indicate that both cell types also express BMP transcripts P Lein unpublished observations These findings are consistent with previous reports that dendritic growth can be induced in sympathetic neurons in vitro when cultured at high neuronal cell density 50 or in the presence of ganglionic glial cells 51 Dendritic growth continues albeit to a lesser extent into adulthood and dendritic remodeling occurs throughout the animal s life Mature sympathetic neurons cultured from adult animals respond to BMP 7 with enhanced dendritic growth 15 and treatment with BMP 7 enhances recovery in animal models of stroke 52 53 54 55 56 Although BMP 5 mRNA was not detected in adult SCG Western blot analyses indicate that BMP 5 protein is present in adult SCG P Lein unpublished observations presumably derived from nonganglionic sources such as serum or target tissues These observations together with reports that BMP 5 is expressed at significant levels in the adult nervous system 3 suggest a potential role for BMP 5 in modulating dendritic morphology not only during development but also in adult nervous systems Conclusions These data suggest that BMP 5 regulates dendritic growth Addition of BMP 5 to sympathetic neurons in culture triggers significant dendritic growth that is concentration dependent Data from western blot analyses using Ab specific for phosphorylated epitopes of Smad 1 as well as analyses of dendritic growth in cultures exposed to BMP 5 in the presence of a soluble BMPR IA Fc chimeric protein are consistent with a signaling pathway that involves binding to the BMPR IA and activation of Smad 1 BMP 5 signaling may be modulated by noggin and follistatin since these BMP antagonists were observed to inhibit the dendrite promoting activity of BMP 5 Spatiotemporal patterns of BMP 5 expression at the mRNA level as assessed by RT PCR and the protein level as determined by immunocytochemistry correspond to periods of initial dendritic growth and rapid expansion of the dendritic arbor These observations together with previously published reports from other laboratories indicating significant levels of BMP 5 expression in the developing and adult nervous system 3 suggest a potential role for BMP 5 in modulating dendritic morphology not only during development but also in adult nervous systems Materials and Methods Materials Purified

were allowed to proliferate Previous studies have demonstrated that under these culture conditions the non neuronal cells are primarily ganglionic glia 51 Morphological analyses Dendritic growth was assessed in cultures immunostained with monoclonal antibodies mAb previously shown to react selectively with the somatodendritic compartment of cultured sympathetic neurons 16 These mAb s include SMI
