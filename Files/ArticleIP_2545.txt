 Search Me Imagine walking into your local library to look for a book Hoping for a librarian to guide you you are confronted instead by a bewildering array of entrepreneurs each offering to find what you re looking for But none has cataloged the whole library each has cataloged a different part of it each uses a different system and none is terribly satisfactory That is the situation on the Internet today The old fashioned librarian still has an edge over the vast resources and computing power of the Internet in several ways First a library offers more valuable stuff Certainly there is more raw information on the Web than in any library But the kind of stuff people are actually willing to pay for is sadly lacking So long as publishers fear cannibalizing their sales or aren t able to make money maintaining Web sites there will be books and periodicals that are only available offline or online for a fee You can read the Wall Street Journal free at your library but you have to pay to read it on the Web And of course there are for a fee search services like LEXIS NEXIS that allow you to read documents online but for the time being serious research especially for the budgetarily challenged still usually leads to paper Libraries also have a distributed cataloging infrastructure This means that everyone shares a common cataloging system When a new book gets published a single library will do the work to abstract and catalog it then share that work with all the others This effort coordinated by the Online Computer Library Center is assisted by standards for cataloging information The Dewey Decimal System and the Library of Congress are both schemes that help guarantee that a book can be found the same way in different libraries Most important though libraries invite reduced expectations No one expects to walk into a library and get a list of every book that contains the word poker organized by subject title and author We re just happy to look up poker in the online card catalog and find the books that are actually about poker And typically we d be just as happy not to find the references to red hot poker or poker faced Of the many Internet search services Yahoo comes the closest to this card catalog approach It does it the old fashioned way hiring people to look at each site and assign it an abstract and one or more categories This is easy for people to understand but it s not comprehensive Even very diverse sites seldom appear in more than a few categories For instance a search for Slate click here shows it somewhere under the Politics category but not the Movie Reviews or Economics categories Yet Slate runs a movie review every week and has published many articles on economics Even if Yahoo wanted to be this comprehensive the humans cataloging the materials cannot possibly keep up with the ever changing nature of the Web To stay current they would have to read every page of every site every day To solve this problem most other search services use computers instead of humans to do their cataloging Their machines scan every Web page they can find by a process known as crawling see my discussion of crawling in a previous Webhead column and put every word on every page into a giant index One of the first sites to take that approach was Infoseek Click here to search for slate The naive user might expect to see a link to our home page But the problem is that our home page includes few instances of the word slate many fewer than say the home page of a dealer of roofing materials or pool tables is likely to That s the limitation of a system based on text indexing It doesn t really know what a page is about just what words appear on it Using a little artificial intelligence the computer tries to decide which pages are more about a given word than others but it s not always successful HotBot is another search site Try the slate search by clicking here By the way as you try out these searches you may see an advertisement for Slate That means we bought the rights to the word slate Whenever someone searches for it our ad shows up On the Web you can buy words isn t that great Excite s site uses some of that artificial intelligence to help you refine your searches Try searching for slate by clicking here If you find a page that you like you can click on more like this Excite will return a list of pages which look like the page you clicked on That means that similar words appear on the pages with similar frequency Sometimes this works more often it returns pages that seem impressively unrelated For instance this search for pages like the Slate parody Stale yields not only Slate a good guess but also the Steel Lunch Boxes Web page not a good guess but entertaining nonetheless AltaVista s site takes a weirder approach to this idea of refining searches Search for Slate by clicking here Adding or subtracting words from your search criteria can help find what you re looking for For instance adding Kinsley and subtracting roofing would probably increase your chances of finding our home page Their LiveTopics technology attempts to help you do this They look up slate in their index and see that it often occurs on the same page as roof so they suggest this as a possible refinement of the search But since these suggestions are generated by computer they can be very weird To see this in action click on one of the LiveTopics links on the AltaVista search results page How did Adaptec or Skadden get on the list Your guess is as good as mine Well for Skadden it s not such a mystery considering that Slate is part of the name of the D C law firm Skadden Arps Slate Meagher Flom The best solutions for searching will probably result from a combination of humans and computers If AltaVista s list of search refinements was generated by a human for instance it might be more helpful If the producers of every site cataloged it themselves then Yahoo wouldn t have a hard time keeping up with them Of course everyone would have to agree on standard ways to do this and if everyone agreed for profit search sites like Yahoo probably wouldn t be necessary So don t be surprised if the status quo lasts just a little while longer
