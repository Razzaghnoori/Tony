 Tom DeLay s Mental Shutdown If Tom DeLay didn t exist Bill Clinton would have to invent him Last Friday the New York Times reported that the House majority whip had told journalists Republicans would spend next year s anticipated 14 billion budget surplus and had intended to do so all year long to force President Clinton to pay for any additional spending requests out of the Social Security surplus Clinton pounced on DeLay s remarks The Republican leadership has revealed that actually they have a secret strategy to raid the Social Security surplus to pay for a risky economic scheme They say they re spending more money now to force that result Clinton declared I can think of nothing more cynical and irresponsible Welcome to Government Shutdown III In 1995 Clinton and the Republicans refused to compromise on appropriations the government ground to a halt and voters blamed the GOP Last year facing another impasse the Republicans caved and accepted additional spending demanded by Clinton This year DeLay has decided to engineer the showdown so that the GOP will have the upper hand and Clinton will take the blame The plan is magnificently self defeating The party that will lose the showdown is the party that is perceived to have engineered it And DeLay has just handed Clinton all the evidence he needs 1 Strategy According to the Times DeLay referred twice to the GOP s strategy and said it had been in the works all year From the get go the strategy has always been we re going to spend what s left Clinton immediately dubbed this a secret strategy White House Chief of Staff John Podesta repeated that phrase twice on Meet the Press and the press climbed all over it Saturday s Washington Post front page explored the GOP s strategy to deliberately spend the surplus Other publications affirmed that the GOP had been plotting all along On Late Edition Sen George Voinovich R Ohio chided DeLay for setting up a crash with Social Security DeLay failed to grasp that when two parties collide the public will blame the one that doesn t look surprised If you re going to have a secret strategy keep it secret 2 Provocation Having broadcast his strategy DeLay signaled his intention to start the war GOP Picks a Budget Fight announced the Post citing the Republicans deliberate provocations and confrontation strategy Gannett News Service reported that DeLay was daring Clinton Rather than squelch this story DeLay went on television Saturday and when asked whether he was negotiating with Clinton answered There s nobody to negotiate He doesn t negotiate He goes out and does photo ops CNN s Rowland Evans concluded that DeLay certainly is not in a negotiating mood and has presented President Clinton with a fait accompli take it or leave it When Clinton leaves it guess which man the public will blame 3 Force The Times paraphrased DeLay as saying that his plan would force President Clinton to pay for any additional spending requests out of the Social Security surplus Hours after the story appeared Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott held a press conference to brag about the GOP s freshly passed tax cut Instead reporters pressed Lott about DeLay s strategy to force a showdown The Associated Press confirmed that Republicans planned to force Clinton to pay for his spending programs from the Social Security surplus If the plan works Clinton will dip into the trust fund And then with a mountain of press clips to back him up he will repeat what he said Friday The GOP deliberately forced that result 4 Spite We will negotiate with the President after he vetoes the bills on his knees DeLay told the Times We ve got him in the box Pundits smelling blood hyped these quotes on every talk show The Republicans are somehow banking on the idea that Clinton will have to as DeLay said get on his knees and beg observed Juan Williams on Fox News Sunday DeLay has made no secret he would relish such a scenario with Clinton on his knees added the AP Everyone agrees DeLay is determined to beat and humiliate Clinton at any cost And guess who will get the blame for a shutdown The guy who seems determined to beat and humiliate his opponent at any cost 5 Blame According to the Times DeLay indicated that if the spending caps were lifted that was acceptable as long as the American people understand it s the President busting the caps not us CNN s Wolf Blitzer repeated this quote and discussed the charge that Tom DeLay wants the president to go into that Social Security trust fund in order to accuse him of breaking it The Post concluded that GOP lawmakers are betting that the public will blame the president not Congress for squandering the money he has insisted be saved to shore up Social Security The National Republican Congressional Committee even conducted a poll on the subject Republicans end up looking as though they care more about the PR contest than about the fiscal consequences which is the surest way to lose the PR contest Clinton s opening salvo conveyed the words Democrats will use to package DeLay s plan cynical and irresponsible That day a White House spokeswoman told the AP that the Republican budget doesn t meet the responsibility test It s a cynical plan On Fox News Sunday Clinton budget chief Jack Lew assailed the GOP s cynical charade On Meet the Press Podesta attacked the Republican strategy to go into the Social Security surplus in the vain hope that the public will blame the president It s cynical and it s wrong Meanwhile Clinton and Podesta projected pacifism and public spirited diligence I am not nearly as pessimistic as a lot of people are about the prospects of our reaching an agreement and I am determined to try to do it Clinton declared Sunday When asked whether the government would shut down again Podesta replied sadly I hope not That s certainly not in the public s interest On the Republican side Lott and House Majority Leader Dick Armey have been left to clean up DeLay s mess I m not seeking a showdown Lott insisted on This Week as pundits bombarded him with questions about DeLay s plot We re not looking for a battle We re looking for solutions On Fox News Sunday Armey assured Brit Hume We will continue to work with the president On his knees asked Hume No of course not Armey pleaded In the event of another budget impasse Lott explained Republicans would keep funding programs at the current year s level to avoid a train wreck while they negotiate That s the solution he suggested DeLay of course put it differently There s a little trick that you can use called a continuing resolution that continues spending at least year s level And we can keep that up all through next year if we have to he bragged on CNN If he vetoes that the president will have shut down the government Rather than call this plan a solution as Lott did the AP reported that DeLay had conceived it as a little trick that would put Clinton at risk of being blamed for a shutdown You can understand why DeLay keeps boasting of his tricks and strategies He s determined not to lose the shutdown the way he did last time and thanks to his new plan he won t Above all he s determined to prove his critics wrong They said he had no plan They said he was stupid Well he showed them
