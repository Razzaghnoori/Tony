        okay       what would you rather have or you want salary too plus what whats most important to you   well       as far as tangible benefits go i would say that uh health insurance of all forms is probably my next most important concern   right   i feel that a company that can provide good health benefits such as health care dental and vision   umhum   as well as good long term and short term disability plans uh goes a long way toward satisfying my needs   umhum well ill tell you i think that is the most important thing  ive uh im not working right at the moment but the company that i did work for excuse me i had health benefits you know dental vision all that pension plan um now i dont have that although i do have a pension that im drawing from them which thank God i had   right   but uh man i think those medical benefits are the most important uh   you you really dont realize how important they are until you find yourself on the other side of the fence without them and having to cover your own medical and uh you can quickly see where they become a very important part of your of your compensation package   right um i should knock on wood i havent you know had any serious health problems or anything ive only probably been to the doctor a couple of times since i  left work and it was only for a cold you know and they cant really do anything for you anyhow so you might as well not even go   yeah they look at you say well youre still breathing so uh   yeah yeah right  oh youve got a cold go home and take uh liquids and uh rest   yeah   but um that is definitely the most important um pension i guess is next um thank God that i had one i dont know what happened to the salary employees when uh the company went bankrupt but i was union so mine was being put into a like a trust fund you know   right   so but i dont know if they ever got anything or if they lost all of theirs or   i suspect that it just disappeared   yeah thats what i was thinking too i really feel sorry for all those people that spent all that time there you know   right   so where what company do you work for   um i work for a little startup company here in Pittsburgh called Trans Arc um   um umhum   have you heard of them   no   they we do uh distributive system software   umhum umhum   for Unix based workstations   umhum   so   no i i worked for a trucking company P I E nation wide you probably heard of that   ah yes yes fact my mom drives trucks so   oh does she really oh how about that   yes so yeah i see uh after the merger uh you see a lot of Ryder PIE stuff on the road   well you did   so did did Ryder get out of the business is that what happened or   well Ryder and P I E went together you know and then then that ended it   right ah so that the merger pretty much ended the whole thing   it really did its it started i think a little bit before that but that when P I E and and Ryder went together why it was downhill from then on you know   yeah and the the problem with that is you know when you leave a job you can continue your benefits for some finite period of time but when when the company goes bankrupt i mean the theyre just cut off completely and youre responsible for your own   right   and and thats exceedingly expensive   right yes it was over three hundred fifty dollars a month if we wanted to continue our own benefits we could do that for eighteen months   right   but three hundred and fifty dollars a month God thats terrible   its definitely excessive   you know so but anyhow uh and jobs arent that hard to find to get another one that does pay your benefits you know and a lot of them that if you do get a job they dont pay benefits   true yeah theyre starting to to cut back especially startups i know here at Trans Arc we get uh we get health care and thats it and theres no dental or vision   umhum umhum   and the the shortterm disability policy is is a ninety day policy and there is no long term disability policy   um   so you know at least in the case of this particular company they tend to scrimp a little bit there   umhum umhum   and you know of course they can use the excuse well were a startup   yeah right but you know whats happening is the disability plan you know so many people are lying about their things God theres been big articles in the paper about that uh you know they claim a back injury and then someone goes out and spies on them and theyre lifting refrigerators into trucks and and everything else you know   right   so i dont know whats happening and whats going to happen but uh   well that certainly doesnt help matters any i mean you you get people who are willing to put their neck on the line to get you you know these additional benefits such   um
