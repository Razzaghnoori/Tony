 My Son the Mobster Dear Judith Let s get down to brass tacks I wouldn t call what I gave you a butt kicking That was no butt kicking I don t know maybe at Slate that was a butt kicking Second thing what s wrong with Little Herring for a nickname No way I m calling you Da Man on account of the fact that you re a woman that was you in that wedding dress a couple of months ago right Little Herring is a great nickname It recalls the halcyon days of Jewish gangsterdom I know I m on record in Slate in fact condemning the gauzy romantic view of Jewish gangsters perpetrated by certain awful writers But to be fair Jewish gangsters had excellent nicknames Kid Twist Pittsburgh Phil Little Farvel Abbaddaba Better nicknames than the Italians ever had Look you re my friend Would you rather be Big Herring Whatever makes you feel good there s an associate of the Gotti crew named Steven the Jew Kaplan no kidding Would you like to be Judith the Jew Shulevitz I m sure we could talk to Kaplan about letting you share the name Now let me tell you where you re wrong oh how I love writing those words I didn t say that mobsters aren t taking their cues from The Sopranos What I said was that no self respecting mobster would want to be a member of Tony Soprano s sad sack crew Until you produce for me an actual mobster who says otherwise I ll stand by this statement Anyway news reports are simply stating that real life mobsters caught on tape are griping that the writers of The Sopranos are stealing their life stories in other words they accuse the writers of taking their cues from the mob not vice versa Now about you and your Culturebox Listen TV criticism is fine I have no problem with TV criticism Some of my best friends are TV critics You even employed me once as a TV critic talk about a mistake on your part All I m saying is The Sopranos is being buried under a mudslide of over intellectualizing hype and it s suffering for it Which takes me right to the point where I actually agree with you on something The first episode of the new Sopranos is a real drag flat sour and ponderous I almost fell asleep watching it Tony just seems mean and crazy and a bit more bloated than usual don t you think And Livia Good God Evil and not amusing at all It was a terrible mistake to keep her alive for the second season apparently some of the writers wanted to kill her off but everybody on the set loves Nancy Marchand so much they kept her alive and bitching Imagine how clean a break it would have been to open the second season at Livia s funeral 56 6 modem T1 connection Download Windows Media Player The only thing I liked about the first episode is Steven Van Zandt as Silvio Dante imitating Michael and Kay Corleone Alright Van Zandt is one of my heroes and I think his portrayal of a low wattage Soprano soldier is a rip so I m prejudiced but there was a kind of joy in that one scene that is missing from the rest of the episode Oh by the way I think you re giving short shrift to Christopher Tony s nephew and a wannabe made man Yes he s an asshole junkie but in the capable hands of Michael Imperioli he is not only that He is a cursing bitch slapping metaphor for the entire decline of the mob It s all there his terrible work ethic his drug use his obsession with the mob of the distant past the mafia of his fantasies of course he s writing a screenplay and of course he can t spell All that s missing is the steroids out of control steroid use by the mob s young guns is what s killing the mafia as much as anything else Christopher is precisely the sort of mobster who turns government witness at the thought of real jail time I guess I m answering the What happens next question The mafia is over as we know it or think we know it It s losing its command and control structure There will always be localized Italian American gangs but a wide network of criminals who have their hooks into organized labor and adhere to a code of silence That s pretty much over You can blame Rudy Giuliani The Sopranos biggest fan for that Of course writers like me are always saying the mob is dead and we re always too early But the main problems the mob faces are only getting worse One is recruitment The old neighborhoods are breaking up and it s the old neighborhoods that produced the mob farm teams Also no self respecting mobster wants his son to follow in his footsteps I hate to refer to my own work but an article I wrote in the New York Times Magazine last year focused on this very subject John Gotti s fatal flaw as a mobster and as a father was that he had his son follow him into the business No halfway intelligent mobster had any respect for him after that My prediction Hollywood will be making mob movies long after the mob as we know it is gone And that s when Italian Americans will really have something to bitch about by the way where do you stand on the The Sopranos isn t good for Italians question OK enough for now Are we good Or are you still lining up someone from your crew to take a shot at me Jeff
