 Background Opioid receptors belong to the large superfamily of G protein coupled receptors 1 Three major types of opioid receptors and have been cloned and each one is associated with several physiological and behavioural roles The focus of the present work is the opioid receptor Delta opioid receptors play a modulatory role in analgesia hibernation autonomic nervous system function neuroendocrine system function mood driven behaviours and olfaction 2 Thus understanding the requirements for activation of opioid receptors can lead to identification and design of novel drugs acting through this receptor for treatment of various physiological problems While designing drugs with selectivity to a single receptor can be a desirable approach in drug design another approach may be to design drugs that act on more than one receptor but with differential activity on each receptor These would be drugs that act as an agonist at one receptor and as an antagonist or partial agonist at another receptor type The latter approach would be useful in situations where the same receptor type that mediates the beneficial effect of the drug also mediates the untoward effect 3 In this case interaction with another receptor type could reverse the unwanted effects associated with the activation of the first receptor In the absence of comprehensive activation data for opioid ligands at opioid receptors we set out to characterize a set of fifteen opioid ligands for their activity in cells expressing only opioid receptors These ligands were selected based on our previous data showing that they bound all three opioid receptors 4 However model tissue studies 5 and in vivo studies 6 had suggested that these ligands exhibited differential activation profiles at the three opioid receptors Thus the present study was designed 1 to describe the activation profiles of a set of opioid ligands not previously defined at an isolated cell system expressing only opioid receptors and 2 to compare the relative efficacies and potencies of these ligands to the strongest ligand in the set metazocine to the common opioid analgesic morphine and to the endogenous opioid ligand met enkephalin In this study the activity of opioid receptor was measured by assessing the levels of inhibition of forskolin stimulated cAMP production in the presence of various opioid ligands It has been reported that opioid receptors couple more efficiently to adenylyl cyclase system than to Ca 2 channels 7 This evidence supports the use of cAMP system for assessing the activity of these receptors Moreover cAMP has been implicated in playing a role in the analgesic effects mediated through opioid receptors 8 9 Human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing mouse opioid receptors were used to characterize the activation profiles of opioid ligands in this study The results describe the activity of a set of ligands not previously characterized at opioid receptors The results obtained from this study will serve to define the relative efficacies and potencies of a set of opioid ligands compared to one another and differentiate between the full and partial agonists at opioid receptors Results Receptor activation All ligands used Table 1 were non peptide ligands selected for lack of selectivity for different opioid receptors In the majority of cases the data were reproducible and inter experimental variability was small Figure 1 Thus the data from several experiments were normalized to the top of the fitted curve no ligand forskolin alone the results of several experiments pooled and a new fitted curve constructed Figure 2 The IC 50 values in Table 1are the results of the pooled normalized data from 3 or more experiments carried out in duplicate Two ligands nalbuphine and naltrexone were categorized as antagonists All other ligands studied showed a robust inhibitory effect on the forskolin stimulated cAMP production Table 1 The rank order of efficacy of the ligands tested was metazocine xorphanol fentanyl SKF 10047 etorphine hydromorphone butorphanol lofentanil WIN 44 441 Nalbuphine cyclazocine met enkephalin morphine dezocine Statistical analysis showed that most of the agonists tested had efficacies that were not significantly different from that of the endogenous ligand met enkephalin The only exceptions were the highly efficacious ligands fentanyl P 0 05 metazocine P 0 001 and xorphanol p 0 001 The potencies for the different ligands ranged from 0 2 2039 nM The most potent ligands studied as measured by the lowest IC 50 values Table 1 were etorphine cyclazocine lofentanil and xorphanol with IC 50 s of less than 10 nM The other ligands met enkephalin WIN 44 441 hydromorphone and Butorphanol exhibited potencies of 10 100 nM metazocine and SKF 10047 100 200 nM and nalbuphine dezocine and morphine 400 1000 nM The least potent ligand was fentanyl with an IC 50 of about 2 M The rank order of potency of these ligands was etorphine lofentanil cyclazocine xorphanol met enkephalin Win 44 441 hydromorphone butorphanol metazocine SKF 10047 dezocine nalbuphine morphine fentanyl Figure 2depicts dose response curves of a representative set of ligands Etorphine and lofentanil are shown as examples of two very efficacious and highly potent ligands SKF 10047 is representative of a very efficacious ligand with intermediate potency Finally fentanyl is shown as an example of a ligand with very low potency which is nevertheless very efficacious if high enough concentrations are used Receptor binding Human embryonic kidney HEK cells were transfected to express mouse opioid receptors These cells do not express any endogenous opioid receptors as they lack binding of the radioactive tracer 3H DPDPE data not shown thus they serve as a good system for the expression of opioid receptors A single clone of HEK cells stably expressing 1925 425 fmole mg protein opioid receptors was selected for this study The K d for 3H DPDPE in these cells was 0 65 0 27 nM These cells were used to characterize the activity of fifteen opioid ligands in inhibiting forskolin stimulated cAMP production Ligands that showed very low potencies or low enough efficacies to be tested for antagonistic effect were further characterized for their binding affinities at opioid receptors All ligands studied exhibited K i values in nanomolar range The rank order of affinity of the ligands was xorphanol Win 44 441 nalorphine morphine nalbuphine fentanyl Table 2 The rank order of affinity agrees with the rank order of potency of these ligands in inhibiting forskolin stimulated cAMP production Discussion Ligands acting at receptors can induce antinociception both spinally and supraspinally 10 11 12 thus identifying ligands that activate opioid receptors and determining their physiochemical characteristics is essential to understanding opioid receptor pharmacology and physiology There is evidence suggesting that selective opioid ligands do not cause changes in respiratory parameters 13 Thus suggesting that designing specific ligands that act at opioid receptors may be useful in formulating analgesics without the side effect of ventilatory depression Yet some selective ligands have been shown to be ineffective antinociceptive agents when given systemically 14 15 16 The reason for this ineffectiveness is not clear Still other reports have suggested that opioid ligands with agonistic effect at opioid receptors and antagonistic effect at opioid receptors are potentially useful analgesics 3 17 18 These latter results advocate that the key to designing opioid ligands with optimal analgesia and minimal side effects may be in the design of ligands that act on more than one receptor type but activate each receptor differently Thus it is useful to identify opioid ligands with differential activation profiles and characterize their physiological effects analgesic and unwanted effects Prior to the design of any novel drugs based on this approach it is necessary to clearly understand how the known nonselective opioid ligands act at opioid receptors Such information can not only help explain some of the paradoxical behavioural data of these ligands but it can also explain the interaction of each ligand with a single receptor involved in modulation of the pain pathways The present data serve to define the mode of action of a set of opioid ligands at opioid receptors and will help explain the physiological effect of these ligands Moreover since opioid receptors have been reported to exert a physiology indicative of regulatory effects on hemodynamic balance and cardiac function as well as hibernation a better understanding of receptor pharmacology can lead to possible novel uses of ligands independent of analgesia The present study was designed as one of the steps in defining the detailed pharmacology of a set of non selective opioid ligands and aimed at defining the activation profiles of these ligands at a well defined system expressing only opioid receptors The use of such a system is essential for understanding the mode of action of ligands at a specific receptor Such data can then be used to interpret the findings from more complex settings such as in vivo studies where multiple opioid receptor types are expressed The data presented in this report agree with available published data thus establishing that the methods used were valid and could be successfully used to provide useful data for previously uncharacterised ligands For example as reported etorphine 19 and lofentanil 20 were shown to be highly potent and efficacious at opioid receptors Comparison of the efficacies of the set of agonists in this study to that of the endogenous ligand met enkephalin showed that all were full agonists Moreover fentanyl metazocine and xorphanol could be considered super agonists at delta receptors based on having efficacies significantly greater than met enkephalin This observation suggests that in situations where the endogenous ligand is present such as in a stressed animal it is possible to achieve further activation of opioid receptors by the application of one of these ligands Moreover the efficacies of the above super agonists were comparable to that of selective ligands such as SNC80 and BW373U86 Based on previous reports maximum inhibitory effect of SNC 80 in transfected opioid receptors is 71 5 21 and 94 2 22 with IC 50 values of 15 and 6 3 nM respectively The maximum effect of BW373U86 has been reported to be 70 9 with IC 50 of 0 9 nM 21 Some ligands that exhibited very low potencies in this study such as fentanyl or metazocine were amongst the most efficacious ligands tested suggesting that these ligands are capable of maximally activating opioid receptors Thus different concentrations of these ligands can be used to achieve various physiological effects based on the pharmacological properties of these ligands on other opioid receptors Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid ligand belonging to the phenylpiperidine family of ligands Based on receptor binding assays fentanyl has an affinity for opioid receptors that is 100 1000 fold higher than that for opioid receptors 23 24 However no published activation data for fentanyl at opioid receptors was available In vivo fentanyl is a strong analgesic agent in pharmacological doses due to its interaction with opioid receptors 19 However at higher toxic doses it shows general opioid toxicity symptoms in addition to muscular rigidity which are reversible by naloxone Muscular rigidity of fentanyl has been suggested to occur via several mechanism involving glutamatergic pathways 25 serotonergic system 26 as well as noradrenergic system 27 28 One other potential pathway may be via regulation of dopaminergic system as suggested before 29 possibly via opioid receptor system as explained here It has been reported that stimulation of opioid receptors can cause inhibition of dopamine release in striatal pathways resulting in muscular rigidity 19 The present report shows that although fentanyl has low affinity and low potency at opioid receptor it is highly efficacious at these receptors Thus at high fentanyl concentrations opioid receptors can also be fully activated possibly leading to the inhibition of dopamine release and the resultant muscle rigidity So the data presented can serve to describe the mechanism of action and physiological observations after application of drugs in vivo Based on the present data a distinct effect of morphine compared to fentanyl can be observed at opioid receptors While fentanyl is a full agonist at opioid receptors morphine is only a partial agonist Thus although both these drugs can activate opioid receptors with low potency at high concentrations morphine cannot stimulate receptor as effectively as fentanyl Thus fentanyl but not morphine can elicit physiological changes that are mediated by activation of opioid receptors A different scenario holds true for the two ligands xorphanol and WIN 44 441 Both these ligands have high affinities and potencies at opioid receptors with xorphanol being very efficacious at opioid receptors At opioid receptors however the activation profiles of these ligands are different While both these ligands bind with high affinities less than 1 nM to opioid receptors WIN 44 441 acts as an antagonist at opioid receptors and xorphanol is a very weak agonist at opioid receptor Gharagozlou et al unpublished results Thus these ligands can be useful in clinical applications where activation of opioid receptors needs to be combined with a weak action or an antagonistic action at opioid receptors Such an application can be very important due to the unique physiology of opioid receptors Studies such as presented here can serve to provide the data necessary for application of opioid ligands in such unique settings Moreover until now the activity of xorphanol at opioid receptors had not been described This ligand had been described as a mixed agonist antagonist opioid ligand 30 31 with agonistic activity at opioid receptors 32 Overall very little work has been done on xorphanol and little is known about it except that it is an orally active analgesic with limited physical dependence liability 30 Thus the present report describing its activity at opioid receptors provides useful data on this ligand Nalorphine has been previously categorized as a mixed agonist antagonist ligand 6 These are ligands that are believed to act as an agonist at and as an antagonist at opioid receptors No published in vitro data was available for the activation profile of this ligand at opioid receptors In this study nalorphine was shown to be an antagonist at opioid receptor with a moderate binding affinity Such a moderate affinity makes it possible for nalorphine to antagonize the effect of other ligands or the endogenous ligand like met enkephalin at opioid receptors while possibly acting as an agonist at other opioid receptors Based on the regulatory role of opioid receptors such applications may be numerous Data similar to the one presented in this report will open the door for novel applications of these ligands in the treatment of various ailments Conclusions The present study was designed to characterize the activation profiles of a set of opioid ligands in cells expressing only opioid receptors These ligands had not been previously characterized at opioid receptors The data produced from this study can be used to achieve several goals 1 These data can lead to elucidation of the complete activation profiles of these ligands leading to clarification of the mechanisms involved in physiological effects of these ligands at opioid receptor 2 These data can be used as a basis for novel use of existing opioid ligands based on their pharmacology at opioid receptors 3 These in vitro data can be utilized to define the physiochemical features of the ligands defining agonism and antagonism at opioid receptors leading to design and discovery of novel opioid analgesics 4 In combination with in vivo data characterizing analgesic and unwanted effects of these ligands the in vitro data can be used to identify the activation profile of the ideal opioid analgesic that has minimal side effects Such information combined with the knowledge on the physiochemical characteristics of the agonists and antagonists at each receptor will lead to the design of novel opioid analgesics with minimal side effects Methods Cell culture Human Embryonic Kidney HEK 293 cells were maintained in D MEM F 12 Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium Nutrient Mixture F 12 1 1 mixture supplemented with 10 v v fetal calf
