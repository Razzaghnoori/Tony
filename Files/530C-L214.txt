 Name Address City ST Zip Dear Name It is my privilege to extend an opportunity for membership in the Maennerchor Society of the Indiana University School of Law Indianapolis As you know the membership of this group includes those friends and alumni who contribute 1 000 or more annually to the law school As a member of the Law Alumni Board Board of Visitors you are quite well acquainted with the programs progress and problems of the law school Without engaging in too much repetition I might note a few items of interest The student lounge has at long last 20 years been completely refurbished due to a gift from Elizabeth M Daily J D 1967 It is now an inviting place for students to study and visit Judge Sam Rosen of Nashville Indiana Harvard J D 1933 established a charitable remainder annuity trust in honor of his longtime friend and colleague Cleon H Foust His 500 000 gift designated for faculty support is the largest single private gift ever received by the school Applications for enrollment remain high and the quality of entering students is excellent The school received 1 437 applications to seat 260 students in the 1992 entering class In contrast to this rosy picture there are still significant opportunities for improvement in the physical facilities and programs at the law school Several are noted below Scholarships are essential for attracting the best and brightest students to study law at our school For the 1991 1992 academic year only 135 00 was available for scholarship assistance This figure represents only 5 of the total cost that law students paid for their legal education It is far less than is available at most law schools including Bloomington spent 279 000 for scholarships during the same time period Approximately 100 students which is about 1 7 of our student body received scholarships funded through private gifts last year Statistics for the current academic year are the same A consultant s report on the law school library indicates the need for improvement in that area The report concluded The Law Library s space is inadequate in both quality and quantity to provide satisfactory let alone excellent services to users shelving for the collection and staff offices The Law Library s funding is insufficient to allow for appropriate collection development and maintenance to hire a sufficient number of employees especially professional librarians After evaluating the law school building the I U Architect s Office advised The space presently occupied by the School of Law and Law Library is deficient both in quality and quantity Quality improvements needed chiefly involve spatial relationships among functional areas personal security needs electronic access to information effective access to modern instructional technology and aesthetics of public areas of the school Quantitative deficiencies chiefly derive from library growth but also from growing program diversity e g clinics research institutes new journals from changing pedagogical techniques e g smaller classes use of technology and from a longstanding shortage of student support space lockers food service offices for student organizations Information regarding inadequate classrooms moot court facilities offices the library and support service areas follow the above paragraphs Other needs might also be recited The current recession and political concerns regarding taxation make increased legislative appropriations unlikely Student tuition has been raised 12 for 1992 92 a significant increase Although tuition at the School of Law Indianapolis still remains among the lowest of the Big Ten law schools further increases could have an adverse effect on securing quality students These factors increase the need for financial support from alumni and friends I urge your consideration of joining the Maennerchor Society by making a gift of 1 000 per year If this is not possible please consider membership in the Dean s Council 500 999 annually Your gift or pledge may be made now with the pledge to be paid before December 31 1992 Thanks for your courtesy in reviewing this request It is our hope that all Board members will affirmatively respond and that each will provide some level of financial support for our school Sincerely John M Holt Chairman The Maennerchor Society enclosure
