                     OK um say your name and where you were born and then just tell a story                     OK         Name                     Yeah not the whole name just first and last         No big deal                     All right my name is Sarah Murphy and I was born in Charlotte NC and my story is um that my family has had a lake house for a very very long time and um Ive always been told that my greatgrandfather and all of us we have a tradition that usually every July th we go up there and we set off firecrackers and just kind of watch the neighbors and see their firecrackers         And we just take a boat ride and do a cookout and all this         So Ive always been told that my greatgrandfather whom Ive never met one time was up at the lake and they were doing their traditional July th deal um and they were setting off the firecrackers and he accidentally just I guess got some messed up firecrackers or set them off too soon or what not but he was right there and they kind of blew his fingers off         So that was really and Ive always been told that and like I said Ive never met him or anything but I was just kind of surprised that that happened and it taught me I guess to never go near firecrackers         I dont go within ten feet of them         So thats my story I guess                     Good         OK
