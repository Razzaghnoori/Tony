 OK um say your name and where you were born and then just tell a story OK Name Yeah not the whole name just first and last No big deal All right my name is Sarah Murphy and I was born in Charlotte NC and my story is um that my family has had a lake house for a very very long time and um I ve always been told that my great grandfather and all of us we have a tradition that usually every July 4th we go up there and we set off firecrackers and just kind of watch the neighbors and see their firecrackers And we just take a boat ride and do a cookout and all this So I ve always been told that my great grandfather whom I ve never met one time was up at the lake and they were doing their traditional July 4th deal um and they were setting off the firecrackers and he accidentally just I guess got some messed up firecrackers or set them off too soon or what not but he was right there and they kind of blew his fingers off So that was really and I ve always been told that and like I said I ve never met him or anything but I was just kind of surprised that that happened and it taught me I guess to never go near firecrackers I don t go within ten feet of them So that s my story I guess Good OK
