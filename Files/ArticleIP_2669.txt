 Suicide Watch On April 2 this year Air Force Capt Craig Button suddenly went missing in an A 10 Thunderbolt fighter finally crashing in Colorado The evidence released by the Air Force this month indicates suicide Why he did it is baffling however The case violates even psychiatrists common notions about why people kill themselves Button flew the third aircraft in a three jet formation that left an Arizona Air Force base at 10 45 a m When the team reached the target bombing range the flight leader ordered pilots to update their computers Button confirmed the order at 11 57 Moments later when the leader radioed in preparation for the bombing run Button did not respond The lead plane swung around to catch sight of Button Despite 40 mile visibility Button was nowhere to be found Ground radar however picked him up Apparently Button turned 100 degrees off his flight path and flew 500 miles straight into central Colorado His altitude veered wildly Sometimes he hugged terrain below 2 000 feet Other times he glided above 16 000 feet Near Gold Dust Peak he circled more than 360 degrees then careened downward below the reach of ground radar Reconstructed AWACs radar data showed Button briefly climbed back up to 19 000 feet a mile above the highest mountain Minutes later at 1 40 p m he slammed into Gold Dust Peak at 13 000 feet Button didn t use any of his three radios He didn t eject He didn t attempt to land at any airports he flew over He didn t turn on his Friend or Foe identification signal to let others track him Yet Button s difficult maneuvers show that the plane functioned well and that he had full consciousness and capacity The autopilot would have been incapable of these maneuvers Everything indicated that Button deliberately flew into the mountain What a strange suicide though Button had hardly any risk factors True he was male women attempt suicide more often but men succeed five times more And he had long tussled with his Jehovah s Witness parents over his abandoning the faith organized religion lowers suicide rates But nothing else fit Over 90 percent of suicide victims have a history of mental illness most often depression or substance abuse Button had neither On a recent visit to see him his parents thought he was his energetic driven self Friends said he was enthusiastic about his coming assignment to Germany He spoke of buying a motorcycle there and maybe finding a girl to bring home He had had girlfriends before but after three years in the desert town of Del Rio Texas he joked to a friend it was slim pickings The night before the crash his roommate said he d ordered a large pizza so he d have leftovers for the next night During the mission briefing on the fateful day Button was cutting up and making his corny little jokes just as he usually did Button showed no signs of substance abuse No alcohol or drugs were found during the autopsy He was in a stressful job but that alone does not increase suicidal tendencies At 32 Button was young whereas the incidence of suicide increases with age and is highest among those over 65 Harvard psychiatrist Martin Kelly points out however that in rare cases suicide may not be motivated by emotional pain For someone who doesn t attach meaning to death yet suicide can be a sudden rash way out of trouble Button seemed like such a person It wasn t just that he was a motorcycle riding fighter pilot He had a history of foolhardy judgment that suggested he didn t fully comprehend death s finality During survival training in 1988 he was reprimanded for venturing recklessly far into uncharted wilderness In 1996 against the rules he buzzed Del Rio below 3 000 feet blew a tire attempting a hotshot short landing and left the authorized route during a cross country training mission Button was impulsive a thrill seeker When Button boarded his plane that day Kelly suggests suicide probably wasn t his plan but his impulsiveness may have steered him into trouble and then into suicide It s conceivable that he veered off on a whim Perhaps he took a short joy ride or prematurely dropped a bomb his four 500 pound bombs are still missing Whatever the case with each misstep he dug his hole deeper As Button flew through Colorado he may have come to see crashing as a viable way out because death had no meaning for him As unusual as Button s case is it shares one common characteristic with nearly all the 30 000 suicides that occur each year in the United States the victims are not in a rational state of mind That may seem an obvious point but it is one that we often ignore when assisted suicide is the topic Like Mark Twain who said that suicide is the only sane thing the young or old ever do in this life we imagine that the elderly and the ill desire death rationally But our prejudices are showing Suicidal patients whatever their age or condition almost always suffer from addiction or mental disease Even when they do not as with Button they usually are not thinking rationally Button s suicide also shows how even in peculiar cases the desire to die arises from one s individual history and psychology Yet in public discussion of youthful suicide we re often unwilling to trace it to such causes and try to place blame elsewhere on television music movies Earlier this month a Senate subcommittee considering stricter restrictions on music lyrics heard an anguished father blame his son s suicide on shock rocker Marilyn Manson s music The 15 year old died with the band playing on his headphones Numerous studies show that there is no association between music and suicide One found that country music lovers had higher suicide rates but subsequent research disputes these results Of course ideas do count We know for example that one adolescent suicide can trigger others even through media reports leading to suicide clusters Had later victims not heard about the first suicide they may not have done it when they did But psychiatrists insist that an idea cannot compel even a child to commit suicide It is only a proximate factor in a vulnerable person with stronger causes at work Usually the causes are an addictive or mental disorder Craig Button s case shows how much more complex they can be And how bizarre
