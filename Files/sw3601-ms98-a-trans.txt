                what i like in a good job is i like good salary but also i think they should have insurance benefits and profit sharing and retirement funds like that so that you can plan for the future and they dont do that any more like they used to in the big companies   well i i i agree with what you say and of course uh in addition to what you mentioned uh you know id like to see them have some uh have more companies have like dental care   yes uhhuh   and uh   medical and dental   yeah and more benefits for uh working mothers uh   thats right   i noticed here lately theres some companies have been providing what they kind of call an inhouse day care center where the mothers can come and leave their uh children with somebody locally at the company and go to work and if something happens theyre immediately there   thats great oh wouldnt that be great   yeah i have a couple of teenagers i have a couple of daughters uh one of which is married and has two two small sons   uhhuh   and they stay in a day care and and they have a lot of sickness because theyre around the other children   yeah yeah   and it would be so nice if uh the company she worked for provided that uh you know in house or or nearby or   thats right   now there is there is one benefit that uh is uh offered now um where they pay they pay they pay for hospitalization uh with funds uh before income tax funds uh before with funds that are not taxed   oh   but i think thats more or less kind of in the group insurance field   uhhuh   so thats a new innovation too for a benefit   well that inhouse day care is excellent they could go on their lunch hour and see their kids or any time   yeah uhhuh yeah thats true and uh lets see what other benefits do you have any others uh that youd like to see how about uh   well i the profit sharing and the retirement they just dont offer those like they used to   yeah in the old days of course they didnt have any any benefits at all they preached job security but that that went out fast   yeah oh it didnt thats right   and uh so now days i guess funding takes part or rather uh uh your benefits are locked in after youre there with a company for five years but the benefits are so small   umhum   and usually theyre tied in with social security and uh it   most people retire on social security now thats all they have   yeah right and uh so uh even if you have benefits and you and then when you get to social security age theyre not as great because theyre tied in to social security benefits so you dont get both of them in full   uhhuh   so its hard today to live off of social security if you dont have your home paid for   thats right thats right   so uh   thats what my folks did theyre just living on social security they had  two houses and they were trying to buy sell one to pay off the other one and oh they waited for like four or five years trying to  sell that one house   umhum   so they could pay off the other one because theyre just living on social security they had a real hard time   i see   yeah you got to have your house paid for   well you know uh benefits uh are great and uh the more that a company can provide the better off we are but its so hard now for companies to make a profit as you no doubt uh   uhhuh   know you know most of our companies uh are losing their shirt   thats right thats right   going bankrupt and uh so some kind of system has to be devised were more  more competitive perhaps weve uh uh been uh we were too used to off time and all these benefits that are not uh taking care of us in our old age but were getting immediate effect of them like for example like seven hour days and and uh when in effect while were young we ought to be working harder and come up with better benefits so that when we get older we have the uh   umhum   we we have those benefits available to us in in a need that would make it easy for us in retirement   yeah they dont have to work so hard umhum   uh you know social security again most of the young people today are paying in they dont have any any they dont believe that anything will be left over   umhum umhum   when they get to retirement age course the old bank never gets out you know   i heard that all my life there wasnt going to be any when i was on it   yeah uhhuh and uh so uh   or when i got on it   i guess uh we can make our dollar go lower and lower and lower until you get to zero and then everybody can say okay nobody has anything and start over again   yeah well the insurance thats thats the main thing that i worry about is the insurance   umhum insurance costs are going up   well and they and they just
