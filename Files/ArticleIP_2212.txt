 Then and Now Then and Now Jacob Weisberg s Strange Bedfellow column this week comes to the defense of Seymour Hersh s new book on JFK which is surfing a tidal wave of derision to the best seller list We hope Weisberg s revelation that the book is not as awful as people say it is won t hurt its sales too much Meanwhile the reminder of how much fun Kennedy had in the White House raises once again the question Could a president get away with it today And the even more intriguing question OK how Fortunately those vital questions were answered by Slate s David Plotz last year in his definitive study Could Clinton Cheat The logistics of presidential adultery As far as we know the president has not taken advantage of Plotz s advice during the past year Heads Up For the past couple of weeks we have been posting quietly in primitive form a new Slate feature that emerges fully this week Called Pundit Central it is to start a summary and analysis posted Monday morning of who said what on the weekend political talk shows and how the ball was moved as a result on various issues It will also treat the print pundits though less comprehensively Like our other Briefing features Pundit Central can be used either as a guide for what to read and watch or as an efficient and we hope entertaining substitute for reading and watching In case Pundit Central whets your appetite instead of sating it the page includes an extensive set of links to Web sites where the pundits and panjandrums can be found in their full glory Come to Pundit Central and you ll never want for an opinion again You ll be able to mix n match say David Broder from the Washington Post on the new Paris fashions Maureen Dowd from the New York Times on local traffic conditions and Liz Smith of Newsday on the Thai currency crisis to create your own op ed dream team The page also includes links to talk show transcripts and newspaper editorial pages But what is the best collective noun for people who make their living spouting opinions in one medium or another or as is increasingly the case in all of them Punditocracy the term most often used is clumsy The commentariat a word coined in a Washington Post editorial a few years back is much wittier Pundit Central uses both It attempts to avoid the stale dismissive clich talking heads but sometimes in a hurry does refer to the breed with simple dignity as the heads Having Written Last week s Readme touting Slate s Hackathlon a contest among four journalists for the title to be awarded by Slate readers vote of world s biggest hack credited Gloria Steinem with the remark I don t like writing I like having written A reader wrote in to say the remark actually belongs to Gertrude Stein which we were prepared to believe until another reader sent indignant e mail on behalf of Dorothy Parker which seems even more plausible No one so far has nominated Lillian Hellman or Anita Loos or Catherine the Great but if anyone can supply actual evidence of the woman or man who made this remark we d be grateful and we ll let the rest of you know E mail read slate com Do You Still Beat Your Husband As of Thursday Nov 13 six days after it was posted more than 5 000 Slate readers had responded to our online reader survey Last year we were pretty thrilled to get 3 000 plus responses in a month Thanks to all who ve spent a few minutes telling us about themselves If you haven t filled it out yet click here for the survey We d appreciate it Michael Kinsley
