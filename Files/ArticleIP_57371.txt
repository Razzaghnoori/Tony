 The Sweet Spot There are a lot of amazing actors in the world but with Sean Penn each performance is amazing in a different way As Emmet Ray the fictional 1940s jazz guitarist in Woody Allen s unexpectedly delectable Sweet and Lowdown he lifts his voice about an octave and wears a small waxed mustache as if it were a fancy hood ornament Only the mention of Django Reinhardt the great gypsy guitarist pops his bubble of self worship sending him into sweats and in some cases unconsciousness The rest of the time he s a preening cock fond of quoting without irony a rapturous critic I m meee rac ulous When he plays he folds himself intimately over his guitar and silently moves his lips as if whispering sweet nothings to it Penn s expression of stewed soulfulness parodies this twerpy egotist and exalts him at the same time Actually it s the music that exalts him Penn does the intricate finger work himself while on the soundtrack Howard Alden gives the solos a Reinhardt like mix of limpidness and bite The idea of a jazz guitarist who s also a textbook Freudian hysteric loose and yet focused when he s onstage an anxious buffoon when he s off has comic poetry built into it and Penn has radar for both the comedy and the poetry It s the way he blends them though that is uncanny He s like a great jazz artist Emmet Ray is the protagonist of Woody Allen s dreams a narcissistic shit who s also an artistic titan The conceit works better here than in Deconstructing Harry 1997 where the hero a cross between Allen and Phillip Roth screwed up his own and other people s lives but was let off the hook because he brought so much meaning into the world through his books Frankly it s not Allen s place to forgive himself for all the bad things he has done or for that matter to assess his own talents With Sweet and Lowdown he has made the tension between an artist s work and life more archetypal and more funny In mock documentary fashion the story of Emmet is relayed by jazz historians and critics among them Ben Duncan Nat Hentoff and Allen himself who set the scene for hilarious anecdotes about the guitarist s unreliability profligacy and terror of encountering Django Reinhardt Emmet has an infantile indifference to everyone and everything except his own needs To women who fall for him he spews such unprocessed bilge as I gotta be free I m an artist But just when you think you ve had enough of Emmet s whining self aggrandizement and emotional cowardice Allen plays a trump card that beautiful music Maybe it s wishful thinking on my part but Sweet and Lowdown feels like penance for Barbara Kopple s bleak documentary Wild Man Blues 1998 which chronicled Allen s European tour with his New Orleans style jazz band When he watched himself perform in those vast tony theaters did Allen think what the rest of us were thinking that this isn t how jazz is meant to be heard The way he shoots the music here is tender and uninsistent the camera floats past the tables of listeners until it comes to Emmet and his wonderfully pickled look of concentration The note of satire in Penn s performance is a hedge against the reverence that dampened such jazz sagas as Bertrand Tavernier s Round Midnight 1986 while the gorgeousness of the playing is a hedge against the satire The story takes a moralistic turn Emmet pays both an artistic and a personal price for not risking more of himself emotionally But the film doesn t bog down in loathing self or otherwise the way Allen s last work Celebrity 1998 did He adores this milieu too much he probably wishes he d been born into it And he s in the buoyant tall tale mode of The Purple Rose of Cairo 1985 With cinematographer Zhao Fei production designer Santo Loquasto and costume designer Laura Cunningham Bauer Allen re creates the world of urban supper clubs where gangsters mingle with jazz artists and high society vamps and where the music itself seems to smooth over class distinctions Early on Emmet picks up the tab for a table of tuxedo clad African American musicians then goes home with them to drink and jam He stumbles back to his hotel via the dump where he shoots the breeze with hobos and indulges in his favorite form of recreation picking off rats with his 45 Allen has never made a movie where the jokes seemed so offhand yet so precise so beat perfect He must have wanted to freshen his approach this time out Why else would this famously settled director pick both a mainland Chinese cinematographer who reportedly came with a team of translators and a different kind of lead actor one who wouldn t mimic Allen s diction like Mia Farrow in Purple Rose and Kenneth Branagh in Celebrity Of course there are aspects of Sweet and Lowdown that don t seem so fresh when you re out from under its spell The conception of women for instance Allen still thinks along the same lines as in Manhattan 1979 where the open and inarticulate teen ager Mariel Hemingway stood for purity a man s hope of salvation while such overeducated older types as Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep the lesbian ex wife were like sucking swamps of neurosis and infidelity The purity here is embodied by Hattie Samantha Morton a mute laundress whom Emmet picks up on a New Jersey boardwalk The other extreme is represented by Blanche Uma Thurman a sleek and edgy sophisticate who has affairs with lowlifes as research for novels Allen is clearly letting Emmet have a taste of his own medicine Blanche doesn t say I ve gotta be free I m an artist but that s the implication The problem is that he can t bring himself to give Blanche any soul And what a stroke making the feminine ideal a mute who does laundry always a big plus Allen struck gold when he cast Morton however An English actress known for her BBC Jane Eyre 1997 and an incendiary turn in the little seen Under the Skin 1997 she has a dimpled half smile a slightly bobbing walk and the manner of a pixilated silent movie ragamuffin The part is all mugging pulling Harpo like faces but Morton turns it into a delicious tease always seeming on the verge of speech of saying something naughty or funny or caustic She appears not to talk because she just thinks better of it As Hattie gazes serenely on Emmet after their first coupling he keeps up both ends of the conversation Did ya like that I knew you would I was 7 when I first had sex She worships him and sees right through him and a part that might have seemed a sentimental contrivance becomes the source of comic bliss Sweet and Lowdown is a small comedy it s monaural not stereo and purposefully distant But it has a touch of magic At one point Allen gives you several versions of the same climactic scene it varies according to the historian and the effect of all those farcical possibilities is elating a Rashomon like sequence where you don t give a damn what actually happened Each variation is more entertainingly outlandish and in the last when Emmet finally sees Django Reinhardt Penn caps it with one of the great movie swoons Everything he does hits the sweet spot The best of many good reasons to see Tumbleweeds is Janet McTeer who plays a hopeful 40 ish mom who bounces from boyfriend to boyfriend and state to state with her cynical adolescent daughter Kimberly J Brown in tow McTeer an English actress who won a 1997 Tony award for her Nora in A Doll s House gives a performance that is so gorgeously modulated you ll think she has been in movies all her life It helps that her character Mary Jo is a ham Fixing breakfast she dances around the kitchen and sticks her tongue out at her lover as if razzing her own domesticity The actress uses her whole slinky frame lots of leg and lots of cleavage to show how this busting out babe is too alive for the blue collar he men she takes up with It s no wonder that her daughter Ava who has the heavy spirit of a child forced to be more farsighted than her parent gravitates to theater where one s exhibitionism can be harnessed It s maybe also no wonder that given where her mother s feminine instincts have led she takes the part of Romeo instead of Juliet Gavin O Connor plays the dull witted trucker who s Mary Jo s latest conquest and he also directed the movie and co wrote the screenplay with Angela Shelton The story is based on Shelton s childhood memoirs Beat by dramatic beat these are some of the most nuanced scenes in a film all year O Connor is a fabulous actor s director Maybe too fabulous The actors appear to be entertaining themselves so much that some of the tension dissipates and the ease with which the movie goes down ends up working against it Tumbleweeds could use some dissonances I m a little fuzzy for instance on this family s finances They don t want for food or a roof over their heads and they end up with no visible means of support on a nice little block in San Diego which isn t the cheapest housing in the country I miss the rawness that Gillian Armstrong brought to another mother daughter story High Tide 1987 The foundations here are just a little too sturdy Tumbleweeds seems on the brink of tumbling into a TV series
