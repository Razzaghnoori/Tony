 I m going to um tell you something about my um cousin whose name was Deirdre and ah I I I ll give a little bit of background just it needs to it needs to be put into a little bit of a context Ah I was very very fond of my my cousin um she was she was a very beautiful person both physically and and spiritually She was very tall she was very elegant um and she also just she had a a radiance about her it was really ah irresistible She had an irresistible quality she just drew people to her And um she was her her mother was my father s sister was highly neurotic dramatic dissatisfied woman who had been married a couple of times before she married Deirdre s father and uh when she married Deirdre s father he had he was he was a a a very sort ah of reclusive um scholar He was a philosopher and also a psy uh a psychologist And he he was a professor at at um Hunter But he came from a an extremely exclusive family um they were his name was Livingston Welch and it it s a very old American family the Livingston s and the Welch s And when they combined the families they they ah he was sort of their the legacy is in him was that he was Livingston Welch both families Anyway he was a real character Uncle Livingston And a brilliant man uh but incredibly eccentric And he had been in love with my with my father s sister since they were very little They grew up on on Long Island sort of in Great Gatsby land Um in Sand s Point My my father s family were were in a little area called um Plandome which is next to Manhassett which is right next to Sand s Point and Sand s Point is is perhaps where the the richest people in America live And um they ah they knew each other and he was in love with her but she wouldn t have anything to do with him She because he was he was a nerd A very rich nerd but a nerd And um my father s family were probably nouveau riche in in in their estimation My my my father s um my father s parents were both English They didn t meet in England they met here but both both of their families had immigrated to this to this country and um they my my grandfather was in banking and um they he made obviously a very nice income But not quite on the level of the Welch s um who subsequently lost all of their money which is always the way it is in life Ah but anyway so there was this whole social thing And they were they were a part of a social milieu that my father s family were close to but not quite in And um ultimately when my when my aunt finally went through her other husbands ah she decided that really she was ready for some social status and perhaps some money and so she acquiesced to to marry my uncle And they had a very peculiar marriage And at some point along the way and I don t know the historical details they the Welch s did lose all of their money and they they had had this beautiful mansion on on Sand s Point um and it was right at the very tip of Sand s Point and they had an absolutely beautiful town home in um in Manhattan on 65th Street ah right between Park Avenue and Lexington Avenue so it was the sort of the place to be so to speak And eventually they they were Livingston in his older in his old age was relegated to the to the kitchen in the sub basement of the building because they sold it to to some woman in New Orleans but they d kept that part of the building and he loved it that was for him that was like that was the greatest Ah by that time he and my aunt were living in in uh you know sort of uh uh an apartment in on East 57th Street that was just one of those sort of those little run through apartments And it wasn t a bad apartment but nonetheless it was you know not certainly my my aunt s idea of why she might have been ma been marrying my uncle It wasn t quite what she had in mind And they had also stuffed all of this really beautiful furniture um from all over the world into this tiny little apartment so it was very cluttered Ah and ah first she she got pregnant and I don t know how they ever managed to consummate the marriage because by the time I knew them as a couple they were um my aunt dressed all in black and uh she as I said she was very neurotic she was also very very dramatic and everything was over stated and they obviously could couldn t stand each other by this time although they were never rude to each other they just lived completely separate lives And she hurt because she had worn really high heels and she d been a model when she was she was she had been really stunningly beautiful in the thirties and um when she had modeled And uh but she had worn these really really high heels because she was incredibly vain and her arches had fallen so she had to wear these big thick black shoes which she hated So she would be sort of roaming around the the apartment with all of her her drama and her her overstatement and my uncle who barely ever came home if he could help it ah would live in this one tiny room at the very very front of the apartment that overlooked 57th Street and uh he had nailed down the windows because he didn t want to have any fresh air because he he believed that fresh air was really bad for you But he basically spent all this time in the in the kitchen in the sub basement of what had once been his family home And he had a a German mistress um who everybody knew about ah who sort of took ca took care of him and looked after him and adored him but my aunt couldn t be bothered with him Anyway out of out of this wonderful marriage he d produced these two daughters one of whom was Deirdre who as I said just was this incredibly beautiful person And ah my my family are are Episcopalian hardly practicing but nonetheless that s my my grandmother had been a very uh very religious woman and she she was she made sure that that all of the children were were Christened and um and that certainly my sister and I were um Confirmed The Welch s were Catholic And ah for some reason and I don t know who made this decision Deirdre both Pamela and Deirdre my two cousins were sent to ah Catholic school in Tarrytown and um they for some reason according to my aunt who was very hysterical about the whole thing they always recruit some of the young women into the convent according to her So as I said you know Deirdre was extremely beautiful very elegant and all of these things so she was not perceived as as being a candidate for quote as the family put it to escape from the world but to be out there in the world with all of her her charms and graces and and what have you And ah anyway she she decide she said that she was that she made this decision that she was going to go into the convent and become a nun And of course everybody in the family was absolutely hysterical and put out about this but my and my aunt her her her her response to the whole thing was that she needed to see a psychiatrist meaning my aunt needed to see a psychiatrist to get her over the the pain and the loss of her daughter having made this decision So uh but anyway Deirdre was really she she she was a she really believed that that s what she wanted and that was what she should do And uh as I go along I ll I ll talk a little bit more about you know my my family s interpretation of this whole thing because that s part of what when I when I think of Deirdre and I think of the loss of Deirdre some of what I try to come to terms with is why why my family interpreted her choice the way they did But um because the the general consensus was that she was too scared or somehow felt insecure and she couldn t be a part of the world they never they never said Oh she she did this because this is what she believes You know it was simply that Oh she doesn t know what she s doing and she s misguided and she s scared that was the general consensus Anyway she became a nun and um I would go and visit her And um she was she became she was a teaching nun she taught in a school um Marymount was the name of the uh of the convent and and the school and they had a a school in Tarrytown but they also had a school in Manhattan She ultimately ended up teaching art because she was a very very gifted artist um at Marymount And when I would go over first she was at Tarrytown initially and I would go over and I would visit her from time to time and it was always just a joy to you know to see her And at that time this was this was before Vatican II and she was fully garbed and it was and it was strange because I had been very close to her I was very little when but she was very very kind to me and she was always very interested in me and would take me places and include me and so it was strange for me to you know suddenly see her in in in um all in black ah with profuse robes and she had a the um head dress was very it was it was shaped like this it was so you um really could not see very much of her face so that was that was a very strange thing for me but she always seemed happy So in that context I never questioned it You know it was just wonderful to see her And um and then there was a part of it too where I felt like she looked beautiful in wearing what she was wearing I mean they were they were in some way just the garb is very medieval and it s it s it is certainly more interesting than some of what we wear you know in in that sense But so there as a child there was that kind of uh a sense of it was strange but it was also interesting you know Um at some point she was sent to Spain And at that time Spain and I and I am not very good on dates and and um historical happenings but at that time Franco was was in um was in control in Spain and they were there was there was the Church was not um was definitely repressed and there was a lot of political things happening But that s where she was and so there the family was obviously concerned because she was in a in a country that was under a lot of strife and conflict and and she was an in a part of an institution that was definitely not only not supported but was actually persecuted And um she at that time she contracted cancer but nobody knew about it because they um th th the situation in Spain was was such that there wasn t a lot of medical um assistance for for nuns and other uh members of the clergy So it it went undiagnosed By the time she came back to this country um she wa she was diagnosed and she had cancer of the uterus and she was completely I mean she just was she was very very sick So they had to operate and they ha they took out everything Um and uh but of course you know it would be obviously more of a tragedy if she was somebody who was planning to get married and have children So she was I think that she was she was comfortable with it in the sense that she it wasn t part of her destiny so to speak but it was it was still a very traumatic thing to experience And then she she was she she was because she was convalescing they she stayed in New York they they didn t send her overseas again And she she was teaching at Marymount and I would go in and visit her And um she she was also taking classes at the Art Students League and I was taking classes at the Art Students League so we would pass in the halls and she would show me what she was doing and um and as I say she was a very gifted artist and she loved teaching and again she still seemed very you know I never got a sense with Deirdre of there may have been discontent there may have been a sense that maybe she had made wrong choices but um she never expressed that At some point this was right about the time of Vatican II because she started to wear different clothes and it was it was very um it was very discreet I mean she didn t suddenly just go out to Bloomingdale s and buy a whole lot of you know fashionable clothes but when I would go in to visit with my um with my aunt and if she was if she was there she was dressed in in um very very uh very elegant but understated you know suits and things like that but she definitely was no longer in the full garb And uh my aunt at that time had was diagnosed as having lung cancer and she was very sick So Deirdre took was took a leave from the convent she was given um permission to um for temporary leave and I don t know logistically how that works but she was she was allowed to go home and and be with her mother to help her um go through she was going to die I mean everybody knew that she was going to die but to be with her through that whole period and um she did have some operations And um at that point Deirdre made the decision and her mother did die and it was it was all very traumatic my father was very sick he s a manic depressive so we were going through all of that and he was very upset with the medical profession for how they were treating my aunt and this and that But anyway Deirdre made the decision that she wasn t going to go back to the convent And she had already taken final vows so it was a big it was a huge thing for her to make that decision But she did I never sat down and had discussions with her about it so I don t really know what was going on in her heart and in her in her mind But she made the decision that she was going to to leave and she and she started to she continued to teach she she continued to do the things that she was always doing but she just slowly started to to live what would be considered a normal life And she started to date and she had several boyfriends and uh she was she had met this one this one person and they were going to a some kind of social gathering in in Rye New York They went out and on the way back ah it was late at night um they were on the on the train platform waiting to take the train back into the into Manhattan and this this man who was drunk and his car went out of control and hit both of them and they were both thrown against the uh the railroad tracks And you know there was no train coming but they they hit the rails their and she both of them had severe head injuries And um she went to the hospital and at first they thought his condition was much worse than her condition they felt fairly um and I remember we got the the phone call came it was late at night and my father who was a was a psychiatrist but he was a neurologist psychiatrist so um anything to do with with the brain and the nervous system was um something that he was an expert on and he went over and ah the prognosis at that time was that sh they thought that she would pull out um but she never did And she she was in a coma for a week and she just continued to decline whereas this the man that she was with he he got better and he was really in worse condition when when they brought him in and yet he he regain he regained and within a couple of days he d regained full consciousness and he you know and she just she just um she just never came back And um I just had a I had a feeling that she made a decision not to come back And she died when we were there my sister and I were there and she just suddenly just she just let go and she just died And I think she died because she knew we were there and she made a decision for some reason that she didn t want to live in this world And um I ve often pondered that ev you know that this whole thing about that she that she became a nun because she didn t um she was scared to live fully in the world That there was something wrong with her that she made that decision that that was that was the impression that it was like the worst thing a person could could decide to do And I you know I I can t ask her because she s not here but you know I wonder well Why why was that always the interpretation I mean why wasn t why didn t we as a family try to support her more in the decision that she made and to see that maybe that there was that there was that she wasn t trying to run away from the world but that there was some greater truth that she was somehow privy to that she was actually running towards And um you know I I I wrote a long poem actually a twenty page poem about this and I you know I my question to you know to her would be you know Were you happier when you when you actually left the convent and you came into a world that was just you know uh striving after money and social status and all of those things I mean was that was that really a better choice you know was that really um you know did you did you feel more alive making that choice and actually dying under those conditions But I can t ask her I can only just go on asking myself sort of rhetorically you know When did you feel more real And then you know the question for my family is Why couldn t you accept her decision Why couldn t you believe in what she was striving for
