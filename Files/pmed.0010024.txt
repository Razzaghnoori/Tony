                            Acidosis is a major cause of death in patients with malaria although what causes        acidosis is still unclear One possibility is that hypovolemia contributes to the problem        and that rehydration therapy could be of benefit Now Sanjeev Krishna and colleagues have        shown that in children with severe malaria dehydration is not severe and is not correlated        with other measures of disease severity The optimum resuscitation approach in severe        childhood malaria remains to be defined says Nick White Mahidol University Thailand        the academic editor of the paper The relative advantages of blood colloids and        crystalloids need to be characterized        Every year around  million people worldwide contract malaria of whom over a million        die The vast majority of those who die are children under five years mostly in Africa        since young children have had little chance to acquire any immunity Fluid resuscitation is        generally considered to be a cornerstone of treatmentbut how much fluid should be given        Some researchers believe that surrogate signs of fluid depletionsuch as tachycardia        reduced capillary refill time and reduced urine excretionsuggest that there is        substantial volume depletion The reason that the amount of fluid given matters so much is        that giving too much especially of hypotonic solutions can lead to electrolyte imbalance        especially hyponatremia and hypokalemia        Research efforts have been hampered by not having an easy way to assess in patients the        fluid depletion in different compartments of the body ie total body water and        extracellular and intracellular water volume Krishna and colleagues used heavywater        distribution to calculate the total body water and bromide distribution to determine the        extracellular volume in  children with moderately severe malaria and  with severe        malaria in Gabon By subtracting extracellular volume from total body water they were able        to calculate intracellular volume for each child They also used a less invasive and more        rapid method of determining water volumes based on using bioelectrical impedance to        calculate the volume        None of the children were severely dehydrated defined as more than  mlkg        depletion and only three of the children with severe anemia had fluid depletion which        was moderate  mlkg depletion This challenges the view that dehydration is a major        contributor to the pathology of this frequently lethal disease says White        So based on these data obtained from a carefully studied albeit small group of        children what should people who treat children with malaria do The authors first        recommendation is that clinicians should think again about how vigorously they rehydrate        children and if they have access to ways of assessing fluid volume more precisely they        should do so not a trivial undertaking in many hospitals where these children are        treated And certainly the methods used by Krishna and colleagues should undergo wider        testing in larger groups of children to confirm their usefulness Until the worldwide        efforts to prevent malaria come to fruition refining the management of infected children        will remain a cornerstone of the efforts against this devastating disease
