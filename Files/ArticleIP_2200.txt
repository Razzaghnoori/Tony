 Naked SLATE Naked Slate John F Kennedy Jr who styles himself editor in chief and founder of George magazine has offered a considerable challenge to magazine editors everywhere by posing nude in the September issue of his publication For too long journalists have been content to expose other people Is it not time for them to start exposing themselves The thought of naked magazine editors with the exception of JFK Jr of course is not one many readers will find appealing Whatever reason one might have for subscribing to George the editor in chief s body is unlikely to be a major selling point for say Time or Newsweek But we in the magazine industry believe deeply if we believe anything at all that a trend is a trend and cannot be resisted Therefore naked editors it is Here at Slate though we eschew grandiose titles like editor in chief let alone founder At the special staff meeting called to discuss the issue of who should bare all for the good of the magazine there was a groundswell of support for calling upon the CEO of Microsoft but no one volunteered to make the call In the end the editor decided to delegate the challenge of self exposure to the New York editor who delegated it to an associate editor who delegated it to an assistant editor who delegated it to the youngest member of our staff Aidan Weed whose title is Special Issue of the Publisher Although Weed does not technically bare all he does unlike his rival in George refrain from making clever use of light and shadow to hide the aspects of the story that interest his readers the most Like Kennedy however Weed uses the occasion to vent some controversial opinions about his relatives His mother and father he reveals are just terrible parents They re driving me crazy with their eat this drink this go to sleep stop crying Weed shares Kennedy s tart views about his relatives relations with the baby sitter They just use her for their own pleasure he says I get stuck with her while they go out and party It s incredibly immature And why did Weed agree to put his body on the line or rather online It s a statement on the need for well it s a symbol of oh heck I don t know I m only nine months old But I d do anything for Slate he adds I just love that magazine Index Investing Daniel Akst s recent article arguing that investing in index mutual funds is evil has produced a heated response from Todd Porter a mutual fund analyst at Morningstar an independent financial publisher Akst could not be enticed into a dialogue on the subject to continue the theme of the previous item he and his wife just had twins but we publish Porter s response in E Mail to the Editors and take this opportunity to draw special attention to it Old Folks at Home Among the first people to join the staff of Slate way back in 1996 were Associate Publisher Betsy Davis and Program Manager Bill Barnes Both were longtime Microsoft employees 14 years in Betsy s case who happily embraced this different sort of software product and the different sort of people i e journalists it brought with it Now after Slate careers that span almost 18 months Betsy and Bill are both retiring at ages 40 and 30 respectively From which you may conclude either that Slate is a horrible place to work or that Microsoft is a great place to work As production manager and then associate publisher Betsy designed and supervised the process by which Slate gets from writers through editors to you Publishing on the Web is still very new and Slate s publication process with its daily postings e mail and print versions constant redesigns and so on is very complicated Betsy s logical mind and wonderful laugh among other gifts made it all happen well most of the time And what exactly is a program manager Bill liked to explain that on normal software projects the program manager is just that in charge of the program On Slate the program manager is in essence the chief computer guy in a nest of cybernaifs But Bill took amiably and skillfully to his ambassadorial function and is more responsible than any other person for designing the actual technology behind Slate He also has written our Webhead column and will continue to contribute to it All of us at Slate wish Betsy and Bill the best as they enter their Golden Years We ll miss you Michael Kinsley
