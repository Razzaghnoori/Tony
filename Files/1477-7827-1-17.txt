 Background Progesterone derived from the corpus luteum CL is required for the establishment and maintenance of a suitable uterine environment during early pregnancy 1 2 Inappropriate luteal function i e luteal insufficiency may contribute to the high incidence of spontaneous abortions that occur early in mammalian pregnancies 3 In most species the luteolytic cascade starting with loss of progesterone production and followed by tissue regression i e apoptosis is initiated by prostaglandin F 2 PGF 2 in vivo 4 However this process can only be partially recapitulated in vitro using primary cultures of steroidogenic cells Gonadotropin induced progesterone production is attenuated by PGF 2 treatment but this prostanoid does not activate apoptosis of bovine steroidogenic cells in vitro 8 These findings helped develop the concept that additional factors such as immune cells 5 6 7 or cytokines 7 8 contribute to the luteolytic process Indeed tumor necrosis factor TNF interferon gamma IFN and or interleukin 1 beta IL 1 have all been shown to reduce gonadotrophin induced progesterone synthesis in a number of species 8 9 10 11 12 and TNF and IFN are known to increase PGF 2 production by steroidogenic cells 13 14 15 Steroidogenic cell apoptotic paradigms are activated by cytokines generated by several cell types within the CL including immune cells and endothelial cells 7 11 16 The synergistic actions of IFN and TNF for example induce steroidogenic cell apoptosis 13 17 as does soluble Fas ligand FasL 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 Furthermore several acute intracellular signaling events either required for or associated with the functional and structural aspects of luteal regression have been mapped using in vitro steroidogenic cell cultures 8 27 28 The microvasculature of the CL is thought to be the first structure to undergo degeneration via apoptosis during luteolysis 2 8 In contrast to information available on steroidogenic cells of the CL a gap exists in our understanding of the factors and their associated signaling pathways that initiate apoptosis in the vascular component of the CL Elevated TNF activity may play a role in the apoptosis of CL derived microvascular endothelial CLENDO cells 29 TNF is known to initiate apoptosis in diverse cell types by activating its cognate receptor TNF RI a cell surface receptor and member of the tumor necrosis receptor super family TNFRSF TNF RI is also a death receptor based on the presence of a carboxy terminal functional domain known as the death domain The death domain serves as a binding domain for cytoplasmic adapter proteins which contain a death domain and a death effector domain i e Fas associated death domain FADD 30 ultimately activating members of the caspase family resulting in apoptosis Activation of TNFRI initiates stress activated pathways which often are associated with the onset of apoptosis in a cell specific fashion Of interest to these studies are the three subfamilies within the mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK superfamily including the extracellular signal related kinases ERKs p38 and c jun N terminal kinases JNKs 31 TNF is one of many cytokines involved in luteal regression Although the mechanism s by which cytokines induce apoptosis vary among cell types it is presumed that it involves either an increase in reactive oxygen species ROS or activation of stress related signaling pathways Interestingly it has been demonstrated that rapid production of ROS in endothelial cells exposed to TNF is mediated by ceramide 32 Ceramide is a central figure in the sphingomyelin pathway which has also been linked to stress related signaling and apoptosis 33 34 This report provides evidence that cytokines regulate the fate of CLENDO cells In the first set of experiments we identified those factors that initiate CLENDO cell death amongst a host of cytokines and lipid signaling molecules that mediate various aspects of luteal structural regression In a second series of experiments we evaluated the activation of several signal transduction pathways known to coordinate apoptosis in other cell types A working knowledge of the collective signaling network activated in CLENDO cells by specific death stimuli is essential to complete our understanding of how apoptosis is controlled within the CL Materials and Methods Cell culture and treatments Purified bovine CL derived microvascular endothelial cell populations were generated commercially by Cambrex Biosciences BioWhittaker Walkersville MD as described in detail 35 In the present study CLENDO cells from frozen aliquots passage 3 were seeded 5 000 cells cm 2 in 6 or 24 well plates or 10 cm culture dishes The cells were cultured in EGM 2MV as recommended by the supplier with progesterone 250 ng ml and 3 fetal bovine serum added Once 90 confluency was reached the medium was changed and the cultures were maintained in serum and growth factor free conditions EBM 2 medium for 24 h Medium was then removed once again and fresh serum and growth factor free medium was applied Cells were allowed to equilibrate for a minimum of 3 h prior to treatment Treatment concentrations were based upon previously published in vitro studies of mixed luteal cells 13 14 15 17 29 36 and all experiments were completed a minimum of three times To identify putative luteolytic factors that initiate CLENDO cell apoptosis cells were treated with TNF 50 ng ml Upstate Biotechnology Inc Lake Placid NY bovine IFN 200 IU ml generous gift from Dr Dale Godson Veterinary Infectious

specificity of ceramide in triggering CLENDO cell death cultures were treated with sphingosine 1 phosphate S1P 10 or 50 M BioMol Plymouth Meeting PA for 48 h Furthermore to determine if S1P attenuated ceramide or TNF induced cell death CLENDO cells were first pretreated with S1P for 30 min followed by application of ceramide 50 M or TNF 50 ng ml Finally to evaluate the impact of glutathione GSH a known inhibitor of TNF induced ROS formation and apoptosis on CLENDO cell survival cells were pretreated with control media or GSH 10 mM for 30 min and then treated with or without TNF 50 ng ml for 48 h For Western blot analysis CLENDO cells were treated with TNF 50 ng ml or C2 ceramide for 0 2 5 10 30 or 60 min Cell lysates were collected and assayed for active MAPK family members as described below For measurements of ceramide content in response to TNF 50 ng ml treatment pre equilibrated cells were treated with TNF 50 ng ml for 0 2 5 10 or 30 min and lipids were extracted as described below Parameters of apoptosis To identify apoptosis inducing agents in CLENDO cells culture medium was removed following treatments cells were washed one time with ice cold PBS and fixed for 10 min with 4 paraformaldehyde The cells were rinsed one time with PBS and nuclei stained by placing 200 l glycerol 80 in 1X PBS containing 2 g ml Hoechst 33258 in each well While pyknotic nuclei were visible in adherent cells in response to some treatments we also observed a large number of dead floating cells as confirmed by trypan blue staining Thus the average number of non apoptotic cells in 10 fields was determined and presented as raw values Biochemical analyses were employed to verify whether or not cell loss was the result of apoptosis Oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation was used as a biochemical marker of endothelial cell apoptosis in which cells were untreated for 48 h treated with TNF 50 ng ml for 12 24 or 48 or treated with C2 ceramide 50 M for 12 h Cells were scraped and separated from culture medium by centrifugation 1200 rpm 10 min 4 C and DNA was isolated as described 37 Following electrophoresis fragmented DNA 5 g was visualized by ethidium bromide staining To provide a second source of biochemical evidence that TNF induced apoptosis confluent cultures of CLENDO cells were incubated with a fluorogenic substrate which detects caspase 3 activity 10 M DEVD sequence Phi Phi Lux OncoImmunin Inc College Park MD at 2 and 8 h after TNF treatment for 30 min These times were selected since no visible morphological signs chromatin condensation or formation of apoptotic bodies of apoptosis were evident until after 12 h Following the incubation cells were rinsed 3 times with medium and analyzed by fluorescent microscopy as described 26 38 Western blot analysis Protein lysates were collected for Western blot analysis as described elsewhere 17 35 39 Briefly following separation by SDS PAGE the proteins 20 g lane were transferred 100 V 1 h to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5 fat free milk in TBST 50 mM Tris HCL pH7 5 0 15 NaCl 0 05 Tween 20 1 h at room temperature Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies to various MAPK family members overnight at 4 C phospho ERK 1 5000 Promega Madison WI phospho p38 1 1000 New England Biolabs Beverly MA phospho JNK 1 500 Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc Santa Cruz CA Previous studies have demonstrated that these antibodies recognize the phosphorylated active forms of extracellular regulated kinase ERK p38 and Jun N terminal kinase JNK Membranes were then washed 3 5 min each with TBST buffer and incubated with anti rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate or anti mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate 1 2000 Santa Cruz Biotechnology Santa Cruz CA for 1 h at room temperature The membranes were washed with TBST as before and the bound antibody was detected using ECL reagents based on the manufacturer s recommendations Amersham Piscataway NJ X ray films were scanned and band intensity was determined using a Kodak 1D software package Since pJNK pERK and panERK appear in two isoforms both bands were scanned together To verify equal protein loading membranes were then stripped and re probed with the panERK antibody 1 1000 Transduction Laboratories Lexington KY which recognizes the constitutively expressed ERKs in bovine CLENDO cells as previously described 35 Evaluation of ceramide production in response to TNF The amount of ceramide generated by CLENDO cells in response to TNF treatment 50 ng ml was determined in three independent sets of experiments via the diacyl glycerol kinase assay as described 26 40 Each experiment contained an untreated control that was used for comparison with TNF treated samples Briefly membrane lipids were extracted 1 ml methanol 10 min at 80 C from endothelial cells immediately following treatment and dried under nitrogen gas Lipids were subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis and dried under nitrogen gas Ceramide in the lipid extracts were labeled with 32P ATP and the resulting products resolved using thin layer chromatography Graded levels of commercially purified ceramides were employed as a standard curve The band in each lane corresponding to ceramide 1 phosphate was cut from the chromatography plate and counted in a scintillation counter Changes in ceramide production in response to TNF treatment were presented as a percentage of the untreated control value Statistics Assignment to treatments was made at random Raw data were subjected to least squares analysis of variance followed by Duncan s new multiple range test or the Student t tests for paired comparisons The results were expressed as the mean SEM and a value of P 0 05 was considered significant Results TNF reduces viability of CLENDO cells To determine which cytokines initiate apoptosis in CLENDO cells we treated the cells for 48 h with TNF IFN or the combination of the two TNF treatment resulted in a significant reduction in CLENDO cell viability 34 P 0 05 which was reduced P 0 05 an additional 23 by co treatment with IFN Fig 1a Treatment with IFN alone showed no statistical difference in viability compared with the untreated control during the first 48 h of treatment Although Fas activating antibody Jo2 induces apoptosis in ovarian surface epithelial cells 23 Jo2 had no effect on CLENDO cell survival Similarly treatment of CLENDO cells with the luteolytic agent PGF 2 for 48 h failed to induce apoptosis compared to the untreated control In a second group of experiments we observed that CLENDO cells were resistant to apoptosis when treated for 72 h with sFasL or the human Fas activating antibody CH 11 Interestingly treatment with IFN for 72 h showed a modest increase P 0 05 in cell death compared to the untreated control group Fig 1b Treatment with TNF caused a linear decrease in the number of non apoptotic CLENDO cells starting at 24 h and continuing through 72 h of treatment Fig 2a CLENDO cells treated with TNF for 12 h showed no significant difference in the number of non apoptotic cells compared with the 72 h untreated control However some cells in the 12 h group showed early signs of apoptosis in that pyknosis and partitioning of nuclei were observed not shown To provide biochemical evidence that the form of cell death observed was apoptosis assays for oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and caspase 3 activity were performed Oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation was evident 12 h after TNF treatment and continued through 24 and 48 h Fig 2b Caspase 3 activity cleavage of Phi Phi Lux was easily detected by 8 h after TNF treatment and was evident as early as 2 h Fig 2c Ceramide is generated in response to TNF treatment and kills CLENDO cells Previous studies have shown that TNF like other death receptors stimulates the accumulation of the second messenger ceramide and that this lipid signaling molecule can serve as an upstream activator of cell stress signaling pathways 41 Measurements of total cellular ceramide in CLENDO cells revealed that ceramide levels were significantly elevated P 0 05 as early as 2 min following TNF treatment and remained elevated through 30 min of treatment Fig 3a Treatment of CLENDO cells with an exogenous source of ceramide C2 50 M caused a significant decrease in cell viability starting 24 h after treatment compared to untreated cells cultured for 72 h Fig 3b Treatment of CLENDO cells for 48 h with S1P at either 10 M or 50 M concentrations did not induce CLENDO cell death data not shown Furthermore pretreatment of CLENDO cells for 30 min with S1P did not prevent ceramide or TNF induced apoptosis data not shown As with TNF treatment application of ceramide to CLENDO cells resulted in oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation within 12 h thus confirming apoptosis as the mechanism of cell death see Fig 2b lane 6 Acute activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase superfamily by TNF and ceramide Substantial data support the notion that ceramide serves as an upstream signaling molecule in the activation of other signaling pathways such as the mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK superfamily 33 In the present study quantitative measures were performed on members of the MAPK superfamily using antibodies that recognize only the phosphorylated and presumptively active forms of ERK JNK and p38 Western blot analysis confirmed that all three members of the MAPK superfamily were transiently activated by treatment with TNF Fig 4a The levels of phospho ERKs increased within 5 min of TNF treatment peaked by 10 min and decreased by 30 min Fig 4b Phospho p38 levels peaked at 5 min and showed an equally rapid decline in activity Levels of phospho JNK activity increased P 0 05 by 10 min and remained elevated throughout 30 min of incubation with TNF Fig 4b Since ceramide is linked to MAPK signaling pathways 33 we determined the effect of treatment of CLENDO cells with an exogenous source of ceramide Treatment with 50 M C2 ceramide failed to activate the ERK and p38 MAPK pathways However treatment with C2 ceramide did activate the JNK pathway similar to that observed with TNF treatment Fig 4c Phospho JNK was elevated with in 5 minutes after C2 addition and remained elevated for at least 30 min Glutathione attenuates TNF induced cell death Since TNFRSF induces cell death by causing an efflux of glutathione GSH in other cell types 42 we sought to determine if pretreatment of CLENDO cells with GSH would attenuate lethality associated with TNF treatment CLENDO cells pretreated for 30 min with GSH were significantly less susceptible P 0 05 to the lethal effects of TNF over a 48 h period than cells treated with TNF alone Fig 5 Treatment with GSH alone had no effect on the CLENDO cell viability Discussion Treatment of animals with PGF 2 or its analogs results in endothelial cell death in vivo 43 suggesting that PGF 2 may have a direct effect on CLENDO cells However the microvasculature of the CL is composed of a number of different luteal endothelial cell types the most common of which does not express mRNA encoding the PGF 2 receptor FP 35 44 This particular endothelial cell type is unresponsive to PGF 2 treatment 35 in that PGF 2 treatment does not increase the secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 35 or stimulate well recognized PGF 2 responsive intracellular signaling pathways 35 36 Lehmann et al 45 recently characterized a predominant cytokeratin negative endothelial cell type in the bovine CL in addition to a rare cytokeratin positive endothelial cell type These two cell populations may have different functional capacities in that they differ in their expression of FP 44 45 as well as their secreted cytokine profiles 45 In the present studies PGF 2 was incapable of directly inducing apoptosis of CLENDO cells Consequently there is some question as to whether PGF 2 has any direct effect on CLENDO cell function which directed our attention toward other known luteolytic factors i e cytokines A primary objective of this study was to determine which cytokines initiate CLENDO cell death Of the various cytokines tested TNF IFN or sFasL TNF was the only potent initiator of CLENDO cell death Time course analysis suggested that the loss of viability was rapid Fig 1aand 2a and progressive with only 30 of the cells remaining non apoptotic by 72 hr post treatment The rapid induction of apoptosis in response to TNF is similar to the microvascular endothelial cell death which was observed by Friedman and colleagues 29 at higher concentrations of TNF One receptor for TNF TNF RI is expressed throughout the bovine estrous cycle 46 but is more abundantly expressed by the endothelial cell component than in steroidogenic cells 29 At physiological concentrations TNF induces cell death in most TNF responsive cell types via apoptosis This effect was evident in CLENDO cells by hallmark features of apoptosis including nuclear chromatin condensation formation of apoptotic bodies and it was confirmed by an increase in caspase 3 activity and oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation Active caspase 3 is a functional requirement of spontaneous luteal regression in that caspase 3 deficient mice retain CL for a longer period of time than wild type littermates 47 However this murine study did not delineate which luteal cells were affected Whether caspase 3 activity is a required component of the luteal endothelial cell apoptosis paradigm remains to be determined Unlike TNF other cytokines IFN or sFasL or Fas activating antibodies had little effect on the endothelial cell viability It is not readily apparent why these cytokines failed to induce CLENDO cell death but one explanation may be the lack of cognate receptors on the cell surface Co treatment of luteal endothelial cells with IFN augmented TNF induced death a result that may be explained in two ways First it is possible that the signaling events initiated by the combined treatment of TNF and IFN are more potent at activating endothelial cell death than TNF alone Alternatively IFN may increase the expression of the death domain containing TNF RI and thus increase the luteal endothelial cell death susceptibility upon exposure to TNF This later suggestion has been shown to be the case in luteal steroidogenic cells for another death receptor in which Fas mRNA expression increased in response to IFN treatment 20 22 Interestingly we find that two different cytokines i e sFasL and TNF can activate the sphingomyelin pathway in two distinct CL cell types TNF elevates ceramide in CLENDO cells whereas sFasL elevates ceramide in primary luteal steroidogenic cells 26 Ceramide treatment induces apoptosis in both cell types suggesting that the sphingomyelin pathway may be a common mediator of cell death among distinct cell types within the CL Sphingomyelin content and luteal cell membrane fluidity decrease during luteolysis in vivo 48 49 50 51 Ceramide a product of sphingomyelin hydrolysis is a potent stress activated second messenger and is well established as a functional component of death receptor mediated apoptosis 52 53 54 Upon treatment of CLENDO cells with TNF we observed a rapid and sustained increase in the production of ceramide suggesting that the sphingomyelin pathway is present and active in these cells Exogenous ceramide induced CLENDO cell oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and reduced cell viability in a manner consistent with TNF treatment The exact role and functional significance of ceramide production in response to TNF in CLENDO cell apoptosis are not presently known However in some cell types ceramide production has been placed at the top of molecular ordering schemes for several signaling cascades as well as increase in reactive oxygen species Substantial evidence exists to suggest that stress induced apoptosis is mediated through activation of MAPK signaling pathways in non ovarian cell types While these pathways are activated in luteal steroidogenic cells by diverse cell stressors including cytokines 55 no such detailed studies have been completed to date in the endothelial cell component of the CL In the present study we provide evidence that TNF and a by product of TNF signaling ceramide both have the capacity to activate members of the MAPK family Activation of MAPK stress pathways can alter cell viability through multiple mechanisms For example TNF can activate transcription factors that bind genomic DNA and initiate gene expression of pro apoptotic genes 56 57 A number of studies provide evidence that the luteolytic process may involve a rapid and sustained increase in ROS 58 59 Other studies demonstrate that luteal regression is associated with a dramatic decrease in the mRNAs encoding enzymes responsible for regulating the intracellular redox state 60 Death induced by TNF is also reportedly mediated by an increase in ROS an event correlated with a marked decrease in the vital intracellular ROS scavenger GSH Activation of TNF RI and other death domain containing receptors of the TNF receptor superfamily have been shown to cause an efflux of GSH which contributes to the apoptotic process 42 61 Provision of GSH in the present study reduced the deleterious effects of TNF on CLENDO cells We suggest that one mechanism by which TNF induces CLENDO cell death is through the formation of ROS a result that may stem from depletion of GSH stores in CLENDO cells Provision of exogenous GSH may restore the redox state disrupted by TNF treatment These findings lend support to the notion that TNF contributes to luteolysis by initiating formation of endothelial cell derived ROS In this study we have corroborated findings of Friedman et al 29 that TNF is a potent apoptotic stimulus of primary luteal microvascular endothelial cells and extend these findings by characterizing the activation of several stress activated signal transduction pathways in response to TNF treatment of cultured endothelial cells Whether these acute signaling events are linked to and functionally required for down stream apoptotic mechanisms remain to be determined Furthermore the possibility that alterations in GSH metabolism or cellular flux and thus the redox state within CLENDOs result from exposure to TNF needs to be tested These experiments as well as future studies designed to identify the enzymatic pathway s and in which cellular compartment s ceramide is generated in luteal microvascular endothelial cells in response to TNF treatment should help determine which if any of the acutely activated signal transduction pathways contribute to luteal endothelial cell apoptosis In conclusion TNF activates several stress activated signaling pathways that may facilitate GSH efflux and thus increase ROS and subsequent cell death
