 Fish n Chips Katha No I m in favor of abolishing the British National Health Service altogether and letting the market take care of most people s healthcare and the government coming in to rescue those who fall through the cracks This would probably lead I d guess to more social spending on health care as a percentage of GNP and would more accurately reflect people s real balance of needs and wants What it would avoid is the impossible politicization of health care In Britain you regularly have parliamentary debates in which some limit is imposed on health care spending and some huffy back bencher once Labour now Tory demands why the minister for health just murdered his grandmother It s an impossible position to put politicians in and brings out their worst instincts of pandering emotionalism and over spending Yes yes I know because of insurance and third parties there is no true market for healthcare but we should try to approximate one as best we can so that people s real desires and not some political hack s view of them determine the structure of healthcare And yes health is not a good like say computers and the state should step in and help those who really can t help themselves but as a last resort As for AIDS the new treatments mainly pioneered in the US by big drug companies trying to make profits not do good are far cheaper than the alternative of doing nothing and so economics should and will guarantee that most people who need them and can take them responsibly should get them The notion that large numbers of people who need the meds can t get them is I think overstated Some of the biggest drops in death rates have been among the poor and racial minorities But do some people fall through the cracks Yes Should we do all we can to find them and help them Yes But can state of the art treatment of every illness be guaranteed to every citizen Not in a universe of limited funding which is the universe we live in But without the US freeish market health system there would be far less effective treatments to give people in the first place As to Japan I don t think our cultural differences are merely related to media distortion Lots of people I know who have lived there concur It sounds like a living hell And the only way I have ever enjoyed eating fish is deep fried in batter wrapped in newsprint And lots of vinegar best Andrew
