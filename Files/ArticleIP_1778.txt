Wednesday morning click here And if you missed the most recent installments of this column here they are posted Tuesday Sept 22 and Friday Sept 18 A Yugoslav paper claims to have talked to Monica Lewinsky on the telephone According to a report from Belgrade Thursday in La Stampa of Turin the weekly Nedjeljni Telegraf got in touch with Monica s mother Marcia Lewis through an ex hairdresser of hers Bozdimir Bulent a Yugoslav immigrant living in Washington D C The paper called from Belgrade continually for a week before Lewis finally allowed it to talk to her daughter The clinching factor La Stampa said was the mention of a mysterious Yugoslav by the name of Dusko with whom Lewis had allegedly fallen in love 20 years ago in Los Angeles Softened by thoughts of Dusko she gave in and arranged for Nedjeljni Telegraf to call Monica direct This is how the interview reportedly went Answering the phone in a rather hoarse and velvety voice Monica said I was expecting your call My mother mentioned it I sincerely hope you won t make bad use of it Asked if she had ever imagined she might be the talk of the whole world she replied Not even in my dreams and I m not at all happy about it Did she love the president Perhaps but now it s of no importance Did she feel exploited In a certain sense yes I never expected all this Would money and fame change her life I don t think about such things Money has never been important to me Monica said she now spends most of her time on the telephone and almost never watches television Asked if she had a message for the readers of the Nedjeljni Telegraf she said They shouldn t believe everything they read in the papers But when the weekly asked if during her meetings with President Clinton he had ever mentioned Serbia Monica decided she had had enough and put down the phone La Stampa failed to vouch for the authenticity of this interview In the continuing flood of international press comment on the White House scandal there is very little favorable to Kenneth Starr But Nigeria s independent Post Express said in an editorial Wednesday The fact that Monica Lewinsky a mere intern could be protected by the State against such a mighty opponent as the most powerful politician in the world reveals the beauty and the costliness of democracy It is significant to note that even at the possible cost of the presidency the right to fair hearing and enabling unconcealed information to the citizenry sic have been remarkably upheld in this case It is best imagined what would have happened to Lewinsky her family and any enthusiastic reporting press of this scandalous episode in any undemocratic society In Canada the Toronto Globe and Mail said in an editorial Thursday that it is time for America s pundits pollsters and prognosticators to take a vacation because i f Americans are tired of hearing about President Bill Clinton s sexual life they are doubtlessly doubly weary of hearing experts tell them how they feel about the whole thing The theme of the editorial was the distinction that should be made between feelings and deeds The endless mood monitoring of the people and their president has revealed a swirl of conflicting feelings but the end product is the s ame as it was when the whole thing started Mr Clinton remains the President and the citizens remain guardedly content to keep him there Americans may be experiencing all kinds of feelings about their President but they are remarkably consistent when they are asked what they want to do about those emotions the Globe and Mail went on Impeachment No a majority of the US public has answered from the start to the finish of this story It is the ability of the American public to distinguish between feelings and deeds that will save Clinton it said They show no interest in punishing him for his private feelings but a clear desire to see him pay a limited price for his deeds Americans have clearly stated that feelings aren t the issue here Sooner or later the pollsters and the pundits will understand that too In South Africa the Johannesburg Star ran a eulogistic editorial Thursday about President Nelson Mandela s visit to the United States He fired the pride of African Americans and touched a deep desire in the psyche of Americans both black and white for a leader who might rekindle the bi racial coalition that destroyed their country s own version of apartheid in the 1960s the racism they are still fighting to eradicate today and the never ending scandals Mandela may lack the rousing American oratory of a President Kennedy Martin Luther King or Jesse Jackson but his manner and his unflappable dignity show him as a disciplined persistent leader who is willing to sacrifice short term gratification for long term achievement the kind of moral leadership we need everywhere A real untarnished hero in a time of flawed public figures such as Clinton
