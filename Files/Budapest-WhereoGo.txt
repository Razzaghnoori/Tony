 WhERE TO GO T he grey green Danube cuts straight through the heart of the city neatly separating the ancient cobblestone streets of Buda from the late 19th century boulevards of Pest If you love history you ll probably head for the Buda side of the river but if you re a keen shopper and enjoy lively nightlife then Pest will certainly oblige Orientation is rarely a problem as the majority of sights are crammed into the central areas and getting around the city is very easy Castle Hill is made for walking and the rest of town is ef ciently served by buses trams trolleybuses and underground trains This section follows the natural layout of the city starting on the western bank with Buda Obuda and the hills and then moves across the Danube stopping at Margaret Island and over to Pest on the opposite side of the river It is perhaps best to sample Budapest piecemeal taking a little from one side then crossing over the river to the other and heading back again However most would agree that the best place to start is the Castle Hill Castle Hill Varhegy This fascinating area is the most picturesque and peaceful spot in Budapest giving the only clue as to how the medieval city once looked Entire streets of beautiful old buildings are concentrated here and almost every other house bears a mueml k monument plaque which tells of its history As serene as it seems today however the district has suffered destruction upon destruction in the past and many places have been rebuilt at least once The area overlooks the city from a long narrow plateau divided into two the southern part occupied by the enormous Royal Palace where the original castle once stood and the northern district of historic streets where 14th and 15th century aristocrats and artisans once rubbed shoulders From Pest there are various ways of getting up to Castle Hill The most popular method of ascent is aboard the 19th century sikl funicular which starts by the end of the Chain Bridge and rises to the Royal Palace Alternatively take the metro to Moszkva t r climb up the steps to the road and catch the mini V rbusz service which shuttles to and from D sz t r stopping at numerous points en route You could simply walk up the hill using any one of several streets and staircases but one method you cannot use is your own transport cars are forbidden on the hill unless you are a resident or a guest at the Hilton Hotel thus preserving the area s historic ambience Historic Streets Turning right at the funicular terminus a short walk brings you to D sz t r Parade Square which marks the start of the northern district The M ty s templom Matthias Church spire towering gracefully over this historic area is the best reference point for our tour The church takes its name from Hungary s favourite medieval king who married here twice in the 15th century The Emperor Franz Joseph I was crowned king of Hungary here in 1867 to the tune of the Coronation Mass composed by Liszt for the occasion The original church was built in the mid 13th century converted into a mosque during the Turkish occupation and seriously damaged during Buda s recapture in 1686 It was rebuilt in Baroque style after the return of the Christian forces and between 1873 and 1896 it was completely reconstructed along its present Neo Gothic lines The unusual multi coloured diamond pattern roof and geometric designs covering the inside walls date back to the 19th century refurbishing the motifs are therefore Hungarian and not Turkish Tour guides are quick to point out the Loreto Chapel immediately to the left of the entrance where a red marble statue of the Virgin takes pride of place At the east end of the church is the entrance to the crypt and the museum which holds a ne collection of medieval stone carvings sacred relics historic vestments and religious paintings The museum rambles up and down old staircases around the church offering at one spot an excellent view down onto the nave Outside the front of the church in the centre of Szent h roms g t r Trinity Square is a votive column crowded with statues of saints and angels which recalls a bubonic plague epidemic of the early 18th century The survivors built the monument in gratitude for being spared Behind the column there is a ne Neo Gothic building that puts on temporary exhibitions and also offers accommodation Looking across the square towards D sz t r the Baroque two storey white building with a jutting corner balcony served as the former Buda town hall from 1710 to 1873 Behind the church is the most photographed monument in Budapest the intriguingly named Hal szb stya Fishermen s Bastion Built onto the castle walls at rst glance this picture book array of turrets terraces and arches could easily pass for authentic medieval forti cations but they are in fact too good to be true constructed around the turn of this century as pure ornamentation The name refers to the shermen who defended the ramparts here in the 18th century Today it is a busy place with coachloads of tourists peering through the arches for one of the city s finest views across the Danube and over to the Houses of Parliament At the handsome equestrian statue of the canonized King Istv nn old ladies trade Transylvanian tablecloths zithers sing sweetly and barrel organs grind while classical buskers ll the air with Bart k and Liszt The view west from Fishermen s Bastion focuses on the startling six storey re ective fa ade of the Budapest Hilton Hotel The bold approach of shamelessly merging ancient and modern has integrated the 1977 Hilton Hotel with the remains of a 17th century Jesuit college and the tower of the district s oldest church dating from the 13th century Across on Hess Andr s t r the bas relief of a red hedgehog at number 3 recalls the 18th century when the building was an inn of that name Today on the hill there s no better place for light refreshment than Ruszwurm s a mere scone s throw away at 7 Szenth roms g utca This cosy patisserie has been resident here since 1827 its cakes compete favourably with the best the city has to offer Start your tour of the old streets along T ncsics Mih ly utca House number 7 where Beethoven stayed in 1800 is now the charming Museum of the History of Music Here you ll learn to tell your clavichord from your hurdy gurdy and that bagpipes are also an Hungarian instrument Next door at number 9 are plaques to political heroes Mih ly T ncsics and Lajos Kossuth both imprisoned here in the 1830s and 1840s for their nationalist beliefs Number 26 served as a synagogue from the end of the 14th century a small museum relates to this period The street ends at the B csi kapu Vienna Gate a reminder that the district was once fully enclosed The grand building next to the gate with the diamond patterned roof echoing that of St M ty s is the National Archive open to the public Fortuna utca is a charming much photographed street full of pastel painted houses and takes its name from a tavern which stood at number 4 from 1785 to 1868 Today this houses the Museum of Commerce and Catering Kereskedelmi s Vend gl t ipari M zeum nowhere near as grand nor as boring as its name suggests dealing with confectionery in one section and Hungarian trade in the late 19th and early 20th century in another The museum curators take a genuine delight in demonstrating various exhibits it s well worth a visit At Szenth roms g t r turn back into Orsz gh z utca Orsz gh z which means Houses of Parliament takes its name from the parliamentary sessions which took place in the building at number 28 between 1790 and 1807 The architectural highlights of this street however are the grand 15th century mansion now used by the Alab rdos halbardier restaurant as well as numbers 18 22 which are considered three of the nest examples of 14th and 15th century domestic architecture on the hill Several other buildings on this street incorporate picturesque medieval features at times hidden just inside the archway Here you ll see both ancient stone sedilia built in seats for three people and vignettes of contemporary life with an equally timeless quality such as necklaces of paprika strung across windows and balconies to dry people do still live here At the end of this street rises a large glassless church window It belongs to the Church of Mary Magdalene reduced to knee high remains by the Allies in the last days of World War II Amazingly its huge rocket like 15th century tower survived and now houses a private art gallery The stone window was rebuilt but the remainder of the church was left levelled as a poignant reminder of events An altogether more light hearted curiosity can be seen on the corner of Orsz gh z utca and Petermann b r utca A ying nun in stone a reference to a convent that occupied number 28 before Parliament has apparently passed straight through the corner of the building Mikl s Melocco executed this amusing sculpture in 1977 Uri utca meaning gentlemen s street is even older than Orsz gh z utca and the details on many of its houses are equally fascinating Yet another specialist museum crops up at number 49 the Telephone Museum features 110 years of telephone exchanges and technology Budapest had the first telephone exchange At number 9 you can descend deep into the hill via a series of tunnels that were dug in medieval times as an escape route in times of siege They were used again as air raid shelters and an emergency hospital in 1944 1945 Here visitors can join a guided tour of the caves and tunnels which also contain a waxwork exhibition depicting episodes of Hungarian history Uri utca terminates at D sz t r where it s best to turn and walk back along T rnok utca Among the shops and restaurants here are a number of ne buildings The orange and red geometric frescoes painted on the overhanging rst oor of the Aranyhord Golden Barrel restaurant are the most noteworthy Next door number 18 was built as a merchant s house in the rst half of the 15th century Used as the Arany Sas Golden Eagle pharmacy from 1750 until 1913 it is now the most attractive of this area s small museums Beautiful old majolica vessels are the stars of an atmospheric re creation of the pharmacy and there are also informative displays on potions practices and alchemy in the Budapest of this era The nal street of this district to be explored is the leafy T th Arp d s t ny This promenade situated along the western ramparts offers views of the Buda Hills and the huge Southern Railway Station D li p lyaudavar rather than a glorious Danube panorama Nonetheless this is a delightful stroll particularly in early evening when the locals come out to enjoy the fresh air At the northern end various cannon signal the entrance to the Museum of Military History Hadt rt neti M zeum It s an extensive exhibition and popular with school children but the section dedicated to the 1956 uprising is the most memorable for older visitors The Royal Palace Now returned to its former outward splendour the Royal Palace dominates Castle Hill s southern skyline Construction began in the 13th century and reached its zenith in the 15th century under King M ty s when the palace was said to be equal in grandeur to that of any in Europe Under the Ottoman empire however it was neglected and during the siege of 1686 was destroyed In the following two centuries the palace was rebuilt in the Neo Baroque style Nemesis was on hand again when the German occupation forces made this their headquarters during a nal stand in 1945 Since then the palace has been rebuilt purely to house three museums and a library It s a huge place and can t be covered in one day Break up your time here with sightseeing on the northern part of the hill If you are not already on Castle Hill then the best approach to the Royal Palace is from the steps at the southern tip of the hill by the Semmelweis Medical Museum The path winds up through lovely gardens to the rear entrance of the castle and the only surviving turreted tower the Buzog ny mace Tower Steps lead up through tiny castle gardens to the entrance of the Museum of Budapest History Budapesti T rt neti M zeum in wing E of the Royal Palace More than 40 years of excavations at the palace site have produced a picture of the medieval Royal Palace of King M ty s it is possible to visit the ten or so rooms that have survived from the original now reconstructed in their former state Make sure you see the exhibition of Gothic statues from the Royal Palace During construction work at the start of the 15th century the statues were thrown out in the yard which was later filled in and they remained there until excavated in 1974 The southern palace courtyard includes wing F which houses the National Library and its two million books The library is open to the public and temporary exhibitions are held in the building Through the courtyard arch is the main Palace area The Museum of Recent History in Wing A stages some interesting everyday life exhibitions visitors can also enjoy views of Buda and Pest Wings B C and D house the Hungarian National Gallery Magyar Nemzeti Gal ria a huge undertaking spanning seven centuries of Hungarian art Don t try to see it all in one visit there are some ne works here but it is too much for one day The gallery s most popular sections are Hungarian Impressionism and 20th century works in Wings C and D Contemporary art lovers are advised to head straight for the Ludwig Collection in wing A which includes important figures in the contemporary art world featuring several controversial works Obuda Historically Obuda is the oldest quarter of Buda centred on the site of Aquincum the capital of the Roman province of Lower Pannonia Nowadays it s a nightmare of Soviet town planning with heavy traf c constantly rumbling past on the main northern highway out of Budapest Amid this unlikely setting however there are some major Roman remains to be discovered To begin the Roman route take any number of city buses north to the so called Military Amphitheatre Katonai Am te trum thus distinguishing it from a smaller one a short distance farther north Gladiators performed here in the second century to amuse legionnaires Completely forgotten for centuries the ruins were only partially restored in the 1930s Now it s effectively a grassy piece of parkland where locals play and walk their dogs but enough remains of the amphitheatre walls and outline to give a good idea of what it was once like Farther north beneath the Fl ri n t r yover on the Buda side of the Arp d Bridge stand the ruins of baths built for the Roman legions Take the walkway on the opposite side of the yover from the baths and you will catch the incongruous sight of a dozen isolated Corinthian columns with a 1960s housing estate backdrop The third and most important site is that of Aquincum a civil town for the artisans merchants priests and other non military staff attached to the legion You can get here by bus tram or HEV train Keep your eyes on the highway central reservation shortly before the Aquincum stop and you will see the remains of a Roman aqueduct The site proper which covers several acres comprises the foundations of villas including some oor mosaics workshops and public areas and there is another amphitheatre ruin on the other side of the road You will need more than a little imagination to re enact the scene of 1 600 1 700 years ago from the knee high rubble but you will nd help in the small museum attached to the site Here the best of the nds are displayed here and at the entrance kiosk there are guide books in various languages If you want to explore the Roman connection farther enquire at Aquincum about access to the Hercules Villa museum at Meggyfa utca 21 But there is more to Obuda than its Roman heritage Between Fl ri n t r and the river is Fot r a small picturesque cobbled square untouched by modern development In this oasis you will nd a fine old theatre several pleasant caf s four rst class restaurants and just off the square two excellent small museum galleries Even before you reach the Imre Varga Museum at Laktanya utca 7 you ll half know what to expect because of the charming gures with umbrellas standing by the square Varga is renowned as Hungary s greatest living sculptor whether his materials and subject matter are conventional as is the case with Umbrellas or offbeat as many of his works are he manages to be accessible and very likeable The Vasarely Museum on Szentl lek t r features rst class Op Art a style that exploits optical effects characterized by cubes and spheres in bright eye popping checker board colours by artist Victor Vasarely a pioneer of the movement Buda Riverside and Hills The stretch of riverside which is of most interest to visitors runs north from Szabads g h d Liberty Bridge While Castle Hill provides arguably the nest views over the Danube there is another lookout point that also should not be missed Gell rt hegy Gell rt Hill which rises some 140 metres 430 feet almost directly above the Danube on the Buda side provides a marvellous panorama It s not well served by public transport so give your legs some exercise starting from the southern approach by the Gell rt Hotel Almost immediately to your right you will see an extraordinary monument in the hillside a cave converted into a chapel It belongs to the Order of St Paul the only monastic body of Hungarian origin Continue up the slope through the pleasant landscaped gardens of the Jubileumi Park turn right onto the main road and you will soon reach the summit The Citadel crowning the hill was built by the Habsburgs after the Revolution of 1848 as a lookout point from which to control neighbouring Castle Hill It saw no action however until the end of World War II when the German army held out here Since then the Citadel has been renovated and now holds a restaurant caf and budget hotel A Liberation Monument Szabadsag szobor visible from all parts of the city stands below the citadel It was erected by the Russians in honour of their troops who fell while liberating Budapest from the Germans The monument is loathed by most locals as a symbol of Soviet domination but it has become too much of a city landmark to remove Down at the base of the hill the Gell rt Hotel is the perfect place to recover from your walk Behind this classic 1918 white Art Nouveau structure is a swimming pool complex and the nest thermal bath in Buda While the older family members may wish to enjoy the restorative thermal waters and float at leisure in the beautiful indoor pool youngsters will most likely delight in the equally splendid landscaped outdoor pool There are some more baths f rdo with a wonderful atmosphere in which to relax just along the Buda embankment rakpart by the entrance to the Erzs bet h d Elizabeth Bridge The thermal pools are restricted to men only The entrance to the Rudas f rdo is rather shabby and a knowledge of the language is de nitely an advantage here but after 400 years of serving the locals change comes slowly The building has been much altered over the centuries but the atmosphere in the steamy main pool where a stone Turkish dome rises over an octagonal pool and sunbeams stream in through the star shaped glass openings in the cupola is magically ancient The medicinal theme continues a little farther north at the Semmelweis Museum of the History of Medicine Semmelweis Orvost rt neti M zeum Professor Semmelweis who was born here in 1815 discovered the cause of puerperal fever and thus became known as the Saviour of Mothers The museum is a lively sometimes gruesome trawl through old instruments and techniques some of which appear far worse than the condition they were intended to relieve There is also a beautifully preserved old pharmacy shop dating back to 1813 North of the museum the embankment is relieved by arcades terraces Neo Classical statues ceremonial staircases and gateways not open to the public which lead up to the Royal Palace At this point it s best to catch a bus or tram along the main road Fo utca which becomes a canyon of traf c noise pollution and exhaust fumes Get off at the stop before Batthy ny t r to admire the colourful exterior of the 1896 Neo Gothic Calvinist Church which features in so many panoramas of the city Batthy ny t r is a major square where metro bus tram and suburban railway all meet It is a bright lively area and offers a wonderful view of the Houses of Parliament directly across the river The similarity to London s own Parliament Big Ben aside is quite striking with the Danube simply substituted for the Thames The Vienna stagecoach terminal used to be just around the corner and the once famous White Cross Inn on the opposite side of the square to the river was the fashionable venue for balls and festivities It s still a grand old building even if its role has now diminished to that of a nightclub renamed Casanova after the famous rake who reputedly stayed here On the south side of the square is Szent Anna templom St Anne s Church a ne mid 18th century structure with Italianate in uences Farther north along Fo utca is another excellent example of a Turkish bath The Kir ly f rdo Kir ly Baths were established in the 16th century and the authentic Turkish section has survived complete with an octagonal pool under the largest dome Apart from the steam bath visitors can use the bath tubs sauna and several other facilities Turn left off Frakel Le t the continuation of Fo utca at Margit h d Margaret Bridge and follow the signpost up the steps to another Turkish memento the G l Baba t rb je the tomb of G l Baba This meticulously preserved mausoleum was built in the mid 16th century for G l Baba a famous dervish killed during the siege of Buda in 1541 whose funeral was attended by the Sultan The interior in keeping with the Muslim tradition is quite simple with the tomb surrounded by carpets and a few artworks from the Turkish government The hill on which the tomb stands called the R zsadomb Hill of the Roses is one of the most exclusive addresses in Budapest Buda Hills The Buda Hills area is a greenbelt that lies due west of R zsadomb though it stretches as far north as Obuda and as far south as the start of the M7 highway Choose a clear day then catch any one of several trams or buses which go past the cog railway terminus just west of Moszkva t r opposite the Hotel Budapest There is room on the train for mountain bikes if you are feeling particularly active The train passes smart residential houses on its way to the terminus and park of Sv b hegy A short walk across the park just follow the crowds is the stop for the Children s Railway Sz chenyi hegyi Gyermekvas t thus named because it is operated almost entirely by school children only the engine drivers are adults This is an old narrow gauge line which traverses seemingly unspoiled forests but for the numerous walking trails and climbs slowly ever upwards At the rst stop Normafa you ll find a ski run but unless it s snowing stay on the train until J nos hegy It is a 10 15 minute walk from here to the J nos hegy lookout tower at 529 metres 1 735 feet the highest point in the city If the horizon is not blurred by mist there s a splendid 360 degree view for mile upon mile you can also eat here On the way to the lookout tower you will have passed a chair lift that goes down to a camping site The views from the chair lift are also spectacular and the peace and quiet as you soar up and down the mountainside is quite extraordinary Remember to note that the chairlift is closed on some Mondays check with Tourinform or go on another day If you would prefer a speedy return to town catch the 158 bus to Moszkva t r from near the bottom of the chair lift Between the Banks Just as Tower Bridge is the toast of London the Golden Gate is the pride of San Francisco and the Brooklyn Bridge is a symbol of New York Budapest too has its landmark river crossings The most venerable of these is the Sz chenyi L nch d or Chain Bridge opened in 1849 the rst span to unite Buda and Pest Count Istv n Sz chenyi a great innovator of his age imported the technology and expertise of the British Industrial Revolution to help Hungary s own reform programme The bridge was designed by an English engineer William Tierney Clark and its construction was supervised by a Scotsman Adam Clark no relation who has a square named after him at the Buda end of the bridge Don t miss the oodlit view of the bridge it s one of the city s nest sights South of the Chain Bridge is the rather more functional looking Erzs bet h d Elizabeth Bridge named after the consort of Franz Joseph tragically assassinated in 1898 The bridge opened in 1964 is of modern design and works on the suspension principle Southwards from Elizabeth Bridge is the Szabads g h d Liberty Bridge opened in 1896 and originally called the Franz Joseph Bridge It s a handsome green iron structure with turul birds see page 17 perched on a golden ball balancing on each pillar To the north of the Chain Bridge is Margit h d Margaret Bridge a modern replacement of the 19th century version destroyed in World War II Note the fine stone carvings of nymphs resembling ship s gureheads on the bridge piers Margaret Island Margit sziget The elite of the Roman empire escaped everyday cares on this leafy oasis between the two banks and in later eras princes and plutocrats did likewise Today wealthy tourists enjoy the thermal facilities and treatments offered at the two international class hotels on the island The leisure establishment of most interest to visitors is the huge outdoor Palatinus Baths Palatinus strand which includes thermal pools and boasts a capacity of 20 000 swimmers and sunbathers The island is not just for tourists however Budapestis of all ages come here to walk run swim play tennis or team games or simply sunbathe It s also a famous spot for courting couples The island is 2 km 11 2 miles long and only a few hundred yards at the widest part Many of its estimated population of 10 000 trees are now more than a century old and large areas of the island are lawned and landscaped Best of all cars with a few exceptions are prohibited thus preserving the island s peace and quiet Alongside a landmark water tower is a good open air theatre which presents concerts opera and ballet performances in the summer Nearby are the ruins of a 13th century Dominican Convent that was founded by King B la IV Here he enrolled his 11 year old daughter Margit in ful lment of a vow he had made should he live to survive the Mongol invasion Princess and later saint Margit stayed on the island for the rest of her life it was subsequently named after her Her burial place is marked by a marble plaque The other ruins close by include a Franciscan Church and monastery built in the 13th century The charming little Premonstratensian Chapel a 20th century reconstruction of the original 12th century church is still in use today It houses a 15th century bell the oldest in Hungary Pest The bulk of modern Budapest lies to the east of the Danube in what was until 1873 the autonomous city of Pest Here is the true pulse of Budapest large hotels museums government buildings shopping streets nightlife and thunderously busy boulevards From the Romans point of view defending Buda and therefore western civilization was a real headache All they could do was stare across the great expanse of at badlands to the east of the river and wait for the barbarians to arrive So in a d 294 they decided to build a defence on the east side to make it harder for any invaders to establish a foothold here They called the place Contra Aquincum it is still at the core of the inner city of Pest The Inner City Belv ros A medieval town grew around the Roman defence post evolving into a long narrow strip with the Danube to the west and defensive walls on the other sides The so called Kis k r t Little Boulevard follows the line of the old walls and encloses the district of Belv ros Note that you won t nd Kis k r t on any map it s the aggregate of V mh z k r t M zeum k r t K roly k r t the southern end of Baj csy Zsilinszky t and J zsef Attila utca The oldest building in Pest is the Belv rosi templom Inner City Parish Church The exterior is rather unprepossessing a sooty Baroque church hemmed into an undigni ed position by the Elizabeth Bridge but look inside and you can discern much earlier elements in the handsome interior It was founded in the 12th century and some Romanesque construction is still visible So too is the influence of the Turks who turned the church into a mosque and carved a mihrab prayer niche on the Mecca side of the chancel wall Next to the church is all that remains of Contra Aquincum an excavated square with benches and a small display of tablets and reliefs found on the site The centrepiece of Pest s pedestrian zone is V ci utca pronounced Vah tsee utsa the first place to visit for shopping in the city Here you will nd the best fashion art cosmetics books and jewellery the biggest and the best branch of Folkart see page 78 the Pest Sz nh z theatre where Franz Liszt made his city debut as a 12 year old pianist various airline offices and several international organizations V ci utca runs into the ever busy yet somehow relaxed V r smarty t r This is one of Pest s favourite gathering places often lined with craft stalls and resounding to a brass band After a browse through Luxus department store it s probably time for coffee and cakes at Gerbeaud doyen of Budapest s coffee house scene since 1884 If the sumptuous high ceilinged interior is a little too formal for your liking then take a terrace seat and watch the world go by Stroll a few yards towards the river and you will come to yet another pleasant and lively square Vigad t r which has the advantage of a riverside location with Castle Hill views Here too you will find craft stalls and any number of buskers A vibrant caf restaurant comprises one side of the square but the dominant building is the splendid Vigad theatre The interior hall is an acoustically perfect auditorium renovated in 1980 its predecessors having twice perished in war and revolution but the fa ade has been gloriously restored in mid 19th century Hungarian Eastern style The list of performers and conductors who have graced the Vigad theatre is an impressive Who s Who of the past 150 years of European classical music Liszt Brahms Wagner Mahler Bart k Proko ev Casals Bj rling and von Karajan This is also the centre of what may be called the Hotel Zone with four luxury hotels within a very short distance of each other Their architecture has done nothing for the aesthetics of the embankment viewed from the Buda side of the river but ironically looking in the opposite direction they provide some of the nest views of the city From V r smarty t r take De k Ferenc utca into busy De k t r Just to the east of the pedestrianized zone across Peto S ndor utca are a number of intriguing buildings and two small museums Next to the ordinary Lutheran Church is the National Lutheran Museum which houses a valuable collection including documents bibles and chalices It chronicles the story of some of the distinguished Protestants influential in the history of this predominantly Catholic country As De k t r is the only meeting point for all three metro lines it s an apt place for the tiny Metro Museum FAV M zeum located down in the pedestrian subway Here you can see the original train that travelled on Europe s first continental underground railway in 1896 it s hardly different to those on the current Millennium line Almost opposite the Lutheran Museum next to MacDonald s is the helpful Tourinform tourist information of ce The mustard building dominating the far side of the square is the Anker Palace formerly an insurance company headquarters and one of the very few structures to escape World War II unscathed Walk down Barczy utca which runs along the back of the Lutheran Church and on your right the Budapest City Hall lls an entire street It was built in 1711 as a home for disabled soldiers served for a time as an army barracks and became the town hall in 1894 The 19th century Neo Classical Pest County Hall lies a little farther beyond the bend in the same street Just off here is Szervita t r notable for a splendid patriotic religious Art Nouveau mosaic fantasy It occupies the very top of the old Turkish Banking House Head south along Peto S ndor utca on your right is the P risi Udvar Paris Arcade built in 1909 Inside look up to enjoy the exotic Art Nouveau styling and glasswork then walk round to see the stylish front of the building where there is an IBUSZ tourist information of ce Directly across the busy road it s best to use the underpass are three ne churches and part of the university complex On the corner of Ferenciek tere stands the Franciscan Church constructed around 1758 Look at the relief on the side wall depicting the ood of 1838 that caused massive destruction in the entire inner city Then continue along K rolyi Mih ly utca past the yellow University Library building on your left On the opposite corner is the University Church Egyetemi templom Built between 1725 and 1742 by the monks of the Order of St Paul it features splendidly rich Baroque carving Turn into Szerb utca where there are more university buildings The Serbian Church on this quiet street dates from 1688 and has a beautiful interior The Little Boulevard Despite its diminutive name the Little Boulevard is very big on traf c it is definitely not the place for a leisurely stroll There are however three major points of interest that fall just outside the inner city side of this notional dividing line The most popular of these among locals is the Budapest Market Halls V s rcsarnok at the beginning of V mh z k r t by the Szabads g h d Liberty Bridge This vast old fashioned covered market is brimming with local colour and exotic smells There is also a lively daily market at Lehel t r north of the inner city in the Lip tv ros district take metro line 3 to the station at Lehel t r For visitors the most popular Little Boulevard attraction is the Hungarian National Museum Magyar Nemzeti M zeum This impressive structure built in Neo Classical style with Corinthian columns and a sculptured tympanum stands back off the road in its own big garden Inside amid monumental architectural and ornamental details the whole story of Hungary unfolds On display are prehistoric remains and ancient jewels and tools but there s no doubt as to which is the main point of interest just follow the crowd to the hushed room where the royal regalia resides The crown is romantically associated with St Stephen the great 11th century king but is actually of a slightly later date the lower half is 11th century the upper 12th century The beautiful gold threaded mantle made in 1031 is said to belong to St Stephen The sceptre also dates from around the 12th century It s believed that both the 14th century gilded orb and the 16th century sword are replacements of the original regalia that was lost The exhibition downstairs which deals with the history of the Carpathian Basin from prehistoric times right up to the Conquest of 896 has some good moments particularly when covering the Roman period it s worthwhile buying a copy of the English German guide book which costs only a few forints The exhibit upstairs covering the period from 896 to 1849 is of more general interest than the previous millennium A 17th century Turkish tent decked out with carpets is one highlight while other exhibits run the gamut of war and peace from suits of armour to room reconstructions The museum also boasts a natural history section but compared to the riches of the rest of the collection this is entirely optional viewing Back on the Little Boulevard at the start of Doh ny utca is a striking synagogue of enormous proportions built in a amboyant Byzantine Moorish style This is the Central or Great Synagogue dating from the mid 19th century which is claimed by some sources to be the biggest in Europe capable of holding up to 3 000 people Visitors are allowed in except during services between 10 00 a m and 6 00 p m to appreciate its quiet grandeur An interesting and informative Jewish Museum within the complex includes a moving exhibition about the Hungarian Holocaust Next door to the museum in a courtyard of the synagogue is a metal weeping willow fashioned by the artist Imre Varga see page 36 Each leaf bears the name of a Budapest family that perished in the Holocaust The site is deliberately chosen being above the mass graves of Jews executed by the fascist Arrow Cross government installed by the Nazis between 1944 and 1945 Lip tv ros Bounded by Jozs f Attila utca to the south and by Bajcsy Zsilinszky t to the east Lip tv ros Leopold Town lies directly north of the inner city Directions to find the Basilica of St Stephen Szent Istv n Bazilika aren t needed as its 96 metre 315 foot dome dominates the skyline The biggest church in Budapest built between 1851 and 1905 it is frequently full to its capacity of 8 500 people Its exterior is in a poor state though slowly being restored Before seeing the interior ascend the tower It s a long walk to the top but you are rewarded with Pest s highest viewpoint The interior of the basilica is dimly lit There is an interesting main attraction in a reliquary in a rear chapel the Szent Jobb Holy Right is the much revered holy relic of the right hand of St Stephen you ll need a 20 forint piece to illuminate it Szabads g t r Freedom Square a short walk to the north is probably Pest s nest architectural ensemble At its centre is an obelisk dedicated to the Soviet troops who fell in the city but the enormous ostentatious buildings surrounding the square are what really steal the show The superb lemon coloured Art Nouveau building close to the obelisk is home to the American Embassy Next door is the former Stock Exchange now the country s TV headquarters a showy eclectic building with some good reliefs The Hungarian National Bank on the opposite side of the square is the work of the same architect The great dome of Parliament equal in height to that of the basilica is clearly visible from the square The Houses of Parliament Orsz gh z were built between 1885 and 1902 as a symbol of the grandeur of the Austro Hungarian empire Its vital statistics are impressive 268 metres 879 feet long 691 rooms and an estimated 20 km 12 miles of staircase inside The architect may not have had London s Houses of Parliament in mind but whatever his intentions the Neo Gothic arches and turrets rarely escape comparison with those of Westminster Tourists are only admitted on group excursions and only to certain parts of the building when parliament is not in session the visiting arrangements do vary from year to year check with Tourinform as to the current situation If you are admitted on a guided tour you will probably be taken up the grandiose central stairway to a splendid 16 sided domed hall then into the lobby and nally into the principal debating chamber of the House Look out for the brass rack where deputies leave their cigars before they enter the chamber Across from parliament is the mighty Ethnographic Museum N prajzi M zeum built in the same era occupying the former location of the Supreme Court of Justice It is worth a visit for the palatial interiors alone but the exhibits here are also some of the most fascinating in the city Permanent displays show the fast disappearing world of Hungarian rural life and folklore these are underpinned by trenchant temporary exhibitions dealing with current issues such as the lives of Budapest s gypsies Andr ssy t The most attractive avenue in the city modelled after the Champs Elys es in Paris was a bold stroke of the 1870s Travelling straight as an arrow almost 2 4 km 11 2 miles from the inner city to the City Park it is the site of some of the nest architecture in Budapest The buildings that line it blend well yet almost every one has a unique feature a fountain a statue a mosaic or a frieze columns or arches There s a roomy patrician feeling here which belies the avenue s past names from the unpronounceable N pk zt rsas g tja People s Republic Avenue to the prosaic Sug r t Radial Road to the hated Stalin t You can visit one of the typically large n de si cle aristocratic homes right at the start of the avenue at number 3 now home to the Postal Museum There are some colourful and interesting exhibits here particularly the correspondence between Thomas Edison and the Hungarian telecommunications pioneer Tivadar Pusk s but the real attraction is the building itself particularly the stairway and balcony decorated with outstanding frescoes by K roly Lotz The State Opera House Andr ssy t 22 completed in 1884 by Mikl s Ybl is the most admired building on the avenue Its Italianate style and restrained proportions t in exquisitely with its surroundings The splendidly opulent interior may be visited by guided tours which are conducted daily at 3 00 and 4 00 p m subject to performances The architecture atmosphere and acoustics of the State Opera House rank it among the very best in Europe If you prefer entertainment of a slightly less highbrow nature then continue north for a block to the area known as Budapest s Broadway where you will nd several theatres and nightspots The cultural theme continues on the pedestrianized area of Liszt Ferenc t r where there is an excellent modern statue of Liszt conducting in caricature with ailing hands and windswept hair At the end of this street is the Academy of Music completed in 1907 This is an Art Nouveau gem from the fa ade where the statue and name of Liszt dominate through to the lobby and interior It is quite easy to get a look inside when there is no one playing Cross the busy intersection of Oktogon and three streets north at V r smarty utca 35 is the Ferenc Liszt Memorial Museum This is a delightful small collection of a few pianos memorabilia and period furnishings set in an apartment where the composer once lived closed Sunday and the first three weeks of August As Andr ssy t heads farther away from town the villas get noticeably grander and mansions in garden settings become predominant Kod ly k r nd Kod ly crescent named after another Hungarian composer is a splendid ensemble its curving fa ades decorated with Classical gures and inlaid motifs At number 103 is another charming small collection in the Museum of East Asian Art Hopp Ferenc Kelet zsiai M zeum which rotates pieces from Ferenc Hopp s collection comprising 20 000 exotic items A related Museum of Chinese Art K na M zeum also known as the Gy rgy R th M zeum lies to the south of here occupying a handsome Art Nouveau villa at V rosligeti fasor 12 Andr ssy t ends in an outburst of pomp at Heroes Square Hos k tere a huge open space housing the Millenary Monument built on the thousandth anniversary of the Magyar conquest Surmounting all is a 36 metre 118 foot column supporting the gure of the Archangel Gabriel who according to legend appeared in a dream of St Stephen s and offered him Hungary s first crown Around the pedestal on horseback sit Prince Arp d and the Magyar tribal chiefs while anking the column is a semi circular colonnade with statues of historical gures starting with King Stephen In front of the statuary is the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Facing each other across Heroes Square are two large Neo Classical structures that are almost mirror images not surprising as they share the same architect Undergoing long term renovation the building on the left is the Museum of Fine Arts Sz pmuv szeti M zeum holding the city s most highly regarded collection which ranges from Egyptian mummies and Greek and Roman relics the latter collection is undergoing long term restoration through Renaissance works to a collection of about 2 500 Old Masters of which some 800 are on show at any one time Italian Dutch German and Spanish schools are all superbly represented The latter is particularly notable with masterpieces by El Greco Goya and several other famous names There are also English French and Flemish rooms The favourite room for many however is the 19th century collection including a treasure trove of French Impressionist and Post Impressionist artists such as C zanne Pisarro Monet Gaugin and Renoir among others The section on sculpture and that on prints and drawings features works by Leonardo da Vinci The museum also has a coffee shop and a ne selection of art books and posters for sale Free tours are given in English every weekday morning at 10 30 a m Opposite the Museum of Fine Arts is the Mucsarnok or Palace of Art a modern art gallery which mounts high quality temporary exhibitions of the work of contemporary Hungarian and foreign artists Re opened in 1995 after undergoing renovations the gallery boasts the finest art bookstore in Budapest not to mention a beautiful exterior with a splendid pediment mosaic of St Stephen in his role as patron saint of the arts There is also a smaller sister branch in the City Park directions are posted on the front of the Mucsarnok City Park V rosliget Beyond the pompous formality of Heroes Square and away from the noise and traf c of Andr ssy t the City Park is a lovely green space where Budapestis can relax stroll have a meal hire a rowing boat go to the zoo or visit museums The park which covers some 101 hectares 250 acres began to evolve in the early 19th century though many of the present amenities were added during preparations for the Millennium festivities of 1896 Cross the bridge over the boating lake which doubles as an ice skating rink in winter The Castle of Vajdahunyad behind the lake was built as a prop for the Millenary Exhibition but proved so popular that it was rebuilt in permanent form It reproduces in convincing detail part of the exterior of the fairytale Hunyadi castle in Transylvania Inside the castle is the Museum of Hungarian Agriculture housing a comprehensive collection that illustrates the history of hunting fishing and farming If you want to see the castle at its best return by night when it is beautifully illuminated Within the grounds there s a Catholic church with a splendid Romanesque portal another reconstruction and one of the city s favourite statues which depicts the medieval chronicler who gave Hungary its rst written records Unfortunately he didn t leave us his name so his face is hidden deep inside the cowl of his monk s style robe he is referred to simply as Anonymous There are two more museums in the park both towards its top right hand corner The Museum of Aviation and Space Travel occupies part of the Peto Csarnok Peto Hall the city youth centre where rock concerts often take place while you will find the Transport Museum K zleked si M zeum on the perimeter path of the park Both of these deal almost exclusively with Hungarian developments and are most likely to appeal to specialists or children The jewel in the park is the Sz chenyi Baths complex to the left of the road that bisects the park This is one of the largest medicinal bath complexes in Europe it also provides year round open air swimming at a constant 27 C 81 F in beautiful surroundings The buildings constructed between 1909 and 1913 in a Baroque Art Nouveau style are topped by a series of huge green domes Inside the pool area the walls are ivy clad and there is some sumptuous statuary but even more interesting than the architecture of the baths is the bizarre sight of groups of men playing chess while immersed in warm water their boards are supported on small jetties protruding into the pool Just behind the baths are the zoo and two amusement parks The zoo welcomes visitors with an Art Nouveau entrance decorated with polar bears and elephants It keeps a wide range of animals including most children s and adults favourite species The animals are mostly held in traditional cages though renovations on several pavilions are in progress Grown ups may like to note that next to the zoo is Gundel s restaurant a legend in Hungarian culinary circles Vid m Park next door is an old fashioned funfair style amusement park for the kids You won t nd American style thrill rides here just carousels dodgem cars a ferris wheel and a few other low technology sources of fun A mini version of the park more suited for younger children adjoins it Next door to the amusement parks a circus makes regular appearances throughout the year For dates consult Programme magazine see page 118 If you want to return to downtown Pest but feel you have walked enough for one day take the Millenium line metro which runs the whole length of Andr ssy t look for the antique yellow F ldalatti signs The quaint old fashioned trains are a tourist attraction in their own right Note that the trains run in the same direction as traf c and you must descend to the platform from the appropriate side of the road it is not possible to cross the lines once you are underground The Great Boulevard The Great Boulevard Nagy k r t forms a long sweeping arc from the Margaret Bridge to the Peto Bridge It has over the centuries changed in name from Ferenc to J zsef to Erzs bet to Ter z and nally to Szent Istv n yet its character remains consistent big and bustling City planners approved the project and pushed it through during the landmark year of 1896 when the volume of traf c was considerably less than it is today The buildings that line the boulevard are routinely six or more storeys high many with ornate architectural touches The architectural pride of the Great Boulevard has to be the Museum of Applied Arts Iparmuv szeti M zeum just off Ferenc k r t at 33 37 lloi t The exterior is a splendid example of Art Nouveau incorporating Hungarian folk art styles and using Hungarian majolica tiles Great green cupolas small spiky towers a majolica lantern and a bright green and gold roof top the ensemble The architect of the museum d n Lechner is regarded as the greatest exponent of this native form of Art Nouveau style The interior is if anything even more remarkable The style itself may best be described as fantasy Hungarian with strong Moorish in uences Shimmering white Arabian Nights type arches balconies and swirling staircases sweep up to a ne Art Nouveau skylight The main hall is covered by a great expanse of glass supported by an iron frame and ferns and potted plants around the hall create an exotic ambience A fascinating permanent exhibition showing the progress of native arts and crafts techniques from the 12th century onwards is augmented by a variety of temporary exhibitions which are usually of a very high quality on more specialized subjects A museum of an altogether more restrained nature lies just beyond Erzs bet k r t at H rsfa utca 47 The Philatelic Museum B lyeg M zeum contains every stamp issued by the country from 1871 onwards and so provides its own miniature pictorial history of the country Ter z k r t and Erzs bet k r t have traditionally been centres of Budapest s cultural as well as its commercial life At the Great Boulevard s intersection with Doh ny utca is the New York Caf formerly known as the Hungaria The caf s Neo Baroque Art Nouveau interior shining with polished wood brass and cut glass has been restored to its original gaudy glory it looks the same as it did at the beginning of the 20th century It is once again a meeting point for actors writers and journalists Excursions The Danube Bend Only a few miles north of Budapest the Danube dramatically alters its easterly course for a southern tack The prosaic name of this beautiful region is Dunakanyar meaning Danube Bend Here the river is at its most alluring the countryside is lush and mostly unspoiled and there are three delightful historic towns to explore Szentendre Just 20 km 12 miles from central Budapest Szentendre is the most captivating of the Danube Bend settlements The easiest way to reach it is by the HEV suburban railway from Batthy ny t r During summer boats make a five hour journey all the way from Budapest to Esz tergom stopping en route at Szentendre and Visegr d On your approach to Szentendre don t be put off by the modern suburbs the heart of the town remains virtually locked in the 18th century Right at the centre is Fo t r a picture postcard cobblestone square The iron rococo cross in the centre was erected in 1763 by the Serbian community in gratitude for being spared by the plague and the majestic Serbian church on the hill is the town s most prominent landmark Serbian refugees twice settled here in the wake of Turkish invasions first in the late 13th century and then again in 1690 On the latter occasion around 8 000 Serbs brought their religion art architecture trades and crafts and commercial acumen to Szentendre The church in the square the Blagovestenska Eastern Orthodox is known as the Greek Church Greek refugees also ed here even though it too is Serbian Built in the mid 18th century its interior is a little gem with a collection of Serb painted icons well worth seeing On one side of the church in what used to be an 18th century schoolhouse you will find the Ferenczy Museum displaying works by the Hungarian Impressionist K roly Ferenczy and his two children Another museum on the opposite side of the church con rms Szentendre s status as an important artists colony The Margit Kov cs Museum is the former home and workshop of ceramicist Margit Kov cs 1907 1977 unknown outside Hungary but worthy of an international audience Inside there are attenuated sculptures of wide eyed damsels poignant religious icons and ordinary people stooped and tragic bearing the whole weight of Hungary s 20th century misfortunes The rust red mid 18th century Serbian church on the hill is only open for services but in its grounds is the excellent Collection of Serbian Ecclesiastical Art displaying precious carvings icons and manuscripts The oldest church in the town lies just above here on top of the hill affording a perfect vantage point from which to peer down into the tiny gardens and courtyards and across the town s venerable rooftops The Catholic parish church dates mostly from the 13th century though parts of it go back to the 11th century During summer and early autumn craft and souvenir stalls congregate around here Opposite the church is another good local artist s collection that of the Impressionist B la Cz bel You will nd much more art on display in town but don t miss the modern art in the Barcsay Collection on the road out to the bus and railway station If you want a change from museums and galleries a 4 km 21 2 mile trip out of town brings you to a great place for historic films the Hungarian Open Air Village Museum Sza badt ri N prajzi M zeum which is an offshoot of the Ethnographical Museum Catch the number 8 bus departing from the terminal next to the HEV station and ask for the Skanzen There are also regular buses from the Tourinform of ce on the road from the bus station to the centre The 46 hectare 115 acre museum site will eventually contain ten villages of real houses churches mills farm buildings workshops and smithys dating mostly from the late 18th to the early 20th century and culled from all over Hungary At present there are only three settlements to view but even these will occupy you for at least half a day and possibly longer It is a fascinating and picturesque simulation of old rural Hungary brought to life by active craftspeople gingerbread makers and other rural folk Try to come on the rst or third Sunday of the month when there are several different craft demonstrations An excellent guide book giving the general history of the villages and buildings and details about individual interiors is available for purchase Don t miss climbing up the hill to visit the Greek Catholic Church from M ndok in northeast Hungary originally built in 1670 and boasting a painted iconostasis The village is closed from November to April Visegr d Farther up the river where the Danube bends lies Visegr d You can get here by boat or the bus from Szentendre This is one of the most picturesque sections of the river where verdant hillsides roll down almost to the water s edge The nest place to enjoy the views reminiscent of the best of the Rhine are at the Citadel high on a hill above the ruins of the old palace of Visegr d which means high castle in Slavic The strategic value of a site commanding the river bend has been recognized since the fourth century when the Romans built a fort here In the 14th century the Angevin kings of Hungary built a palace on the site each monarch adding new rooms and more opulence until the establishment covered an area now estimated at some 18 hectares 44 acres By the end of the 15th century when King M ty s see page 16 was resident the palace like his grand Buda residence was famous all over Europe One rather unwilling and notorious resident was the monstrous Vlad the Impaler on whom the Dracula legend was partly based held prisoner here from 1462 to 1475 Like King M ty s s Royal Palace in Buda the palace of Visegr d fell into ruins in the Turkish occupation and was completely forgotten Excavations began in 1930 part of the main building has been unearthed and certain parts have been rebuilt using obviously new materials to differentiate these sections from the original ones Among the best of the discoveries are the superb Hercules Fountain a rare vestige of Hungarian Renaissance architecture the vaulted galleries of the Court of Honour and the restored Lion s Fountain On the hillside the hexagonal tower known as the Tower of Solomon is now a museum of the palace Topping it all is the Citadel which was once considered so impregnable that the Hungarian crown jewels were kept here Esztergom The third of the Danube Bend towns Esztergom situated a farther 20 km 12 miles upriver is linked by hydrofoil to Budapest and by boat or bus to Szentendre and Visegr d Take the boat if you have two hours to spare as the river s most scenic stretch lies between Visegr d and Esztergom King Stephen was born in Esztergom during his time the medieval capital of Hungary It is still the religious centre of the country boasting the largest church in the land The towering basilica stands on the site of an 11th century church where Stephen was crowned as the rst king of Hungary in the year 1000 This church was destroyed in the struggle with the Turks and for all its massive dimensions or perhaps because of its size the only part of the current structure that generates an ancient atmosphere is the rather spooky crypt The most valuable part of the basilica is the red marble side chapel called the Bak cz k polna a pure example of Italian Renaissance style Built in the 16th century the chapel taken from the ruins around it and reassembled in the 19th century is all that survives of the original basilica Note the white marble altar which was sculpted by a Florentine master Don t miss climbing the stairs of the Basilica for two more highlights The treasury contains what purports to be Hungary s richest store of religious objects including a crystal cross from the ninth century and the 15th century Calvary of King M ty s From priceless treasures ascend the tower for a priceless view As well as looking down over the town you can also see across into Slovakia The Danube forms a natural boundary the bridge that up until World War I linked the two countries was symbolically left in ruins It s a melancholy sight that recalls Hungary s claim on that part of the land north of the river lost in the punitive 1920 Treaty of Trianon Those interested can cross over by ferry at this point Note that the treasury as well as the tower are closed from November to April Alongside the basilica the remains of a medieval royal palace have been excavated and restored and today house the Castle Museum Among the highlights in the museum are St Stephen s Hall the frescoed Hall of Virtues listed as Prudence Temperance Fortitude and Justice and the 12th century Royal Chapel The most popular collection in Esztergom lies at the foot of the Basilica Hill at the riverside The Christian Museum Kereszt ny M zeum with the most important provincial collection in Hungary is the best religious art museum in the country Covering mostly the Gothic and Renaissance periods from the 13th to the 16th centuries it has some very good 14th and 15th century Italian paintings Look out as well for the 15th century Cof n of Garamszentbenedek an intricately carved and painted devotional vehicle previously paraded in the streets at Easter Lake Balaton Hungary may be deprived of a coastline but in Lake Balaton a freshwater haven surrounded by verdant hills fertile plains orchards vineyards and historic villages they have the next best thing The northwest tip of Balaton is around 100 km 60 miles from Budapest lying within an easy and comfortable day trip of the capital Buses and trains serve the lake and coach excursions visit here in summer Balaton is the biggest lake in central and western Europe measuring 77 km 48 miles across with an area of nearly 600 km2 230 square miles Yet its average depth is less than 3 metres 10 feet in winter it freezes over completely while in summer the shallow water is subject to wind driven waves and when a storm blows up even the ferries call it a day However for most of the summer the hot sun warms the tranquil lake almost up to air temperature luring swimmers in the thousands into the water What s more the mildly alkaline water is said to be positively healthy for bathing a claim that few seaside resorts can make in these days of polluted shores The Balaton authorities also ensure that the lake is kept clean and calm by banning motor boats with exceptions that require special permits If the sh are a barometer of a lake s health all would appear to be hazard free about 40 species thrive in it Balaton pike perch fogas is usually singled out as the tastiest of all Fishermen operate from shore from boats and from platforms set a little distance into the lake Ice shing has been popular since the earliest times when winter was the only season in which the catch could be preserved and sold in distant parts of Hungary The frozen lake is also used by ice yachtsmen whose wind powered boats skate at hair raising speeds across the frozen lake Agriculture ourishes all along the circumference of the lake enhancing the area with fruit trees rippling expanses of wheat and in the area of Badacsony some of the best vineyards in Hungary The north and south shores of the lake have their own distinct personalities The north shore shelves quicker and in many places is less suited to bathing than the southern shore The north is backed by hills greenery and quaint villages the south is atter and has extensive tourist facilities perfect for the more hedonistic holiday maker The North Shore Driving from Budapest and navigating the lake in an counter clockwise direction along the perimeter Highway 71 the rst settlement of any size is at Balatonalm di There is a medieval chapel in the parish church but most people come here to enjoy the beach the biggest and one of the best equipped along the northern shore with space for 12 000 sunbathing bodies Signs for the beach read strand but that won t guarantee you a sandy or even pebbly foreshore it simply means the lake edge which may be sand lawn or even concrete Balatonf red some 13 km 8 miles farther west has a history as a spa stretching back to Roman times The main square called Gy gy t r meaning Health Therapeutic Square is a handsome place where the local mineral water bubbles up from the ground beneath a pagoda like well head On three sides of the square stand grand old buildings the 18th century Horv th House once an inn now a miner s sanatorium the Trade Union Sanatorium of 1802 and the Cardiac Hospital which has treated heart patients from all over the world The small grove in front of the square has a number of trees dedicated by personalities who have visited here including Indira Gandhi Just off the square is Blaha Lujza utca with a ne 1867 villa On the opposite side of the road is the best coffee house on the lake Kedves has been going strong for two centuries and once you ve tasted their chocolate cake you ll understand why At the end of this street is a rotund church built in the 1840s and a small museum to the Hungarian author M r J kai closed November to February It is not all cures coffee and culture here Balatonf red is also one of the lake s liveliest resorts bustling by day and night One of the most attractive spots on Lake Balaton is the village of Tihany The place gives its name to a peninsula which almost cuts the lake in two and ends at the ferry point of Tihanyi r v where there is a Club Med style camp and hotel offering a gamut of entertainment The peninsula is unspoiled and protected by its National Park status It even has its own small lake popular with bird watchers and nature lovers To the south are the domes of former geysers Tihany is built high on a hill above the main lake and its principal street Pisky s t ny a promenade has a few charming traditional thatched houses Start your tour of the village below this point at the Abbey Church Ap ts g which stands just off the main road The present 18th century Baroque church stands over an atmospheric crypt almost a thousand years old A rare survivor in a land constantly ravaged by so many invasions it is claimed to be the oldest in Hungary Here you will nd the tomb of King Andr s Andrew I who in 1055 founded the Benedictine Abbey that once stood on this site The church itself is being renovated at present but even through the tarpaulins you can glimpse its rich Baroque carvings and decorative ornamentation Next door to the Abbey Church housed in the old priory is the Tihany Historical Museum closed November to February This museum features regional folk items and art three small rooms where Hungary s last king K roly IV lived for ve days in 1921 and in the basement an atmospheric lapidarium containing Roman remains In front of the church King Andr s is commemorated in a typically offbeat Imre Varga statue wrapped in an aluminium cloak Some of the quaint thatched white houses that run along Pisky s t ny have been converted into an Ethnography Museum similar to the one at Szentendre see page 64 but on a much smaller scale In the Fishermen s House for example you can see canoes and shing equipment used on the lake until the 1930s museum closed November to April A promenade overlooking the lake passes restaurants as well as craft and souvenir shops before it ends at Echo Hill where the views are ne even if the reverberations you hear aren t what they used to be A marked path continues to the v r not an old castle as the name suggests but a volcanic outcrop dotted with cells made by monks The name of the region of Badacsony is as inextricably linked with Hungary s wine industry as that of Burgundy or Beaujolais in France Apart from the opportunity to sample the local tipple it s the scenery that appeals to visitors here the region s volcanic past is evident at rst sight of the conical green hills The central basalt peak Mount Badacsony the biggest of all the extinct volcanoes at 437 metres 1434 feet is invariably described as cof n shaped The basalt organ pipes of Szentgy rgyhegy are an especially ne sight If you are feeling fit and energetic you can hike up these hills but the easy way is by car or by a jeep that shuttles passengers to and from the bottom of the hill to the wine museum and three small museum houses as well as scenic points of interest A little way farther west set off the main road is the small settlement of Szigliget The moody remains of a 13th century castle offer ne views of the village and lake The last town on the north shore Keszthely pronounced kest hey was once owned entirely by the wealthy Festetics family and their palace is one of Hungary s most important Baroque monuments open all year round Here among a selection of its 101 rooms you can see something of the aristocratic life the family enjoyed during the 18th and 19th centuries The highlight is the Helikon library claimed to be the greatest in the country and it alone is worth the palace entrance charge which is hefty by Hungarian standards A member of Hungary s dynasty Count Gy rgy Festetics founded Europe s rst agricultural school here in 1797 which is now the Keszthely University of Agricultural Sciences A museum situated on Bercs nyi utca preserves the memory of early local farming methods and equipment The university gives the town another focus other than tourism something unique among the lakeside settlements and as a by product there is a good selection of bars and restaurants Continuing out of Keszthely to the southwest on Highway 71 you reach another good historical collection The Balaton Museum portrays the story of the settlement of the lake and the development of its people including their agriculture and shing and its fauna and flora in a lively exhibition The South Shore Just off the southwest corner of the lake lies Kis Balaton Little Balaton a marshy National Reserve noted for its rare birdlife Observation towers are provided for watchers Fony d ranks as the second largest of the south shore resorts and ferries run from here to Badacsony A better place to stay might be Balatonf ldv r arguably the area s most attractive resort well landscaped around parks and gardens At Sz nt d the lake is squeezed to its narrowest point by the Tihany peninsula Cars invariably queue here to make the ten minute crossing to the north shore On the other side of Highway 70 almost due south of the ferry point is Sz nt dpuszta Traditional life on the country s Great Plain the puszta is evoked through some 30 buildings dating from the 18th and 19th centuries including a few farm buildings a church and a cs rda rustic restaurant Displays of horsemanship craftsmanship and other rural activities are given regularly The largest town on the lake s south coast is Si fok This fairly popular tourist spot boasts a strand which holds thousands of sunbathers and lively nightlife Pleasure craft depart from the large harbour but the most pleasant stretch of waterfront is the gardens immediately east of the port Continuing eastwards just before the hotel zone is the town centre which has a small museum
