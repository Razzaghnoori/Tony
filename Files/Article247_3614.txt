 In the World and of the World Dear Russ Well OK OK so you liked Ross book While I don t share your enthusiasm I agree that Ross and you make an important point Celebration is not a world apart It is like all real estate development part of local politics for example It exists in a place where people have options where they want to live which is also why it is unfair to expect Celebration to be all things to all people You point out that Disney was uniquely burdened I think that s very well put One of the parts of both books that most surprised me was the extent to which the homebuyers themselves saw Celebration as a utopia chiefly because Disney was involved On the other hand especially in the early days Disney aggressively marketed the town as a solution to just about everything So it was disingenuous of them to withdraw from the town at a later stage Another aspect of Disney s involvement that struck me was that while they were very good at the architectural scenographic aspects of creating Celebration as one would expect and it is a beautiful place when it came to education they seemed out of their depth In hindsight this too was to be expected Why should an entertainment corporation understand anything about education The Celebration school is the one part of the town it seems to me where Disney slipped up and slipped up badly Both books tell that part of the story well The burdens that Disney carries also mean that it would have been almost impossible for Celebration to be for example a social experiment Both books bemoan the lack of affordable housing for example But almost no new private residential developments including New Urbanism have succeeded at mixing incomes to any considerable degree the exception are Hope VI projects which do achieve income mixing although they are still too new to draw categorical conclusions from Could Disney really have done better in this area It is not an issue of money they could certainly afford it it is one of risk Corporations have money and a certain degree of power at the same time they are vulnerable to public opinion Look at what happened when the school failed An article immediately appeared in the Wall Street Journal quoting disgruntled parents More recently a crime in Celebration was prominently reported in the New York Times Which raises an interesting point Does the occurrence of crime make Celebration a failure as the story implied or prove that it is a real place after all Witold
