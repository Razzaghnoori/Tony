 Shooting Script You have to be true to yourself as a writer but I don t think you have a responsibility beyond that said Brian Helgeland the opening speaker at Guns Don t Kill People Writers Do a panel discussion sponsored by the Writers Guild of America earlier this month Hopefully that s enough if you take yourself seriously Enough for what or for whom Helgeland didn t specify The writer director of the ultraviolent Mel Gibson movie Payback squirmed uncomfortably in his chair on a dais in a Santa Monica hotel ballroom a few hundred yards from the Pacific Ocean pondering the question of whether people who make violent movies are morally responsible for inciting real world violence Dressed in frayed shorts and sandals blond hair flowing Helgeland looked as if he had stashed his surfboard behind the stage and couldn t wait to escape into the waves crashing outside On the opposite end of the stage was Motion Picture Association of America Chairman Jack Valenti suited and tied camera ready and eager to pontificate Other panelists included scripters of major screen mayhem Steven De Souza Die Hard Callie Khouri Thelma and Louise Miguel Tejada Flores Fright Night Part II William Mastrosimone Extremities Sy Gomberg When Willie Comes Marching Home moderator Dan Petrie Jr Beverly Hills Cop and producer Sean Daniel The Mummy The audience was packed with worried industry insiders still reeling from President Clinton s just announced call for a Justice Department FTC investigation to determine if Hollywood markets violent product to children For this we need a federal investigation Does anyone think it was over 17s who bought 162 million worth of tickets to The Matrix The town was awash in rumors of imminent subpoenas and talk of Democratic Sen Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut s threats of criminal prosecution and censorship Adopting the cigarettes don t cause cancer posture studio heads have declined credit for encouraging children to commit murder Apparently they were counting on Clinton whose coffers are stuffed with Hollywood cash to go easy on them On Valenti s recommendation they snubbed Clinton s invitation to a White House conference on violence in the media letting slip their best chance to get out in front of the issue Now Clinton appeared to be punishing them for their hubris You turn down the president of the United States at your own peril says one movie producer Valenti should know that He worked for Lyndon Johnson While the Hollywood suits block feelings of guilt with reiterations of their commitment to shareholders the Writers Guild talk revealed a creative community roiled by emotions ranging from angry defiance to extreme remorse to abject terror Sparring over their role in instigating high school gun battles they fell into lock step on one point God save us from regulation by Bob Barr and Tom DeLay If the First Amendment has lost luster elsewhere it is ever the rallying cry in Hollywood where free speech can be relied upon to protect profitable dreck At the same time this overwhelmingly liberal community happy to jettison the Second Amendment is steamed that Washington has gone soft on the gun lobby I feel that the viewpoint I just heard is a very dangerous ivory towerism said Mastrosimone the prickliest conscience in the group countering Helgeland s be true to yourself as a writer remarks The people who say it s all our fault are extremists and I think the people who say we have no responsibilities are also extremists If we re really looking for the truth we ll find it somewhere in between It is unquestionable there is a cause and effect between what goes up onscreen and behavior there are thousands of scientific studies since the 60s that people choose to ignore because it s really not lucrative to obey them And we have become very spoiled because we enjoy this freedom and we don t want anybody on the outside telling us what to do De Souza was up next a flinty showman who played the scene aggressively This is the first time I ve ever volunteered to come and be a scapegoat he said De Souza disputed the link between screen violence and real world violence but also ranted against gun proliferation arguing that Japanese and British kids watch violent movies but don t go out and kill each other Like a fifth grader at show and tell De Souza held up the Nazi propaganda magazine Signal and pointed out sanitized images of Hitler youth groups Here you had the most wholesome upstanding media you can imagine and meanwhile offstage is the most mechanized bloodbath in history he said He spread the moral responsibility around noting that legally the studio is the author of a movie I tell you every picture I have done has come out more violent than what I wrote I have sat at the screening of one of my movies and been stunned at the level of mayhem that somebody put onscreen So now do I feel guilty He didn t answer his own question Khouri a native of Paducah Ky site of a major school shooting cited the familiar litany of parental neglect breakdown of education and community and the Internet as causes of teen violence Yet she was ambivalent about blaming Hollywood There s no one person that can be held responsible for this she said But for us to sit here and say feed em a steady diet of whatever they want and then when they act out it s your fault it doesn t add up We re trying to make sense out of something that will never make sense People read The Catcher in the Rye and shoot John Lennon There s always going to be somebody who is going to misinterpret something Khouri added that she was stunned at Thelma and Louise s first screening when the audience cheered the heroine for shooting a male attacker I had hoped for a completely different reaction from the audience a realization that this character had just sealed her fate in a horrible way I was terrified And I realized that I can t control how my work is perceived After Thelma and Louise Khouri challenged herself to write a movie with no guns in it It s harder she says Do we want the world to be as frightened as so many of us are and so many children are asked Gomberg who organized the Committee to End Violence after the Jonesboro Ark killings Do we have the right to impose this gun culture on the world They all want to be like us I don t think we do Gomberg advocated the elimination of excessive or gratuitous or unpunished violence in movies and television De Souza rankled barked When you say unpunished violence it reminds me of the old green code Undeterred Gomberg continued We have to aim our sights higher I hate to use the term aim sights but the easiest thing in the world to write is a villain you get the audience so involved in hating that you scream inside for the hero to demolish him Creatively we can find ways to get the same kind of tensions and passions going By that definition Richard the Third is a terrible evil play responded De Souza knowing that no discussion of violence in art is complete without an invocation of the Bard It spends all of its time making us hate hate that villain And there s a gory bloody end and a lot of bodies Let s not even go to Titus Andronicus That got a big laugh which encouraged Helgeland to drop the other bit of Shakespearean boilerplate What if a teen ager who was hopelessly in love saw Romeo and Juliet and decided to kill himself Should we not perform Romeo and Juliet any more Patiently awaiting his moment Valenti erupted in a burst of his usual flowery oratory If I ve learned one thing in the movie business and the world of politics he intoned it is that the First Amendment the 45 spare unadorned words bleached dry of all ambiguity is the one clause in the Constitution that guarantees all others And it s not easy to be a First Amendment person because then you have to allow into this marketplace that which you believe to be soiling and meretricious and tawdry and unwholesome and sometimes vile And then sometimes people get so vexed they want to call their congressman and say pass a law to stop all this stuff But I always say to this person be wary and be cautious Before you make that call remember that when a tyrant first appears he always comes as your protector Hoots of approval rose up from the crowd Billed as a session of self scrutiny the discussion was turning into a call to arms against enemies of the First Amendment Daniel wrapping up the session soberly reminded his colleagues that those who have abused their absolute freedoms by making movies that are soiling and unwholesome have only themselves to blame if Hollywood s era of unregulated bliss is over All of us have to understand that we are citizens whether we like it or not he warned Both Steve and Jack have rendered articulate and righteous defenses of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution But none of us should leave the room without an understanding that for parents all over the country the fear is real the problems of raising kids are real The ballroom emptied leaving the day s topic frustratingly unprobed No one had bothered to press Valenti on whether the government should properly give more weight to the safety of its citizens than to free speech Neither had there been any mention of the roots of Hollywood s love affair with violence As writer actor Harry Shearer who spoke later on a panel on comedy pointed out The thing that is rarely mentioned is that because this is a puritanical society and you can t show sex we eroticize violence It started with The Wild Bunch We sexualized violence we made it beautiful Was Littleton a watershed Under pressure from President Clinton the leading theater trade association says it will now bar the under 17 crowd from R rated movies rumors have it that the MPAA will be stricter about slapping R ratings onto violent movies Disney plans to stop featuring guns in its marketing materials and studios have canceled the development of some teen horror movies Are these serious measures by moviemakers and politicians With so much money and so many votes at stake both Hollywood and Washington are driven by fear and committed to appearances If there were a little bit less finger pointing and a little more assumption of responsibility for a problem whose causes are many it would be easier to have faith
