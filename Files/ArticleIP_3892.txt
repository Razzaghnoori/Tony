say is Gee Si you ve been holding out on us Entertaining as Let Si Get This was it bears no relation to my experiences at the company over the past year Either those of us who work at the West Coast outposts aren t in on the perks or your research was a tad out of date Victoria von BielBon App tit magazineLos Angeles Negative Action In Blacks Only Jacob Weisberg appears to be all over the map On the one hand he correctly diagnoses the central problem with affirmative action which is that it causes one group of people blacks to be favored at the expense of another group whites Yet at the same time that he admits this is unfair he proposes that we retain it How to justify then the fact that a white person who has never practiced discrimination and who never had anything to do with the subjugation of blacks should be placed at a disadvantage in relation to less qualified blacks Why should whites who did not themselves discriminate against blacks be punished for what their or someone else s ancestors did The answer is that it shouldn t be thought of as punishment This is Orwellian logic at its best it is reminiscent of communist propaganda at its worst Despite the fact that on its face it is punishment we shouldn t think of it that way Excuse me Perhaps extending Weisberg s philosophy a bit further we should simply declare that there is perfect equality between blacks and whites in society even though there isn t Why should we ignore the fact that there is inequality between races in society The answer is that it should not be thought of as inequality Seems to work for me Stephen Konig Roanoke Va Irrational Exuberance In Take This Simple Test Steven E Landsburg goes into quite some mathematical detail about the public s so called irrationality But there s no need for woolly notions of regret to explain why someone would rather have 1 million than a shot at 5 million but would rather have a shot at 5 million than a slightly better shot at 1 million It s very simple really 5 million isn t worth five times as much as 1 million If I receive 1 million I m rich If I receive 5 million I m rich So the first choice should be read as being between the certainty of being rich and a possibility of being rich The second choice is a simple mathematical choice as Landsburg points out 500 000 is a lot more welcome than 110 000 I m sure that if you asked the same questions but divided all the amounts by a million your answers would be very different Felix Salmon New York City Steven E Landsburg responds I am deluged with e mail from readers who want help understanding my column Take This Simple Test In the course of responding I ve found a much better way to explain the paradox In the original column your cousins Snip Snap and Snurr asked you to choose among various gifts Let s put those questions aside Instead here are three simpler questions A I m going to give you a Christmas gift Do you prefer 1 A duck 2 A goose B There s an 89 percent chance I won t give you anything for Christmas There s an 11 percent chance I ll give you a choice of gifts If I give you a choice of gifts do you prefer 1 A duck 2 A goose C There s an 89 percent chance I ll give you a duck for Christmas There s an 11 percent chance I ll give you a choice of gifts If I give you a choice of gifts do you prefer 1 A duck 2 A goose I define a rational person to be a person who gives the same answer to all three questions Some rational people prefer ducks to geese some prefer geese to ducks but no rational person switches answers in going from one question to the next Now replace a duck with 1 million and replace a goose with a 10 11 shot at 5 million Then Questions A B and C are identical to the questions of Snurr Snap and Snip in that order So a rational person should give the same answers to the questions of Snurr Snap and Snip To see that these questions are exactly the same as the Snip Snap Snurr questions keep in mind that an 11 percent chance of a 10 11 shot at 5 million is the same thing as a 10 percent chance at 5 million Notice that contrary to the expectations of several readers none of this has anything to do with the fact that 5 million is worth less than 5 times 1 million replace the 5 million with any other amount whatsoever and the argument still holds Harry and Louise Practice Post Structuralism One glaring weakness of deconstruction a method of literary criticism long favored by the academic ivory tower elite is that it often searches for meaning in a comparison where in reality there is none However useful in the rarefied halls of academia it is conspicuously ineffective in the real world Robert Shrum s comparison of the Harry and Louise ad campaign with that being conducted by the Global Climate Information Project Harry and Louise Go to Kyoto is no more than an interesting academic exercise and a cynical misrepresentation of both the facts of the global climate debate and the membership of the National Association of Manufacturers It is wrong to characterize the U N Map ad campaign as a use of populism by big business The ad campaign is simply one way in which we are attempting to educate the public on the effects a treaty in Kyoto would have on the 18 million people who make things in America Furthermore the overwhelming majority of NAM members are small manufacturers To lump these small companies many of which are family owned businesses with fewer than 500 employees in with the artificial moniker of big business itself a populist tool of the left is a disservice to the men and women whose efforts form the backbone of one quarter of our economy These small manufacturers would by the very nature of their size feel the devastating impact that mandated carbon based emission reductions would have on the U S economy to a greater degree than any other group The AFL CIO and NAM are united in opposition to a treaty mandating emission reductions because such a treaty would take a bite out of the budget of every American family in the form of among other things higher costs at the gas pump more expensive home heating and lost jobs The United States cannot see its competitiveness and prosperity erode for the benefit of developing nations that for whatever reason will not be required to abide by the strict impositions of a global climate treaty That is a fact that bears repeating over and over until reason wins out over the scare tactics being employed by environmental extremists and political consultants in the furtherance of their own agendas Paul Huard
