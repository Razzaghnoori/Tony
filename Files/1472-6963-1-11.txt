 Background Over 32 million elderly Americans are enrolled in the Medicare health insurance program Since 1982 the Health Care Financing Administration has offered a managed care option with capitated payment to Medicare enrollees Currently nearly 15 of Medicare enrollees are members of managed care plans nationwide 1 The economic incentives of capitated payment have raised concerns that managed care organizations that use capitation might limit provision of effective services as a way of trimming costs 2 3 4 5 Public concerns about restriction of service in managed care organizations have led to proposed legislation for a patient s bill of rights 6 once again being considered in the US Senate 7 It is becoming clear however that managed care is not a single entity and that a wide range of economic incentives and disincentives may be created in various forms of managed care 8 each likely to have different kinds of influence on clinician behavior 9 10 11 The proximity of risk to the clinician or clinician group has an especially strong effect on behavior 12 Systems maintained by managed care organizations to assist clinicians in providing quality care also differ widely and may strongly influence performance Although reduced access to care is a theoretical risk of capitated payment relatively few studies have addressed whether this concern is borne out in practice Perhaps because of the variation in managed care arrangements the results of studies have been mixed 13 If managed care presents barriers to access to effective care the elderly would be especially vulnerable because they have a higher burden of illness than the rest of the population We therefore created indicators in several domains for which it was known that care improved outcomes We then used these indicators to compare health care received by elderly Medicare beneficiaries in three kinds of payment arrangements a capitated staff model health maintenance organization HMO and a partially capitated group model HMO both parts of the same managed care organization and in fee for service FFS care in the same geographic area Methods Study site Staff model HMO The Staff Model division of HPHC provided primary care based multi specialty care The organization has cared for aged Medicare patients in risk and other commercial plans since the mid 1980 s All primary care providers were salaried and there were no specific economic incentives i e no bonuses of any kind for individual providers during the study period Information on all ambulatory services including visits diagnoses procedures and tests was maintained electronically for all members as part of an Automated Medical Record System AMRS 14 These data have been used in previous studies 15 16 17 The Staff Model HMO contracted with area hospitals for inpatient services For hospitalization and other outside utilization the HMO maintains claims data using ICD 9 codes this data structure contains up to six diagnoses and up to 3 surgical procedures per claim Group model HMO The Group Model division of HPHC included 16 medical groups in 1993 that contracted with the HMO on a non exclusive basis i e they were exclusive with regard to other managed care plans but not with respect to indemnity insurance Most were primary care groups but a small number were multispecialty groups Payment of groups was based on various forms of capitation the most common arrangement was for groups to be capitated for both primary and specialty outpatient care and for hospitalization risk to be shared in a wider pool Capitation rates and details such as loss limit provisions varied from group to group Almost all groups comprised between 5 and 10 physicians Data from the Group Model were obtained from claims that were submitted to the HMO to document care for calculations pertinent to loss limit provisions even though payments were not based on the claims themselves Data files contained information on services provided in the offices of the primary care clinicians on outpatient services not provided by the primary care provider i e referrals and on hospitalizations Diagnoses and procedures were coded using ICD 9 and CPT 4 codes Demographic and insurance coverage information on members in the study were obtained from HMO enrollment files Fee for service Medicare beneficiaries were included in this study if they were age 65 and older as of January 1 1994 had both Part A and B coverage for at least 12 consecutive months during 1994 and 1995 were not enrolled in an HMO during these 12 consecutive months and resided within the HMO catchment area see below We matched Medicare members enrolled in the HMO with those in fee for service by area of residence First we constructed a list of the zip codes in which eligible HMO members resided during the study period We constructed a list of Medicare fee for service beneficiaries residing in the comparison area consisting of all contiguous zip codes in which at least one HMO Medicare beneficiary resided The resulting sample included 339 627 people Data for the fee for service sample were obtained from an enrollment file for demographic information the MedPAR Medicare Provider Analysis and Review file for hospitalization claim data Part B physician supplier claims file and Hospital Outpatient Department claims file Performance indicators We developed performance measures that met several or all of the following criteria the disease or condition was relatively common and potentially severe a clinical service that could affect the health outcome of the patient was identifiable the performance of the indicated service depended in part on the role of a physician or health system and not only on the patient service performance was potentially subject to financial incentives it was possible from other research to assume that the indicated service would on average improve outcome and data to construct the indicator were currently or potentially available Our indicators assessed access to health care in three domains Table 1 1 preventive care including services that provide future not current benefit 2 diagnosis specific care examining treatment for acute conditions or episodes of disease and 3 chronic disease care including secondary prevention The selection of preventive care indicators was guided by the generic applicability of these maneuvers in this age group making it unnecessary to define a special population for whom the procedure would be indicated The indicators of timely follow up after hospitalization diagnosis specific care were selected based on the seriousness of the medical conditions 18 the time interval between hospital discharge and outpatient visit were determined by a panel of physicians A panel of national experts in access to quality health care convened by the Health Care Financing Administration in March of 1996 suggested additions to our original indicator set We then selected those that best met the structured evaluation criteria including at least two indicators in each of the domains Table 1shows the indicators organized by domains More complete definitions of inclusion criteria and coding including specific AMRS ICD 9 and CPT codes used have been published elsewhere 19 and are summarized in Additional fileIndicator Definitions Statistical analyses We compared the three samples by age category using the chi square test For annual indicators we averaged utilization rates for 1994 and 1995 the denominators were individuals eligible for each calendar year We calculated rates in three age strata age 65 74 75 84 and 85 years and older We also calculated age adjusted rates standardized to the fee for service sample Analyses were performed using SAS 20 We conducted two way comparisons of age adjusted rates across the three samples Staff Model Group Model and fee for service using the chi square test Results Demographic characteristics of the study subjects are shown in Table 2 The FFS population in the region under study was older than the nationwide Medicare population and a slightly larger proportion was female 62 versus 60 p 0 001 Those enrolled in the HMO were younger than both the geographically matched fee for service sample and Medicare enrollees in the US as a whole p 0 001 and they were less likely to be female p 0 001 Age adjusted rates of breast cancer screening with mammography were substantially higher in the two HMO settings than under fee for service insurance Table 3 Mammography screening rates in the Staff Model were nearly double those in the FFS sample The proportion of Medicare enrollees who saw a clinician within a one year period Annual visit rate Table 3 was greater than 85 in all three groups however this rate was significantly higher in the Staff Model HMO 94 than the fee for service sample 88 p 0 001 Proportion with follow up by either a primary care physician or cardiologist within 60 days of hospital discharge after myocardial infarction Table 4 was similar in the two managed care divisions and in both cases higher than under fee for service insurance 91 and 93 in the Staff and Group Model respectively compared to 73 in FFS p 0 001 Follow up within 14 days after hospitalization for depression was highest in the Group Model HMO although small sample size limited our ability to find statistically significant differences p 0 3 Care of chronic diseases is summarized in Table 5 Screening rates for diabetic retinopathy were higher in both divisions of the managed care organization than in the fee for service sample The proportion of diabetics with 2 or more visits was 50 higher in managed care than in fee for service 95 and 91 in the Staff and Group Model respectively versus 61 in FFS p 0 001 Discussion We developed a set of indicators of access to effective care for elderly people insured by Medicare designed to fit varying clinical settings insurance structures and data systems In general performance in both the Staff and Group Model divisions of the managed care plan studied was equivalent to or better than that in the fee for service sector Other investigators have devised administrative claims based indicators 21 22 and chart review based indicators for hospitals 23 and ambulatory care sites 24 in efforts to compare hospital performance or health plan performance In contrast we explored the feasibility of using data elements available in an automated outpatient medical record which are increasingly prevalent in addition to those available in claims databases The indicators we selected overlap with those chosen to be included in the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set HEDIS for the Medicare population released in 1997 which also evaluates breast cancer screening and retinal screening for diabetics 25 Previous studies comparing performance indicators across insurance types have found inconsistent results HMO performance on preventive services is consistently higher than in FFS settings 26 27 28 On the other hand some studies findings have raised a concern that vulnerable populations such as the chronically ill 29 and the elderly 30 fare less well in HMOs than in FFS care In the Medicare population data to support concern about worse outcomes of care in HMOs has come from a national telephone survey about persistence of symptoms 29 In numerous other investigations however care for the Medicare population provided by HMOs has been shown to be comparable to that in FFS No differences between HMO and FFS samples were found in studies of care for colon cancer 31 3 2 breast cancer 33 34 prostate cancer 35 cardiovascular disease 36 rheumatoid arthritis 37 congestive heart failure 38 hypertension 39 acute myocardial infarction 40 acute appendicitis 41 and stroke 42 One study found that functional status did not decline faster among Medicare recipients enrolled in HMOs versus those in FFS 43 Our findings are consonant with these previous studies for example a higher rate of mammography screening as seen in our managed care population could explain the trend to earlier stage breast cancers seen in California among HMO enrollees compared to FFS 31 32 While most of previous work focussed on specific disease entities we studied the general Medicare population and measured indicators applicable to all enrollees as well as indicators focussed on specific disease populations There are few studies of the effect of managed care structure e g Group vs Staff vs IPA models on indicators of quality care 44 45 These models differ both in the extent to which financial risk is attached to individual providers and also the degree to which providers are effectively formed into an organized system of care For example some of the differences seen in our study between the Group and Staff Model were probably due to organizational processes and systems in place in the Staff Model such as physician reminder systems for preventive services leading to higher rates of breast cancer screening This study has several strengths We included a large number of Medicare enrollees covered by the health plan studied and the universe of fee for service Medicare enrollees in the same geographic region Matching by region reduces the variation that may have affected some previous comparisons of FFS and HMO populations in which national samples were used 46 This method also automatically accounts for any spillover effect of managed care practices onto fee for service practice wherein cost saving techniques are applied widely by providers even to those with fee for service insurance in a market with high penetration of managed care insurance 47 In contrast to studies that focus on inpatient data in part because of their ready availability 48 our focus on outpatient care is highly relevant to comparisons of managed care with fee for service care 49 in terms of ambulatory practices that may prevent hospitalizations Our work on the time period 1994 95 follows the transformations in managed care in 1991 1993 and thus can been seen as an update to previous studies of the topic 13 Our study also has limitations People enrolling in managed care organizations may be systematically different from those choosing fee for service arrangements 50 For example patients who are sicker or more disabled may not enroll 28 or may differentially choose to leave managed care 51 Those who do enroll could be more aggressive in seeking care We know that a smaller proportion of HMO enrollees were over the age of 85 years compared to the matched fee for service sample Differential enrollment could influence our results if patients with higher degrees of co morbid conditions preferentially enrolled in the fee for service system and did not participate in cancer screening or secondary diabetic prevention because of their other illnesses 52 In addition the annual visit rate could potentially be overestimated in the HMO population if an influx of new patients and a new enrollee effect were to cause more patients to come in for visits than otherwise would Another potentially important limitation is that different data systems created for different purposes such as claims and clinical databases may not provide comparable results even for strictly defined indicators 53 54 The use of performance indicators to compare care provided in different settings usually requires expensive data gathering Indicators based on automated data systems offer partial relief to this problem Our findings related to staff model and group model HMO types should be replicated in other settings and extended to other types of managed care While the staff model HMO share of the market is shrinking group and network model health maintenance organizations are experiencing increased enrollment Our finding of concordance on many indicators between the Group and Staff Model divisions suggests that a less tightly organized provider system may perform as well as a staff model HMO Neither of the HMO divisions studied resembles an independent practice association IPA model so our findings may not apply to that form of provider organization In addition we studied only one managed care organization one that is well established and exists in a region of the country with high level access to specialty services The generalizability of our findings to other managed care populations is unknown Furthermore the single HMO studied is a not for profit organization and our findings might not be applicable to for profit entities 55 Conclusions In conclusion we believe that the indicators we have tested are feasible to implement in other managed care systems and could be translated into other electronic medical record systems Indicators such as these might be useful for consumers in comparing health plans to one another such as those participating in Medicare Choice We found no evidence of any decrement in access to health care for the elderly Medicare population enrolled in one managed care plan in this geographic region The low or no cost supplemental insurance provided by many HMOs may in fact lower financial barriers to care for low income seniors Our study describes only two models of managed care and this is a crude classification by current standards Yet to be studied are the effects of financial incentives on increasingly smaller units of leverage e g small IPA model groups and the effectiveness of managed care plans that use sophisticated information systems to track and improve care as compared to those that use principally financial incentives 56 57 The latter is crucial to understanding how best to create a partnership between providers and health plans that facilitates the provision of excellent care Competing interests None declared
