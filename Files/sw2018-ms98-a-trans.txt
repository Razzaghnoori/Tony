 hello this is Lois hello hi hi this is Lisa and um i called you know from that the the TI Database Calling Instructions um hum yeah i got a call yesterday too this is a different subject though yeah this is about changes in women in the um hum uh there s really a lot isn t there i mean there really is yeah it s kind of an easy thing to talk about oh i guess the work force would be the main wouldn t it it uh yeah um i think you have to push one and then we can start recording it okay all right are you ready now okay like i said i guess it would be the work force you know as far as changes in the generations okay yes yes i know because i know when my mother was a you know going into the work force there wasn t very many opportunities for her i guess she s in her late forties you were expected to stay home and take care of the kids and i ve never faced that at all um no i think now now you go to work when they re six weeks old you know and you stay there and i feel like the next generation you ll probably just work right along with your husband you know uh huh yeah um hum i think it s definitely gotten better oh i do too much and it s just gonna get better it really is um hum because women are in every field now i mean i can t think of a field that they re not involved in oh i can t either not a one i know at least in the medical field it seems like they ve come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field i don t think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing um hum yeah even in Washington you know there seems to be lot more women involved yeah hopefully the next generation it won t even be an issue i mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman i think that would be the best goal yes yes oh i do too just your qualifications and that would be it uh huh exactly not what color you are how old you are what if your male or female that would be wonderful i guess it s kind of an ideal world though huh yes yeah yes um yeah yeah i kind of think maybe in time that you know you ll go by social security numbers you know and that way they can t say well they picked the male over a female or female over a male you know you yeah yeah yeah exactly or the way you look or the way you you know your age or anything i think that d be a wonderful way to do it yeah they ll just i do too just go by your social security number and then look at your qualifications that you know that you have um hum and then and if you get it you know then um hum also with uh women in the work force they ve gotten a lot more options as far as you know what s it called job sharing like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job or um hum oh yeah uh huh as a matter of fact that s what i m doing um hum it sure is it sure is is it that would be great or a lot of women i know now and my uh one of my supervisors when she went on LOA to have her baby we hooked up a a a terminal at her house um hum and she you know we could send her messages and and she kept in touch like that and basically just worked out of her house i would just take her the actual paperwork once uh every week or two and that worked out great too oh uh huh yeah yes that is i mean that s a real attractive option if you have the the technology for it all it was was you know i mean she just used a phone modem and she was like she was sitting in the office um hum yeah so i think that s real nice too to come up with different options do you like the job sharing oh oh i do i really do i think it s great do you do you work like half days or half weeks or uh well like one week she ll work three days and i ll work two and the next week you know i ll work three and she ll work two we just share off like that hm oh is oh that s great uh huh do you get the full benefits um hum yeah we get the full benefits but we ve just really got a wonderful system that we re working under yeah oh that s wonderful yeah especially with children and so many things going on that would be great yes it really is and that way we re not really missing anything out you know of those children uh huh either way yeah you have your career and your home life and that d be a nice way to especially if you have young children um hum yes oh it is it is well both of ours is school age but we don t want to miss any of those PTA s and you know all of that so so um hum oh no i think yeah my son s just in day care but even that they have extracurricular activities and the older they get the more that you re involved in that um hum yeah yes i think it s great i really and i look for more of that in the next generation yeah i do too especially as women get up in management and and can be in on those decision making you know when that subject comes up they can say yes that would be wonderful um hum um hum yes oh i do too yes plus i bet it cuts cuts down on your absenteeism because you ve got two days off that you can do everything so you don t have to you know unless you re just really sick or the child s sick but yeah yeah because most time now you know it s just a weekend or just forget it yeah um hum oh yeah i have to plan way in advance because or what i ve done is found like doctors and dentists office with extended hours that s been real helpful too like my doctor stays open till nine in the evening uh huh oh yeah so that s real helpful so you don t you know have to do it during office hours run out on your lunch hour i don t know how many times i ve done that to do something post office or the bank or any uh kind of errand to do yeah um hum yeah i think we ve really come a long ways in that because yes so uh huh i guess i take it for granted kind of because i just it s always been that way but i know um hum yeah but i can remember remember back growing up my mother i mean it was she always worked but it wasn t that easy for her to just take off oh no i can remember my mother getting in trouble if you know one of us was sick and i know she probably didn t make hardly anything you know compared to the work that she did oh yes um hum where oh yeah yes i think there s still some discrimination there where as you know men and work women work in the same job i think men get paid more but i think that s improving it s such a slow process it s frustrating but oh i do too yes yes yes i mean you can see that it s wrong and you just wanna make it right but at least the wheels are moving forward um hum they really are yeah i think it s getting better not worse well i should probably get back to my job i know i know the feeling well it was okay and i sure will and bye bye call again okay bye bye
