        wondering how you keep up on the news   primarily with our local newspaper and TV   umhum   i listen to the radio but not um not like i did when i was working i am recently  retired to that means i have a lot of time to watch the news on TV how do you gain your news     i guess the i get the Washington Post and that is  pretty big newspaper and i think thats almost exclusive my exclusively my first of the news though i have the radio on when i go to work i dont think the news usually hits  because im not going right on the hour   oh i see well thats that is one of the handicaps with both TV and   yeah   and radio if youre not available on the hour or half hour then you lose out on an awful lot well what is your newspaper that is the Washington Post is that correct i have read that when we were in that area and it its a splendid newspaper   right umhum   so what more do we need to discuss tonight that seems like a very short one     right i think that you know weve weve resolved the issue and thats what we were asked to do      well i can discuss a lot of the news that we have but um i feel that thats not part of our responsibility   right right   so thank you for calling   oh okay well thanks for discussing it byebye   all right good night
