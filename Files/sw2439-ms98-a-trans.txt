 okay so what kind of cars are you looking at well we ve uh we ve we ve test driven the Oldsmobile Delta eighty eight and a Cutlass Supreme and a used Cadillac about three or four years old um hum um hum because uh i get married in a couple of weeks and i have two kids and my fiancee has two kids so we need we need a car that s big enough for six um hum yeah and so that we went i guess it was two weekends ago we went uh car shopping and looked around uh um hum we found something interesting at Crest Oldsmobile Cadillac up there on Central Expressway um hum that uh in addition to to getting a new car there they can get you a car that s new but it s been uh a demonstrator model oh okay for uh two or three thousand dollars even cheaper than the best deal they can give you for a new car uh huh so they call this program cars and they come with a new car warranty and it just seems to make sense to me to get the most car for your money to get something like that right that s a real good deal in fact my dad recently got a um a Pontiac uh believe six thousand uh huh and he got a a demo and it s been a real good car and it s it s like new and it only had had very very low mileage on it okay yeah uh huh sure and so he i think he got a real good deal of course they re fully loaded usually so it s i think it s a pretty good option oh yeah yeah i think so too are the uh Oldsmobiles that you re looking at are they the demos or they used are they new well the the ones that we were test driving were the uh were the new ones there um hum well now um uh huh now they may be the demonstrator models but that the sales reps drive around in um hum and then the Cadillac is is definitely a used car or uh huh yeah it was in eighty eight the guy said it d been on the lot about thirty minutes he says it ll probably be gone in a day and it s probably gone by now oh no those things go fast uh huh um uh of course we re we re not we can t consider getting a brand new Cadillac because those are twenty twenty five to thirty thousand dollars but when they re three years old they re the price already drops in half yeah um hum so then it becomes uh more realistic right that s what i m thinking about on my next car is do i want to get another brand new car because last two cars are brand new or do i want to look for a used car that s maybe two three years old that but that s you know low mileage and in good shape uh huh yeah but i just i kind of worry about getting a car that s that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the person that owned it want to get rid of it is it a lemon or or is something wrong with it but i guess that s a risk you have to take that s right that s right well you can reduce that risk by uh having the car checked out i mean you know you you if you re going to look at fifty different cars you don t want to do this but if you ve narrowed it down to one or two um hum um hum you can have the car uh uh checked at uh an independent service station and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong because they don t have any financial interest in it um hum right and then you ll have a realistic assessment of what you re getting um hum about how much do they charge to do something like that do you know oh i m thinking around twenty or twenty five dollars yeah that s not bad no huh uh it d be well worth it if you re considering buying a car to find out yeah i i would i would think so yeah well it s kind of hard for me to talk about buying cars because i just got mine paid off about a month ago and i yes i don t want to think about buying a car for a while i just want to enjoy not having any car payments for a while and isn t that a good feeling that s right and enjoy watching my savings account get larger and uh you know hang on to the one i ve got for a few years because it s it s it s almost four years old but it s still in great shape i have a Mazda RX7 well what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for for three or four years and when you re ready to get another car just pay cash for it um hum yeah i just about could really because i think my car if i continue taking good care of it it s going to hold a pretty good resale value and uh that if i consider going the used car route and save up some money i shouldn t have too much trouble at all yeah oh yeah um hum yeah i would i would think that s true could you hold on for just a moment okay sure okay i m on a cordless phone and i was picking up uh some background noise so i just switched the channel up on it i didn t want to interfere with whatever they re trying to record so anyway right right that s fine but uh i really i really enjoy the car i have now and i do want to hold onto it and and uh you know enjoy it while it s not having any mechanical problems whatsoever in fact it never has and uh that s right that s right it s been kind of nice and i surprisingly enough after four years i m not tired of the car at all and um well i ll just hang on to it while it s still being a good car and while i m not tired of it and while i m single and can handle a two seater for now and get that out of my system yeah yeah that s right that s right because one of these days i ll be getting a six seater probably too so um eventually yeah the first two cars i ever bought um well uh i ve i ve bought three cars and i ve i ve always bought them new the first car i kept for thirteen and a half years and got a hundred and sixty one thousand out of it um hum wow um hum the second car i ever bought i drive to work now that just turned ten years old and i ve got a hundred and twenty two thousand miles on that um hum so that that s kind of been the way i ve done things is to get things that are new and then keep them forever um hum but uh my car is is using two quarts of oil a week now oh my gosh about about a quart every hundred miles oh no so uh but but uh it runs fine all you have it s just very thirsty if i just keep the oil in it seems to be okay but you know that s a sign that i m going to have to do something sooner or later um hum yeah right what kind of car is it it s a a Buick Century um hum are you going to trade it in on this new one or uh no my fiance is selling uh a nineteen seventy eight Cutlass Supreme that she has it s actually in better condition than my car okay uh huh and so she s going to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try to make as much down payment as possible to keep the monthly payment low um hum so she s going to sell it rather than trade it in that s probably the best thing yeah um you you lose four to six hundred dollars a trade in or maybe more than that as i ve learned yeah when i bought my RX7 i uh best offer i got for my other car was twenty five hundred well i turned around and sold it myself for forty two hundred so oh really oh there you go you can do much better i m glad you re you re taking care of it yourself i i think trading it in they just use that as additional they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car you re buying but they just are going to give you that much less for your trade in well that s fact that s what i think so i think you re right but strangely enough the best offer i mean the best bargaining i had made with a dealer on my car was also the same place i got the best price interesting trade in but it s a place in Arlington and i think maybe as you get outside the Dallas area i kind of i bet you it s kind of what i decided well maybe because it s outside of Dallas they are giving a little bit better um hum prices plus i was going through that TI fleet discount program the okay did you did you use it the car shop place um well it s before they had that oh okay i had gone over to Texins and they had a little file where they said which dealers participated in the in the fleet program and what you could expect they said you know a five percent that s right yeah over cost and then options at cost and everything so i figured out a price based on that right right yeah that s good but i i guess i got a pretty good deal because i went back to the Town North Mazda right off central and offered them the same price as what i knew i was gonna be able to get it for in Arlington uh huh right and they said there is no way you can get this car for that price especially if we add on the equalizer and the and the cruise control he said you re going to get a car that s got flood damage or hail damage and they just laughed at me yeah yeah and i went the next morning to Arlington and they gave it to me for that price and what s so funny is they took the car they i knew they were gonna pull it from Town North because that s where the white one was and they had already told me we located one at Town North so it was that same car is that right my gosh and i said like yeah well unless you re selling car with hail damage and flood damage i got the car off your lot for that price and you and you laughed all the way to the bank oh i did and i laughed real hard when i took it in for the two thousand mile checkup and uh uh huh that they required you to do and i took it to Town North and sure enough i saw that guy and he recognized me he said he said oh hi Dana and he kind of looked down and saw that car and i m and i m sure he probably knew what was going on the very next day of course when when the place in Arlington yeah yeah yeah went and took the car because i told him there s a place in Arlington that s gonna give it to me for that price he said no they re not and the next day they that s right yeah pulled the white car and took it to Arlington so i m sure he knew so i loved it i sat there and i just had the biggest grin on my face such a deal i ll bet you did is kind of nice but well Dana it s been really interesting and i appreciate talking with you yeah good talking to you too Don okay have a good evening okay good luck in your car hunting uh huh bye bye thank you much bye
