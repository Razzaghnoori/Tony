 Background Diabetes mellitus predisposes individuals to bacterial and fungal infections including those caused by Candida species Many investigators have suggested that vulvovaginal candidiasis VVC occurs more frequently in diabetics 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Further chronic recurring VVC may be a marker of diabetes 9 Several studies report increased rates of asymptomatic vaginal carriage rates of Candida species and incidence of symptomatic infection in diabetic women but results are inconsistent 5 10 11 12 13 14 While some show no increase in carriage of vaginal Candida 5 those demonstrating increased Candida carriage in female diabetes patients do not examine the effect of glucose control or diabetes type 12 14 However in vitro studies demonstrating impaired host response directed against Candida in diabetics support the idea of increased rates of Candida colonization among diabetics 4 6 7 Whether diabetes leads to more symptomatic and or more recurrent VVC episodes is a subject of controversy Potential risk factors for VVC include diabetes type severity and degree of glucose control 26 27 28 29 30 In addition to diabetes mellitus a number of VVC risk factors have been identified including African American heritage 15 16 17 previous history of VVC 15 higher education degree intermediate age oral contraceptive pills 3 10 16 18 use of commercially available solutions for cleansing of external genitalia or vaginal douching frequent sexual intercourse 17 19 10 sexual behavior age at first intercourse frequency of oral genital contact 20 contraception devices diaphragm vaginal contraceptive sponge intrauterine device and antibiotics 3 15 19 Whether these factors increase risk of Candida colonization or symptomatic infection following colonization or both is unknown however it should be emphasized that a prerequisite for symptomatic vaginitis is vaginal colonization Few studies have addressed the relationship between Candida colonization VVC and diabetes none we are aware of have examined the role of behavioral VVC risk factors for colonization among persons with diabetes To evaluate the relationship between Candida colonization and hypothesized risk factors for vulvovaginal candidiasis colonization in diabetics we conducted a cross sectional study among female diabetes patients receiving care at one of two diabetes clinics We describe the associations between Candida colonization sociodemographics health behaviors diabetes type diabetes severity and Hemoglobin A 1c level among women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes Methods Study population Female diabetes patients seen at an outpatient academic diabetes practice of Wayne State University Division of Endocrinology Department of Internal Medicine were eligible for study The practice included an urban University Health Center Detroit MI clinic and a suburban clinic Hechtman Clinic Bingham Farms MI Patients were diagnosed with type 1 and type 2 diabetes on clinical presentation by a board certified endocrinologist Potential participants were approached in the clinic waiting room and consent obtained As an incentive for participation subjects were rewarded with video rental gift certificates value 5 Participants consented to a medical record review which included abstraction of total glycated hemoglobin levels obtained at the enrollment visit completed a self administered questionnaire and self collected a vaginal swab The questionnaire addressed the following variables sociodemographic age race marital status insurance status highest education completed occupation diabetes duration type severity and abnormal glucose level lifetime history of physician diagnosed VVC episodes recent antibiotic use by type sexual history health behaviors For the diabetes section we used questions from the Diabetes Care Profile an instrument developed and validated by the Michigan Diabetes Research and Training Center 21 22 The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of Michigan and Wayne State University Of 155 women approached 105 67 7 consented One woman was ineligible because her vaginal sample was lost Two women decided to stop participating during the study one did not understand the questionnaire while the other felt the questionnaire was too intrusive leaving a final sample size of 101 participants Laboratory methods All vaginal specimens were cultured for yeast Specimens were placed on plates with media selective for Candida growth Sabouraud s dextrose agar Suspected mixed samples as determined by colony type and microscopic characteristics were placed on plates with media showing species specific colony color change Chromagar CHROMagar Paris France C albicans and C glabrata were identified by chlamydospore and germ tube tests all other species were identified by carbohydrate assimilation tests API 20C AUX Data analysis We described the distributions of hypothesized variables among participants using simple descriptive statistics and the associations between hypothesized risk factors and Candida colonization using odds ratios OR and Cornfield 95 confidence intervals CI After a detailed stratified analysis to assess confounding and effect modification we fit a logistic regression model for Candida carriage We calculated ORS and 95 CIs for the bivariate analyses using EpiInfo 23 all other analyses and data management were done using SAS 24 Several variables strongly associated with Candida colonization had small numbers of missing values particularly for oral sex 13 and douching 9 others did not exceed 5 In this case for the multivariate analyses we inferred that a missing response was equivalent to a negative response If we are wrong in this inference the resulting estimates will be biased towards the null hypothesis of no effect Excluding the missing responses from the relevant analyses only modestly changed the point estimates Results Demographic characteristics by clinic Fifty nine participants were recruited from UHC forty two were recruited from Hechtman Mean age among UHC participants was 52 3 years while mean age among Hechtman participants was 50 0 years p 0 5 The clinics varied greatly however in participant ethnicity Forty of fifty nine 67 8 UHC participants were of African American descent By contrast eight of 42 19 0 Hechtman participants were of African American descent Diabetes characteristics Most participants had type 2 diabetes 62 101 61 By clinic type 2 was more common among UHC participants 69 but was equally distributed among Hechtman participants Total glycated hemoglobin levels measured at the time of the enrollment visit were abstracted from patient s charts We assessed glycemia by transforming total glycated hemoglobin levels to hemoglobin A1c HbA 1c values using a linear regression formula 25 For the Wayne State University patient population a value of HbA 1c 6 4 is abnormal This cutpoint was determined by standard clinical laboratory comparison methods and verification of the reference interval 26 27 28 29 30 The mean HbA 1c for our study population was 7 91 with a range of 4 4 15 7 Overall only 20 of 101 participants 19 8 had normal HbA 1c at time of enrollment Type 1 subjects had a higher proportion of abnormal levels 92 3 than type 2 subjects 72 6 p 0 02 Correlates of Candidacolonization 29 of 101 28 7 participants were colonized with Candida species 2 of the 29 6 9 were colonized with two Candida species The most common species were C albicans 12 29 41 4 and C glabrata 11 29 37 9 C albicans predominated among women with type 1 9 16 colonized or 56 and C glabrata among women with Type 2 7 13 colonized or 54 We identified one isolate of C parapsilosis C guilliermondii and Trichosporon beigelli Type 1 patients were more likely to be colonized with Candida than type 2 patients OR 2 6 95 CI 0 99 6 98 p 0 03 Table 1 Women with abnormal HbA 1c were almost three times more likely to be colonized with Candida than those with normal HBA 1c but this association was not statistically significant OR 2 7 95 CI 0 68 15 39 p 0 13 No statistically significant

status education and employment were not significantly associated with Candida colonization Table 1 Antibiotic use in the past 2 weeks lifetime history of chlamydia douching and report of both performing and receiving oral sex in the last two weeks were strongly associated with Candida colonization whereas vaginal penile sex had only a modest and not statistically significant assocation with Candida colonization When stratified by oral sex there was no association between vaginal sex and colonization status However the effect of oral sex remained after stratification by vaginal sex Multivariate Analyses To simultaneously adjust for variables independently associated with Candida colonization in the crude analyses we fit a logistic regression model predicting Candida carriage Table 2 Because of the small sample size we created a base model including age diabetes type abnormal HbA 1c recent antibiotic use and performing oral sex We assumed for this analysis that those who did not respond to questions about oral sex did not engage in oral sex Receiving oral sex was not associated after adjustment for performing oral sex OR 1 07 95 CI 0 12 9 42 p 0 95 and thus was excluded from the base model Other variables associated in the bivariate analyses were added one at a time to the base model After adjustment older age having type 1 diabetes an abnormal HbA 1c level and report of antibiotic use during the previous 2 weeks were statistically significantly associated with Candida colonization Performing oral sex was associated with an almost fivefold increase in colonization but the association was not statistically significant p 0 08 When added individually to the base model lifetime history of chlamydia OR 5 8 95 CI 10 9 30 54 but not douching OR 2 2 95 CI 0 68 7 00 remained strongly associated with colonization Four participants positive for Candida also had a previous chlamydia diagnosis and reported douching When entered simultaneously into the model the estimates were unstable thus they were entered separately Douching and history of chlamydia were also strongly associated with performing oral sex adding each of these variables reduced the parameter estimate and statistical significance of the association with performing oral sex Pregnancy history had no association with colonization after adjustment OR 0 97 95 CI 0 26 3 66 Discussion Among women with diabetes Candida carriage increased with older age type 1 diabetes abnormal HbA 1c level oral antibiotic use in the previous two weeks and ever history of chlamydia Other VVC risk factors including African American descent lifetime history of VVC higher education oral contraceptive use and frequency of vaginal intercourse were not significantly associated with Candida colonization after adjustment for other variables These data suggest that behavioral factors as well as HbA 1c are important determinants of Candida colonization among women with diabetes Women with type 1 diabetes had higher Candida colonization rates than those with type 2 even after adjusting for age behavioral factors and HbA 1c One possible explanation is difference in duration of Candida carriage women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes may be equally likely to acquire Candida but those with type 1 may be less able to clear it Similar to previous reports C albicans was isolated from the majority of colonized type 1 participants while C glabrata was the most common isolate in type 2 participants but our numbers are small 1 Whether this is due to diabetes type or reflects different distributions of Candida species by age or both is uncertain The observation that hyperglycemia in type 1 diabetes increases risk for Candida colonization is consistent with previous reports 1 5 6 31 A New Zealand study of 124 women with type 1 diabetes found 7 of 7 women with elevated glycated hemoglobin reported vaginal symptoms for the previous year compared with 60 overall 10 Hyperglycemia limits neutrophil function among persons with type 1 diabetes including neutrophils ability to phagocytose and kill Candida organisms With the oxidative killing ability of neutrophils hindered diabetics may not be able to clear pathogens as well as non diabetics 1 6 7 31 Hyperglycemic individuals may also have increased risk for Candida colonization because their secretions contain glucose which can serve as nutrients for Candida organisms Sobel and colleagues reported a fucose 6 deoxy galactose vaginal epithelial cell receptor that aids in adhesion of Candida to vaginal epithelial cells 32 Since fucose contains an isomer of glucose and acts as one form of receptor site for Candida adhesion it is possible that increased Candida colonization is proportional to glucose level Receptor avidity may be a reflection of increased glucose levels in the blood and tissues Glycemia however does not fully explain the observed increased risk of Candida colonization We found a borderline significant association with performing oral sex associated with an almost five fold increase in vaginal colonization with Candida Receiving but not performing oral sex has been previously reported as a risk factor for VVC 15 Oral sex may facilitate transmission of yeast as Candida often colonizes the oral cavity 15 33 Diabetics may be more likely to carry Candida in the oral cavity than their sex partner thus performing oral sex on their sex partner prior to vaginal intercourse may serve to inoculate the vaginal cavity Douching has also been previously associated with Candida colonization 17 19 20 The practice is hypothesized to disrupt vaginal flora vaginal symptoms may also lead a women to douche so the direction of effect is unclear The association we observed with chlamydia is probably a marker of sexual behavior rather than a causal factor for example women who reported a history of chlamydia were more likely to douche and to report engaging in oral sex although it is possible that chlamydia carriage adversely affects the vaginal flora increasing the chance of Candida colonization Recent antibiotic use is a well described correlate of symptomatic Candida vaginitis 3 15 16 17 18 34 While asymptomatic infection is not equivalent to disease antibiotic use may act to alter the vaginal microenvironment to facilitate Candida colonization in the same way it is hypothesized to promote VVC Women aged 45 years and older in our study were more likely to be colonized with Candida species We are unaware of colonization studies in women of comparable age most have emphasized women of childbearing age 8 35 36 Whether our observation is a real finding or a reflection of our age distribution 18 84 or unknown selection biases which led to inclusion in our study requires further investigation However incidence of symptomatic infection is higher in younger 18 44 women 15 This study is small and was intended to be hypothesis generating The study population is in no way representative of all females with diabetes although the age and racial distribution of participants reflected that of the participating clinics Although it is possible that women with a history of symptomatic infection might have been more likely to participate we have no reason to believe that women differentially participated by both symptomatic history and other variables under study which would have biased our results Further as women were unaware of whether they carried Candida at the time of completing the questionnaire it seems unlikely that a differential recall of behaviors among colonized and non colonized might have occurred A final concern is that Candida colonization while the first step toward VVC is not equivalent to symptomatic infection Larger more definitive studies which include a non diabetic control group and prospective follow up are planned Conclusions We found strong statistically significant associations between vaginal Candida colonization and antibiotic use lifetime history of chlamydia diabetes type and HbA 1c level and a borderline significant association with performing oral sex More non albicans species were observed among women with type 2 diabetes Improving glucose control and possibly modifying sexual behavior may reduce risk of Candida colonization and potentially symptomatic infection among women with diabetes Competing interests None declared
