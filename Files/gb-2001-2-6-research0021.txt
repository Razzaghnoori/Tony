 Background Mitochondrial genome overview The mitochondrial genome itself encodes only a handful of genes The largest mitochondrial genome discovered to date of the protist Reclinomonas americana codes for 97 gene products 67 proteins and 30 structural RNAs in a span of 69 034 base pairs 2 Human mitochondrial DNA is much smaller encoding 37 gene products 13 proteins 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs over 16 569 base pairs 3 All its encoded proteins are directly involved in oxidative phosphorylation and include components of complex I NADH dehydrogenase subunits ND1 ND2 ND3 ND4 ND4L ND5 ND6 complex III cytochrome b complex IV cytochrome oxidase subunits I II and III and complex V mitochondrial ATPase subunits 6 and 8 4 All other human genes encoding mitochondrial proteins total estimated at around 1 100 5 are transcribed in the nucleus translated in the cytoplasm and their products imported into mitochondria The interplay between organellar and nuclear genomes accounts for a large part of the diversity in mitochondrial pathologies Each human cell contains multiple mitochondria often dynamically interconnected in a complex reticular network 6 7 and each mitochondrion may contain ten or more mitochondrial DNA mtDNA molecules Usually all copies of mtDNA are identical a state known as homoplasmy Occasionally however mtDNA mutations occur and there arise two or more populations of mtDNA a state called heteroplasmy 4 In fact heteroplasmic mtDNA ought to be relatively common considering that human mtDNA mutates 10 20 times faster than nuclear DNA as a result of inadequate proofreading by mitochondrial DNA polymerases 4 and limited mtDNA repair capability This expectation is to some extent borne out by the relative prominence of mitochondrial disorders arising from mutations in the mtDNA although it is also important to note that such mutations being comparatively easy to identify by sequencing will naturally have been among the first to be characterized Disease classification Schapira has devised a classification scheme for mitochondrial defects 8 based primarily on whether or not the affected gene product is directly involved in oxidative phosphorylation and whether it is encoded by mtDNA or nuclear DNA A primary defect in oxidative phosphorylation defines class I Distinct mitochondrial pathologies may overlap more than one class for example Leigh syndrome see below Subclass Ia includes diseases arising from mutations in mtDNA genes encoding subunits of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation mitochondrial tRNA genes and mitochondrial rRNA genes This subclass has three related categories depending on the nature of the underlying mutations i large scale mtDNA deletions and duplications ii point mutations and small rearrangements in protein coding mtDNA regions and iii small scale mtDNA mutations in tRNA and rRNA genes 8 In order for a class Ia pathology to present itself the mtDNA mutation must occur in a significant fraction of the heteroplasmic mtDNA population as high as 60 for mtDNA deletions 9 Ia i and even up to 95 for tRNA mutations Ia iii 10 Class Ib mitochondrial diseases arise from mutations in any of the 70 odd nuclear genes encoding protein subunits involved in oxidative phosphorylation 5 These mutations can occur in exons or introns as well as promoters Class II mitochondrial disorders stem from secondary defects in oxidative phosphorylation Class IIa genetic pathologies are characterized by mutations in nuclear mitochondrial protein genes whose products are imported into the mitochondria but are not subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation apparatus There are four subtypes i mtDNA abnormality due to mutations in nuclear genes affecting mtDNA transcription translation or replication ii direct mtDNA damage or defects in mtDNA repair iii defective oxidative phosphorylation subunit import and iv defective oxidative phosphorylation subunit assembly 8 Type IIb pathologies arise from endogenous and exogenous toxins Results Primary mutational disorders of oxidative phosphorylation class I Leber s hereditary optic neuropathy Leber s hereditary optic neuropathy LHON the most common cause of male adolescent blindness is attributed to mutations in mtDNA genes encoding subunits of complex I NADH dehydrogenase ND alternatively termed NADH CoQ 1 reductase The most frequently encountered mutation 50 of cases among Europeans 95 among Asians is G11778A in ND4 Arg340 His Additionally G3460A Ala52 Thr in ND1 and both T14484C Met64 Val and G14459A Ala72 Val in ND6 rank among the other primary LHON associated mutations 4 11 As seen in Figure 1 the arginine residue at position 340 in the human sequence for ND4 NU4M_HUMAN which corresponds to position 300 of the profile is absolutely conserved across Gram positive Rv3157 Gram negative EC2277 archaeal PAB1432 and eukaryotic taxa NU4M_HUMAN and nad4_PRA The pathogenic mutation of arginine to histidine at this position represents a moderately significant divergence in sequence substituting an imidazole group for a guanidino group The two amino acid side chains differ in shape hydrogen bonding capability and degree of positive charge arginine always being positively charged at physiological pH histidine only having a positive charge about half the time The common missense substitution in ND1 that leads to LHON Ala52 Thr does not have as obvious an explanation for its effect Inspection of the set of aligned sequences Figure 2 shows that this position tolerates glycine and methionine as well as alanine Substituting a threonine for the alanine in the human sequence adds a beta branched amino acid capable of disrupting local secondary tertiary structure or possibly intersubunit interactions The hydroxyl group of the threonine may also form hydrogen bonds with neighboring amino acid residues so as to add to this potential disruption Further structural study of complex I will be required to explain how this mutation contributes to LHON The two common pathogenic mutations in ND6 Met64 Val and Ala72 Val lead to a less severe and a very severe form of LHON respectively 12 As Mycobacterium tuberculosis already uses a valine in position 64 Figure 3 it is understandable that the Met64 Val substitution should cause a less severe disease phenotype In position 72 only alanine and methionine have been seen among the identified homologs As such the introduction of valine adds a branched amino acid at a conserved non branched hydrophobic position Additionally the two eukaryotes Xenopus laevis and Homo sapiens have conserved the alanine whereas the more distantly related species all conserve a methionine Whereas only one of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit mutations occurs at an absolutely conserved position there are reasonable explanations for how the other mutations could manifest their likely pathology Leigh syndrome Leigh syndrome also known as subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy is another common mtDNA mutation disorder frequently associated with cytochrome oxidase COX deficiency 13 though no disease related mutations of the mtDNA encoded COX subunits have been reported A single T to G transversion at mtDNA position 8 993 changes leucine 156 of ATP synthase subunit 6 to arginine Leu56 Arg 14 Figure 4a Lower copy numbers of this mutation 70 are associated with neuropathy ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa NARP whereas high copy numbers 90 give rise to Leigh syndrome 15 Mutating the conserved leucine to arginine at position 156 is a drastic change disrupting a branched aliphatic residue with a basic guanidino group a major chemical and presumably structural substitution In this case structural data are available see Figure 4b and clearly indicates the key location of this residue at the protein protein interface of two of the subunits of the F 0 component of complex V ATP synthase Mutations found in at least two nuclear genes also correlate with Leigh syndrome one for a subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and one for surfeit locus protein 1 SURF 1 which is involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase As these are not oxidative phosphorylation proteins the mutations qualify as class II disorders A missense mutation Arg263 Gly in the E1 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase PDHA1 has been associated with Leigh syndrome Figure 5 This mutation seems to affect assembly of the E1 E1 heterotetramer 16 The gene s location on the X chromosome complicates its expression pattern in females as a result of the random pattern of X inactivation 17 Whereas only the human sequence uses arginine at this position all other taxa use a large hydrophobic amino acid either tyrosine or leucine note that even an arginine side chain has a substantial hydrophobic segment bearing its terminal guanidino group Substituting the small turn forming glycine residue could have a significant impact on proper folding of this subunit As shown in Figure 5b Arg263 is located quite close to the active site of the enzyme a region of the structure where even small perturbations could have large effects on activity The gene for SURF1 displays mutations Gly124 Glu and 110246 Thr that can also lead to Leigh syndrome 18 19 A number of deletions seen in SURF 1 do so as well The Ile124 Glu substitution disrupts an absolutely conserved glycine that most probably participates in a turn Figure 6 The Ile246 Thr mutation occurs in and probably disrupts a predicted sheet believed to be present in this protein from all higher eukaryotes It occurs toward the carboxyl terminus of the human protein and is beyond the region covered by the profile a reflection of sequence divergence between eukaryotes and prokaryotes in this region Mutations giving rise to Leigh syndrome have also been described in the flavoprotein subunit Fp or SDHA of the succinate dehydrogenase complex SDH 20 21 The mutant version C1684T Arg554 Trp Figure 7a of SDHA has a normal K m and K i for malonate but is much more sensitive to downregulation by oxaloacetate OAA Mutating the conserved arginine residue at position 554 to a tryptophan causes a loss of a polar residue and replacement with a much larger aromatic group It is not apparent from the location of this residue in the structure Figure 7b why this change should have such an effect on function It lies on the surface at a considerable distance from the active site and does not have any apparent role in subunit subunit interactions In fact however the high degree of sequence conservation over this entire region Figure 7a suggests that SDHA is fairly intolerant of mutations here Proper interaction with the lipid bilayer may partly explain the phenomenon Secondary mutational disorders in oxidative phosphorylation class II Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy Class II mitochondrial disorders are due to mutations in nuclear mitochondrial protein genes Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy MNGIE is characterized by ptosis progressive external ophthalmoplegia gastrointestinal dismotility thin body habitus peripheral neuropathy myopathy leukoencephalopathy and lactic acidosis and multiple mtDNA deletions or mtDNA depletion or both It is a class II mtDNA depletion disorder It is believed that the pathogenic mechanism relates to aberrant thymidine metabolism giving rise to impaired mtDNA replication and or mtDNA maintenance 22 Missense mutations in the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase TP Gly145 Arg Gly153 Ser Lys222 Ser Glu289 Ala and a few others have been found in multiple MNGIE patients and are believed to cause the pathology 22 TP catalyzes a step in the salvage pathway for thymine thymidine phosphate thymine 2 deoxy D ribose 1 phosphate In higher eukaryotes TP plays the role of platlet derived endothelial cell growth factor 23 evidently by virtue of the fact that the deoxyribose sugar product is used as an angiogenesis inducing factor 24 TP also has gliostatin activity Profile induced multiple alignments of this protein show a great degree of conservation over the pathogenic positions particularly for the Gly153 Ser mutation Figure 8 Glycine is absolutely preserved at this position indicating that it may be critical for proper folding Substituting a serine could disrupt this although a preceding glycine may partially compensate The Gly145 Arg substitution does not disrupt an absolutely conserved position as serine is also permitted but it introduces a large basic and partly hydrophobic residue that presumably diminishes at least one key function of TP Lys222 Ser and Glu289 Ala both disrupt absolutely conserved sequence positions the former of which lies on the periphery of the active site data not shown Ghu289 participates in some partly buried conserved ionic interactions more than 15 distant from the active site data not shown Deafness dystonia Deafness dystonia or Mohr Tranebjaerg syndrome is a mitochondrial protein import disorder Mutations in DDP1 deafness dystonia peptide 1 lead to deafness dystonia In two cases seen to date a 1 bp deletion in exon 1 T151del results in a frameshift leading to incorporation of 25 new amino acids after Glu38 followed by a stop codon In a second case a 10 bp deletion in exon 2 causes a frameshift at Met48 leading to incorporation of 12 new residues and a stop codon 25 These proteins are homologous to the yeast mitochondrial import protein Tim8p YJR135W A 26 As seen in Figure 9 both frameshift mutations lead to elimination of a highly conserved motif NCVpRFaDT near the carboxyl terminus of the peptide a region that must be critical to proper function or folding The recent publication of the first DDP missense mutation Cys66 Trp 27 strongly supports this prior conclusion based on the frameshifts As neither Tim8p nor any close homolog has yet had its structure determined we cannot infer detailed structure function relationships Tim8p and Tim13p exist in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and determine the location of Tim9p Tim9p is located either in the 70 kDa import complex between the mitochondrial membranes or the 300 kDa TIM22 complex embedded in the inner membrane 28 Deletions of Tim8p affect the ability to import mitochondrial proteins that become embedded in the inner membrane 29 It is possible that the frameshift mutations seen in deafness dystonia interfere with the interface between Tim8p and Tim13p Iron storage disorders Friedreich s ataxia also falls into the category of a class II mtDNA damage repair disorder It is characterized by progressive gait and limb ataxia lack of tendon reflexes dysarthria and pyramidal weakness in inferior limbs 30 Lack of frataxin protein causes a build up of iron in the matrix spaces of the mitochondria As iron accumulates it competes with catalase for hydrogen peroxide and forms hydroxyl radicals Fe 2 H 2 O 2 Fe 3 OH OH so called reactive oxygen species that can attack mtDNA membrane lipids carbohydrates and proteins This can damage the entire oxidative phosphorylation system especially the highly vulnerable iron sulfur centers The shortage of frataxin does not result from formation of mutant proteins but rather from expansion of a GAA repeat in the first intron of the frataxin gene This expanded repeat is believed to form localized RNA secondary structures that interfere with transcription 31 32 Yfh1p YDL120W the frataxin homolog in yeast interacts with the yeast mitochondrial intermediate peptidase Oct1 YKL134C to lower matrix iron concentration directly and by competition 33 Normal mitochondrial iron homeostasis minimally depends on wild type frataxin to control efflux Both proteolytic cleavage via MPP and or IMP complexes and chaperonin help mt HSP70 Ssc2p in membrane trafficking and or folding are needed for the mature frataxin protein to arrive at its destination in the matrix in its proper conformation Iron efflux also depends upon the iron sulfur cluster transporter Atm1p YMR301C A missense mutation in Abcb7 or hABC7 the human homolog of Atm1p Ile400 Met has been implicated in X linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia 34 a disorder closely related to Friedreich s ataxia Figure 10summarizes the sequence and phylogenetic context for this pathogenic change No experimental structural data are available but discrete state space models 35 36 H He G McAllister and T F Smith manuscript in preparation for membrane proteins clearly indicate that the mutation falls in an extracellular tight turn between transmembrane helices five and six A pair of cation transporters Mmt1 YMR177W and Mmt2 YPL224C in yeast controls iron influx into the mitochondria This other half of iron homeostasis could also easily have a role in Friedreich s ataxia and X linked sideroblastic anemia Hereditary spastic paraplegia Hereditary spastic paraplegia HSP a class II assembly disorder is characterized by progressive usually severe lower extremity spasticity due to degeneration of the long axons of the central nervous system while the cell bodies remain intact Inheritance can be autosomal dominant autosomal recessive or X linked Some cases of HSP result from mutations in the gene for paraplegin a nuclear encoded mitochondrial metalloprotease including a 2 bp deletion at position 784 which causes a frameshift that eliminates 60 of the protein and an adenine insertion at position 2 228 of the paraplegin cDNA which creates a frameshift resulting in truncation of the last 57 residues of this 795 residue protein 37 As shown in Figure 11 there are very few well conserved positions in the deleted 57 residue tail implying that this may be a comparatively disordered part of the protein No missense mutations have been found in human paraplegin to date This protein resembles three yeast proteins which function as chaperonins and or proteases Afg3p YER017C Rca1p YMRo89C and Yme1p YPR024W They participate in recycling the components of complex V ATP synthase as well as in its assembly The products of YER017C and YMR089C make up the mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase m AAA protease complex which is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane facing the matrix YPR024W encodes the i AAA protease complex which faces the intermembrane space The yeast m AAA protease complex is itself regulated by two prohibitin proteins Phb1 YGR132C and Phb2 YGR231C 38 Paraplegin homologs analogous to the yeast paralogs Afg3p Rca1p and Yme1p must almost certainly exist and human prohibitins may be expected as well Point mutations in conserved regions of these proteins can be expected to cause missense mutations and translational truncations that will also lead to hereditary spastic paraplegia Discussion The process of understanding genetic disease typically proceeds through three stages first recognition of the disease state or syndrome including its hereditary character second discovery and mapping of the related mutation s and third elucidation of the biochemical biophysical mechanism leading to the disease phenotype Sickle cell anemia provides the classic example In the case of mitochondrial diseases there are more than 100 described conditions OMIM 39 MITOP 40 and WUSTL 5 websites and a comparable and growing number of mutations 8 As already described for LHON Leigh syndrome and HSP the causative mutations are not necessarily confined to a single protein coding gene or even to the nuclear versus the mitochondrial genome Put differently there is no one to one mapping between mutations or even whole genes and a particular defined disease entity Thus each disease spectrum may correspond to several sets of mutations each set affecting one protein or protein subunit Obviously mutations in mt tRNA mt rRNA and proteins that affect mitochondrial gene expression will also potentially have pleiotropic effects The results presented here address the third stage of understanding genetic disease namely the characterization of the disease phenotype at the molecular level with a view to explaining its biochemical mechanism In principle the approach can be applied to any mutated protein coding gene When structural information is available the exact mechanism of disease causation may be ascertainable at the molecular level and testable by means of carefully targeted experiments A further extension of this basic knowledge approach lies in the direction of molecular evolution As we will show elsewhere T P T F S and S C M unpublished observations the extended sets of homologs assembled using prior based profiles provide a rich source of phylogenetic information Not only should it be possible to sketch out the history of the development of different biochemical machineries it should also be possible to establish which parts of the proteins are most critical to function on the basis of amino acid sequence conservation correlated with the structural contexts Knowledge gained by the approach described here has obvious application to both the diagnosis and therapy of mitochondrial diseases Once a mutation has been characterized the exact nature of the associated illness is known with precision This has a bearing upon choice of therapy and allows a much more exact prognosis than a characterization simply as say Leigh syndrome In addition the information from sequence alignments has predictive power mutations not yet recorded in the literature might turn up at key positions in some of the proteins known to be affected in mitochondrial diseases Individuals carrying such changes might be alerted to the possible harmful consequences and take whatever precautionary measures seem appropriate Note that substitutions in the human sequence that match amino acid residues found at the corresponding locations in taxonomically distant sequences are less likely to prove harmful than completely novel substitutions This application of informatics data will certainly grow in importance as acquisition of additional single nucleotide polymorphism SNP data becomes increasingly common and new paralogs and orthologs are added to the sequence database Finally depending on the nature of the affected protein and the frequency of occurrence of diseased individuals it may be possible to use the data for attempts at rational drug design or gene therapy The work reported here represents a preliminary overview of the field Eventually an exhaustive survey should be completed continuously updated and made publicly available That will require precise characterization of many more mutations as well as expansion of the database of mitochondrial protein profiles beyond what we have constructed using yeast as a model Such efforts are underway Materials and methods Yeast mitochondrial protein database YMPD We created a database of 430 yeast mitochondrial proteins using biochemical keyword searches for known mitchondrial processes from the Saccharomyces Genome Database 41 the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences 42 the Yeast Proteome Database 43 and MitBASE 44 and by monitoring the current literature Each member of this set of proteins is characterized by at least one prior based profile 1 that represents the most conserved region s As S cerevisiae does not use a canonical mitochondrial complex I we have substituted the NADH dehydrogenase protein subunits from R americana to initialize these profiles Developing prior based profiles Prior based profiles 1 the principal tools used in this work represent evolutionarily conserved sequence based functional domains Once created each profile can be used to search all available databases in an attempt to locate all homologous sequence matches which in ideal cases correspond to single protein domains This expanded set of homologous sequences is then multiply aligned using the profile as a template The set of multiply aligned sequences defines sequence domain boundaries allows putative functional assignments for previously unidentified proteins and highlights key conserved residues of members of a homologous set of proteins As new sequences and sequenced genomes become available our set of profiles can identify the additional homologs with high sensitivity and specificity 1 The profile defining set A defining set with a wide taxonomic spread should be optimal for locating distant homologs from as many species as possible Ideal profiles have a defining set composed of one protein each from a eukaryote an archaeon a Gram positive bacterium and a Gram negative bacterium and one yeast mitochondrial protein To create the defining set for each profile we established a superset of potential family members using BLAST searches 45 against our Biomolecular Engineering Research Center BMERC all genomes database and Swiss Prot 46 Each identified yeast mitochondrial protein serves as a seed initializing protein for a BLAST search The cutoff scores are set at an expectation value of E 10 6using the standard SEG and XNU filters for low complexity regions 47 From these BLAST hits we selected the initial defining set of maximum taxonomic spread In some cases BLAST fails to locate sequence homologs that have diverged greatly from the seed mitochondrial protein We then used an iterative procedure to generate a profile using local dynamic programming to maximize the information content For such cases the initial profile is run against the all genomes database by exhaustive local dynamic programming Then the next highest scoring member from a different kingdom is added to the defining set We iterated this process until the ideal taxonomic spread was achieved or the information content of the profile dropped below ten amino acid equivalencies 48 Expanding the set of profile homologs Once a profile is built we attempt to find all sequences sharing this sequence domain This is done by heuristic and or exhaustive approaches In the heuristic approach the profile searches BMERC s all genomes and Swiss Prot by filtering the larger databases using BLAST with an expectation value cutoff of E 10 2 followed by a short in long profile search In the exhaustive approach the profile searches the all genomes database or the current version of Swiss Prot using short in long dynamic programming Multiple alignment sets Each profile induces a multiple alignment for any set of proteins that contain it The profiles only align those subregions of a protein that they match These regions incorporate the most conserved amino acid positions among the sequences that make up the profile s defining set We have chosen defining sets that contain the shortest informative protein sequence in order to maximize the chance of producing single domain profile objects A longer sequence in the defining set might make a slightly higher scoring profile by the addition of a few carboxy or amino terminal residues but only at the risk of missing slightly shorter members of the set when the profile is used to search the databases Homologous structures from the Protein Data Bank We routinely search the RCSB Protein Data Bank 49 for potential structural homologs Profile matches with Z scores above 10 are retained and used to align the profile matched region to a structural domain These profile induced structural alignments can be visualized in Rasmol 50 and images built using Molscript 51 and Rasters3D 52 Additional data files The following additional data files are available with this paper online complete alignments
