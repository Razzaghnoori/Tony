 Welcome to SLATE An introduction and apologia By Michael Kinsley The name It means nothing or practically nothing We chose it as an empty vessel into which we can pour meaning We hope SLATE will come to mean good original journalism in this new medium Beyond that who knows Good magazines are exercises in serendipity Credit or blame for the name SLATE by the way goes to David Weld then of Microsoft now of Cognisoft Corp A Seattle cyberwag says that the name SLATE is appropriate because whenever he asks anyone from Microsoft How s your project coming along the answer he usually gets is s late SLATE in fact has been reasonably prompt Less than six months ago it was a four page memorandum and a single Internet naif SLATE is not the first webzine but everyone in this nascent business is still struggling with some pretty basic issues Starting an online magazine is like starting a traditional paper magazine by asking OK you chop down the trees Then what To be honest we are running late on a few things For the reader you there is good news and bad news here The good news is that our billing system isn t ready yet We intend to charge 19 95 a year for SLATE That is far less than the cost of equivalent print magazines because there s no paper printing or postage But 19 95 34 95 for two years is more than zero which is what Web readers are used to paying We believe that expecting readers to share the cost as they do in print is the only way serious journalism on the Web can be self supporting Depending completely on advertisers would not be healthy even if it were possible And we want to be self supporting Indeed one of SLATE s main goals is to demonstrate if we can that the economies of cyberspace make it easier for our kind of journalism to pay for itself Most magazines like SLATE depend on someone s generosity or vanity or misplaced optimism to pay the bills But self supporting journalism is freer journalism As A J Liebling said freedom of the press is for those who own one If the Web can make serious journalism more easily self supporting that is a great gift from technology to democracy For the moment though SLATE is yours for free So enjoy We expect to start requiring registration in a few weeks and to require payment beginning Nov 1 The bad news for readers is that some features aren t quite ready yet Prime among them is The Fray our reader discussion forum Meanwhile though please e mail any comments you may have to slate msn com We ll be publishing a traditional Letters to the Editor page until The Fray is up and running in a few weeks We especially need and appreciate your comments in these early weeks Every new magazine is a beta version for a while especially a new magazine in a new medium SLATE has gotten enormous hype some of it to be sure self induced but much of it not We appreciate the attention But of course it also makes us nervous We have a smaller budget and staff than most well known magazines even smaller than some webzines We don t claim to have all the answers But with your help we plan to have all the answers by Christmas LINK TO TEXT BBB So What s in It First let me urge you to read a special page called Consider Your Options This page explains and executes the various ways you can receive and read SLATE If you don t like reading on a computer screen for example there s a special version of SLATE that you can print out in its entirety reformatted like a traditional print magazine If you don t mind reading on a screen but hate waiting for pages to download and hate running up those online charges from your Internet provider you will soon be able to download the whole magazine at once and read it offline Also on the Consider Your Options page you can order SLATE to be delivered to your computer by e mail Caution This may not work with your e mail system We ll even send you SLATE on Paper a monthly compilation of highlights from SLATE through the U S Mail The cost is 29 a year Call 800 555 4995 to order Individual copies of SLATE on Paper will be available exclusively at Starbucks And selected articles from SLATE will also appear in Time magazine While you re on the Consider Your Options page please read about how to navigate around SLATE We use page numbers like a traditional print magazine and have tried to make it as easy as possible either to flip through the magazine or to and from the Table of Contents OK But What s in It STET double SLATE is basically a weekly Most articles will appear for a week But there will be something new to read almost every day Some elements will change constantly Other elements will appear and be removed throughout the week Every article will indicate when it was posted and when it will be composted As a general rule the Back of the Book containing cultural reviews and commentary will be posted Mondays and Tuesdays the longer Features will be posted Wednesdays and Thursdays and the front of the book Briefing section will be posted Fridays If you miss something you can easily call it up from our archive The Compost THIS NEEDS TO BE A HOT LINK Let me try to describe a typical issue of SLATE The Readme column will not always be as solipsistic as this one It will usually be a commentary on public affairs by one of SLATE s editors Several regular departments in the Briefing section are attempts at meta news the news about the news a sense of how the week s big stories are being played and perceived The Week The Spin takes a dozen or so topics from this week s election campaign developments to the latest big book from Knopf and analyses as objectively LINK TO TEXT CCC as possible the spin they re getting the sub angles that are emerging and so on In Other Magazines uses the covers and contents of Time Newsweek etc as a handy measure of what the culture considers important We aim to have these magazines in SLATE even before they reach the newsstands or your mailbox The Horse Race tracks the presidential candidates like stocks as priced by the opinion polls the pundits and a genuine market in political candidates run out of the University of Iowa Our man William Saletan will compute and analyze changes in the pundits index The Gist by contrast is SLATE s effort to provide a quick education on some current issue in a form as free of spin as possible Also free of quotes anecdotes and other paraphernalia The only 1 000 words you ll have to read when you might rather read nothing at all In a weekly department called Varnish Remover political consultant Robert Shrum will deconstruct a 30 second TV spot from the election campaign You can download a video or audio clip of the spot itself Assessment will be a short judgmental profile of some figure in the news Coming up soon James Fallows on Wired magazine s godfather Nicholas Negroponte Stanford economist Paul Krugman writes The Dismal Scientist a once a month column on economic policy See his debut essay in this issue about the economic war within the Clinton administration University of Rochester economist Steven Landsburg writes monthly on Everyday Economics using economic analysis to illuminate everyday life His first column in our next issue will explain how sexual promiscuity can actually reduce the spread of AIDS The Earthling will be a monthly column by Robert Wright contributor to the New Republic and Time and author of the acclaimed book on evolutionary psychology The Moral Animal Other regular Briefing features will include a Press column by our deputy editor Jack Shafer Doodlennium is our weekly cartoon strip by Mark Alan Stamaty whose Washingtoon appeared for many years in the Washington Post and Time Our SLATE Diary will be an actual daily diary written and posted every weekday by someone with an interesting mind Our first diarist is David O Russell writer and director of Flirting With Disaster Our second diarist will be novelist Muriel Spark Can There Possibly be More Our Features section begins each week with the Committee of Correspondence our e mail discussion group The committee is run by Herbert Stein a former chairman of the president s Council of Economic Advisers best known now for his witty columns in the Wall Street Journal We have great hopes for e mail as a medium of debate that can combine the immediacy of talk television with the intellectual discipline of the written word We hope for something halfway between The McLaughlin Group and the correspondence page of the New York Review of Books Will it work Check out our first attempt Does Microsoft Play Fair and let us know what you think The Features section is also where we run longer articles LINK TO TEXT DDD and occasional humor pieces that is pieces that are intentionally or at least aspirationally humorous This week in The Temptation of Bob Dole SLATE s Washington editor Jodie Allen cruelly analyzes the arguments for a tax cut Social critic Nicholas Lemann writes on Jews in Second Place about what happens to American Jews as Asians replace them at the top of the meritocracy And the legendary recluse Henry David Thoreau emerges to give SLATE readers an exclusive peek at his new Web page In SLATE Gallery we have a continuous exhibition of computer based art You may like or dislike this stuff we ll have plenty of linked commentary to help you decide What appeals to us about computer art is that SLATE can show you not reproductions but the actual art itself We start with an offering by Jenny Holzer This week s reviews include Ann Hulbert s book review of Miss Manners latest encyclical Sarah Kerr s television review of the changing fashions in season finales Larissa MacFarquhar s High Concept column about how managed care could improve psychotherapy and Cullen Murphy s The Good Word about the difference between Jesuitical and Talmudic In general SLATE s Back of the Book will contain a weekly book review alternating television and movie reviews and a rotating menu of columns on music classical and popular sports web sites and other topics Jeffrey Steingarten will be writing monthly on food In the Soup Anne Hollander on fashion Clothes Sense and Margaret Talbot on Men and Women Audio and video clips will be offered where appropriate Every issue will have a poem read aloud by the author with text In this issue is a new poem by Seamus Heaney And coming up soon two additional Back of the Book features an interactive acrostic puzzle and a stock market contest Does SLATE Have a Slant SLATE is owned by Microsoft Corp and that bothers some people Can a giant software company put out a magazine that is free to think for itself All we can say is that Microsoft has made all the right noises on this subject and we look forward to putting the company s hands off commitment to the test But the concern strikes me as misplaced In a day of media conglomerates with myriad daily conflicts of interest Time Warner Rupert Murdoch s News Corp Disney ABC how can it be a bad thing for a new company to begin competing in the media business A journalist who worries about Microsoft putting out a magazine is a journalist with a steady job Readers may also wonder whether SLATE will have a particular political flavor The answer is that we do not set out with any ideological mission or agenda On the other hand we are not committed to any artificial balance of views We will publish articles from various perspectives but we will not agonize if the mix averages out to be somewhere other than dead center LINK TO TEXT EEE A good magazine though does develop a personality an attitude LINK TO TEXT FFF and some prejudices even crotchets A few of SLATE s are already becoming clear In discussing current events we have a preference for policy over politics We d rather discuss the effect of Bob Dole s tax cut proposal on the economy than its effect on Bill Clinton Within the policy arena we seem to have a special fondness for economics This was not planned it s one of those serendipitous developments I mentioned Whether it reflects good luck or bad luck is a matter of taste yours Finally we intend to take a fairly skeptical stance toward the romance and rapidly escalating vanity of cyberspace We do not start out with the smug assumption that the Internet changes the nature of human thought or that all the restraints that society imposes on individuals in real life must melt away in cyberia There is a deadening conformity in the hipness of cyberspace culture in which we don t intend to participate Part of our mission at SLATE will be trying to bring cyberspace down to earth Should be fun Thanks for joining us Michael Kinsley is editor of SLATE TEXT AAA No this is not a link to the Cognisoft home page As a general rule we plan to avoid hyperlinks to outside sites in the text of articles and to group them at the end instead It s a small illustration of our general philosophy better call it a hope that even on the Web some people will want to read articles in the traditional linear fashion i e from beginning to end rather than darting constantly from site to site Go back TEXT BBB Only kidding Easter Go back TEXT CCC Objectivity we hope will distinguish this feature from Newsweek s Conventional Wisdom Watch which is often an effort to set the spin rather than describe it Anyway the CW Watch was a rip off of a similar feature in the New Republic when I was the editor there And TNR s feature itself was lifted from Washington D C s City Paper which was edited at the time of the theft by Jack Shafer now deputy editor of SLATE Go back TEXT DDD Those dread words longer articles raise one of the big uncertainties about this enterprise How long an article will people be willing to read on a computer screen We have several answers to this question 1 We don t know Clearly it s less than on paper but how much less is uncertain 2 We re determined to test the outer limits 3 We ll do our best graphically to make reading on screen a more pleasant experience suggestions welcome 4 We ll also make SLATE as easy as possible to print out 5 This will become less of a problem as screens are developed that can be taken to bed or the bathroom 6 Two thousand words Or at least we re starting optimistically perhaps with the hope that 2000 words or so is not too much By contrast a typical print magazine feature or cover story might run anywhere from 5000 to 15 000 words At least among non cyberheads the computer screen problem seems to be everyone s favorite conversational thrust with regard to SLATE In recent months I ve been amazed to learn of the places and postures in which people like to read magazines Bed and bath are just the beginning At a Seattle dinner party a woman made the interesting point that her problem isn t the screen It s the chair Even ergonomic computer chairs are designed for typing not for reading For this woman and for others who may feel the same way we have asked several furniture designers to sketch a real computer reading chair one you can curl up in with your mouse and your cup of Starbucks and read SLATE online That feature will appear in a week or two Go back TEXT EEE In this regard we are more like the newsmagazines Time Newsweek U S News World Report than the overtly political magazines such as the New Republic National Review or the Weekly Standard Each of the newsmagazines may have an identifiable political tilt But pushing a particular line is not what they are fundamentally about and knowing where they average out won t tell you what any individual article will say Go back TEXT FFF This is different from attitude that free floating supercilious cynicism that is much prized in the culture of cyberspace We may develop an attitude a set of prejudices derived from logic and evidence as best we can determine them but we ll leave attitude to the kids Go back
