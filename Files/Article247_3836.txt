 Rule No 1 Don t Follow All Rules In late September of 1908 the New York Giants and the Chicago Cubs were tied for first place in the National League pennant race with about a week to go in the season This was in the days when there were no divisional playoffs let alone wild cards If you won the regular season title you went to the World Series The two teams met for a game at the Polo Grounds and went to the bottom of the ninth tied 1 1 With two outs and Moose McCormick on first Giants first baseman Fred Merkle singled to right field sending McCormick to third The next batter then lined a single up the middle scoring McCormick with what should have been the winning run and putting New York into first But there was a catch Merkle who was digging hard for second base swerved away he never touched second and started running for the Giants locker room in center field as soon as he saw McCormick touch the plate As was their wont in those less orderly days Giants fans immediately came swarming onto the field when their team won and Merkle wanted to get a head start on the happy mob This then was what s known in baseball as Merkle s Boner Refrain from all vulgar snickers please According to the rules of baseball the game wasn t actually over until Merkle touched second base Cubs second baseman Johnny Evers of Tinkers to Evers to Chance fame realized this tracked down the ball actually people who were there say he got another ball from the dugout since the original ball had disappeared into the crowd grabbed an umpire and stepped on second base which in theory completed a force play on Merkle After much discussion the umpires called Merkle out and declared the game a tie that would have to be replayed A week or so later it was and this time the Cubs won sending themselves to the Series and consigning Merkle to permanent notoriety There s no question that according to the rules as written Merkle did have to touch second base But according to custom in 1908 runners who were on base when a game winning run scored in the ninth tended not to touch the next base and instead headed for their clubhouses A month or so before in a game against Pittsburgh Johnny Evers had tried the very same trick against a Pirate runner who had left the field at game s end but that time the umpire had rejected his appeal In suddenly invoking the letter of the law then the umpires were requiring Merkle to act in a way that he had no reason to believe he was supposed to act The community s understanding of the rule that a runner must always touch the base to which he is forced was that this rule didn t apply when a game was won in the ninth inning What Merkle did then was what the community expected him to do This may not mean he was right to do what he did But there s an argument to be made that when custom systematically changes the meaning of a law in this case changes it by adding an important exception it s a mistake to invoke the original meaning arbitrarily and without warning All of which brings us back to New York City s crackdown last week against people who double park while their streets are being cleaned This form of double parking which is clearly distinguishable from double parking in shopping or business districts is customary throughout the city On my street there s a guy who will double park your car for you and then return it to curbside when the three hour street sweeping period is over It s been understood that double parking is technically illegal but that this is an orderly and systematic community response to the reality that people need a place to put their cars while the streets are being cleaned By descending on selected residential neighborhoods and ticketing all those double parked cars the cops have pulled a Johnny Evers They re just enforcing the law as written But by doing so without notice they re catching people breaking rules that the community had in a sense decided didn t need to be enforced I exaggerate here since the community is the community of car owners And insofar as much of our everyday lives depends on knowing that certain rules count and others don t like laws banning cursing out loud or spitting in public or oral sex Rudy Giuliani is making everyone feel very unsettled Actually though the unannounced war on double parking is not really characteristic of Giuliani Most of his previous Jesuitical initiatives against jaywalking speeding gridlock and the failure to wear seatbelts among others have been announced well in advance so that notice was served that as of a certain date things were going to be different And if you re going to hold people to the letter of the law that seems like the way to do it because it d be hard to have any sympathy for Fred Merkle if before that September game the umpires had told both teams to make sure they touched all the bases in the ninth inning
