 Introduction Although juvenile rheumatoid arthritis JRA is the most common cause of disability in children its etiology is unknown Immune dysregulation appears to play a key pathogenic role as circulating autoantibodies are common in patients with certain JRA clinical subtypes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Two recent studies have shown a highly significant association between early onset pauciarticular JRA and circulating antibodies to the 43 kDa nuclear protein DEK 8 9 Although circulating DEK antibodies have subsequently been found in children and adults with other autoimmune diseases 10 11 these two studies did reveal that children with JRA are significantly more likely to have anti DEK antibodies than are children without rheumatic disease Children with pauciarticular onset JRA were also significantly more likely to have anti DEK antibodies than were children with polyarticular onset or systemic onset JRA or other rheumatic diseases Among children with pauciarticular JRA DEK autoantibodies were significantly more common in those with JRA associated uveitis than in those without eye disease 8 9 DEK reactivity was also found to be strongly associated with onset of any JRA subtype before age 6 years 8 DEK is a nuclear protein that is not structurally related to any known family of proteins 12 13 Although it may also participate in DNA replication and RNA processing 14 15 we have identified DEK as a DNA binding protein that recognizes the TG rich peri ets pets regulatory element in the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 HIV 2 enhancer 16 The pets site is important in mediating HIV 2 enhancer stimulation in activated T cells and monocytes 17 18 19 suggesting that DEK may play an immunomodulatory role as it participates in transcriptional activation through this and related sites Observed sequence similarity between the DEK binding site in HIV 2 and the highly conserved Y box regulatory element in MHC class II gene promoters pointed to the Y box as one possible related site NF Y binding to the MHC class II gene Y box anchors a complex assembly of nuclear proteins that occupies several regulatory elements over a great distance 20 21 22 In the DQA1 promoter Y box a reverse CCAAT motif with a partially overlapping TG rich sequence shares sequence identity with the HIV 2 DEK binding site at 7 of 10 positions Fig 1 In the DQA1 0501 allele which is highly associated with predisposition to autoimmune disease 23 24 25 26 27 the Y box contains a single nucleotide polymorphism that reduces sequence identity to 6 of 10 positions We hypothesized that DEK could bind in a sequence specific manner to the Y box motifs in the promoter regions of several class II MHC genes and that gene and allele specific Y box polymorphisms could affect DEK binding activity In this study we examine the characteristics of DEK binding to the Y box sequences of DQA1 0101 DQA1 0501 DRA DQB and DRB We also confirm participation of DEK with NF Y in the DQA1 Y box binding complex and localize specific DEK binding within this sequence As the Y box promoter element is crucial to the regulation of MHC class II gene expression sequence specific binding to this motif indicates a potential role for DEK in modulating normal and abnormal immune response Materials and methods Cell culture and preparation of nuclear extracts Cultured cell lines were grown and

techniques 16 Results Y box binding activity in nuclear extracts is gene and allele specific The similarity of the DQA1 0101 Y box sequence to the HIV 2 DEK binding site see Fig 1 first led us to investigate whether DEK in nuclear extracts binds to MHC class II Y box regulatory elements in vitro With a double stranded oligonucleotide probe containing the HLA DQA1 0101 Y box sequence EMSAs revealed similar binding activity in nuclear extracts from B lymphoid Namalwa T lymphoid Jurkat CEM monocytoid U937 and HeLa cell lines Fig 2 and in nuclear extracts from SKW 6 4 B lymphoid KG 1 T lymphoid and HL 60 monocytoid cell lines not shown Electrophoretic patterns with a probe corresponding to the DQA1 0501 Y box sequence which diverges from the DQA1 0101 Y box sequence by a single base pair within the highly conserved reverse CCAAT sequence appear to vary with the cell type and binding appears weaker than with the DQA1 0101 probe see Fig 2 Competition EMSAs demonstrated sequence specificity of the DQA1 0101 Y box binding activity Fig 3a Unlabeled DQA1 0101 oligonucleotides successfully competed for strong binding activity seen in nuclear extracts from the Namalwa B cell line Fig 3a lanes 3 and 4 whereas unlabeled DQA1 0501 Y box sequence competed less well Fig 3a lanes 5 and 6 There was no competition when the Y box reverse CCAAT motif was mutated at all five positions Fig 3a lanes 7 and 8 nor with the unrelated HIV 1 B sequence lane 10 DEK has been shown to bind to the HIV 2 pets site 16 but oligonucleotides containing this sequence also failed to compete significantly lane 9 suggesting that factors other than DEK play a role in determining the specificity of this complex In particular NF Y is the predominant nuclear factor binding to the Y box 21 and the HIV 2 pets site does not contain the reverse CCAAT sequence required for NF Y binding The consensus HLA DRA Y box sequence differs from the HLA DQA1 0101 Y box by a single nucleotide immediately 5 of the reverse CCAAT pentamer this single nucleotide polymorphism significantly changes the electrophoretic pattern Fig 3b in comparison with that seen with the HLA DQA1 0101 probe HLA DQA1 0101 oligonucleotide also competes poorly with the consensus Y box probe for binding Fig 3b lanes 5 6 Divergence of the HLA DQA1 0501 Y box sequence at one position within the required NF Y binding site reduces its ability to compete with the DRA Y box probe Fig 3b lanes 7 8 as much as does mutation of all five nucleotides within the CCAAT sequence Fig 3b lanes 9 10 Both DEK and NF Y participate in the HLA DQA1Y box binding complex Participation of both DEK and NF Y in the DQA1 Y box binding complex was confirmed by using high titer anti DEK antiserum gift of W Szer 9 and monoclonal antibody to the NF YA subunit of the Y box binding factor gift of JP Y Ting to further retard the mobility of the DQA1 Y box binding complex supershifting Fig 4 lanes 3 4 Preincubation of Namalwa cell nuclear extracts with antibodies to NF YA also retards the binding complex Fig 4 lane 5 leaving a residual band arrow which can be attributed to distinct DEK binding activity Preincubation with both antibodies results in further retardation of the binding complex to form a doublet Fig 4 lane 6 The same electrophoretic patterns were seen after preincubation of nuclear extracts from the CEM T lymphocytoid cell line with anti DEK and anti NF YA antibodies data not shown Recombinant DEK protein binds in a sequence specific manner to the DQA1Y box but not to the DRA consensus Y box Having established that DEK and NF Y in nuclear extracts participate in the HLA DQA1 0101 binding complex we used recombinant full length DEK rDEK to determine whether it alone can bind to Y box motifs and to examine how gene and allele specific sequence polymorphisms alter its binding The HLA DQA1 0101 Y box sequence does bind rDEK specifically with unlabeled probe sequence competing successfully for binding Fig 5a lanes 4 6 In contrast despite its identity at 9 of 10 positions unlabeled consensus DRA Y box sequence Fig 5a lanes 7 8 competes very poorly against the HLA DQA1 0101 Y box probe DQA1 0501 Y box sequence Fig 5a lanes 9 10 competes only slightly less well than does DQA1 0101 indicating that a change in the residue at position 7 does not prevent rDEK binding Mutation of the reverse CCAAT sequence however eliminates effective competition for binding to the DQA1 0101 Y box sequence Fig 5a lanes 11 12 Taken together these results indicate that substitution of adenine at position 3 in the DQA1 Y box for guanine in the consensus Y box sequence significantly strengthens DEK binding as do bases at positions 5 and 6 in the reverse CCAAT sequence Further characterization of rDEK binding to the polymorphic DQA1 0501 Y box sequence and to the consensus HLA DRA Y box sequence establishes a relative hierarchy of DEK binding activity Fig 5b With the DQA1 0501 probe unlabelled DQA1 0101 sequence Fig 5b lane 3 competed less well than did unlabelled probe DRA Y box sequence Fig 5b lane 4 and CCAAT mutant sequence not shown did not compete for binding Inability of the HLA DRA Y box sequence to compete with the DQA1 0501 probe again indicates the relative importance of the adenine residue immediately 5 to the reverse CCAAT for DEK binding With the DRA Y box sequence as probe Fig 5b lanes 6 10 the unlabelled probe sequence competes less well than do any of the other Y box sequences suggesting that rDEK alone binds to this sequence nonspecifically and with low affinity Quantitative assessment of rDEK binding to related DQ and DR Y box sequences Quantification of the apparent dissociation constant K d app for rDEK binding to related class II MHC Y box motifs validates the relative hierarchy of DEK binding activity described above and further emphasizes the contribution of gene specific Y box polymorphisms to DEK binding activity As shown in Table 1 DEK binds more strongly to Y box sequences in either DQA1 allele than it does to any of the other DR or DQ related Y box sequences It binds least well to the DRA consensus Y box motif with a K d app that is approximately five times that for the DQA1 sequences The K d app for DEK binding to DQB is approximately four times that for the DQA1 sequences whereas the K d app for DEK binding to the DRB Y box sequences especially the DRB alleles associated with the DR4 haplotype are intermediate between the two extremes Once again the A to G substitution at position 3 in the Y box appears to strengthen DEK binding to the DQA1 Y box in comparison with the DRA Y box allelic variation in the nucleotide at position 7 in the Y box sequence as in DQA1 0501 and in the DR4 associated DRB Y box sequence may also mediate subtle differences in DEK binding to otherwise identical sites Gene specific sequence polymorphisms outside the Y box per se could also explain why dissociation constants differ where Y box sequences are identical as in the DQB and DRB consensus motifs Localization of DEK binding within the Y box DNase I footprinting with recombinant protein further defined the physical interaction between DEK and the HLA DQA1 0101 Y box element Fig 6 Using the noncoding strand as probe consistent protection is seen over the G at position 7 which is polymorphic in the DQA1 0501 allele A for G substitution and in the DRB alleles associated with the DR4 haplotype C for G substitution Consistent protection is also seen at position 2 adjacent to the A for G substitution that diverges from the Y box consensus sequence although there is no protection of the divergent base itself at position 3 DNase I protection by recombinant DEK extends over the length of the Y box sequence including bases within the NF Y binding site reverse CCAAT sequence again suggesting that the two proteins may interact Discussion All antigen presenting cells upregulate MHC class II transcription in response to immune stimulation We have previously shown that activation of promyeloid cells causes dephosphorylation of DEK and diminished DEK binding to the HIV 2 long terminal repeat 16 17 32 In this study we show that rDEK can bind to the DQA1 Y box and that DEK in nuclear extracts participates in the DQA1 Y box binding complex in vitro Thus we propose a model in which intracellular signaling modulates the ability of DEK to bind DNA causing alteration of MHC class II transcription Transient transfection experiments in cultured cell lines have not proved useful in examining this model for DEK is highly expressed in most cells of hematopoietic lineage and further overexpression has resulted in apparently nonspecific downregulation of transcriptional activity as might be predicted from 14 For this reason we are currently pursuing other experimental approaches The DQA1 0501 promoter region QAP 4 1 in which a single base pair polymorphism in the Y box significantly diminishes transcriptional activity 33 is a component of the so called susceptibility haplotype for autoimmune disease The DQA1 0501 allele is strongly associated with early onset pauciarticular JRA in Northern European populations 23 24 and with increased risk for juvenile dermatomyositis 25 and Sj gren s syndrome with high autoantibody production 26 27 In our proposed model aberrant class II MHC regulation could result from altered DEK binding and or interaction with NF Y and aberrant class II expression may alter or enhance reactivity against DEK derived or other self peptides The C terminal region of DEK which contains the putative DNA binding domain appears to be most antigenic 34 and K Sitwala and DM Markovitz unpublished observations raising the possibility that altered DNA binding may expose other masked epitopes Development of antibodies to DEK could even be a primary event in the pathogenesis of JRA with disruption of nuclear events due to penetration of anti DEK antibodies into living cells 35 It remains to be determined whether anti DEK antibodies are directly involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease or if they result from generally enhanced immunoreactivity Conclusion Three specific findings in this report support a potential role for DEK as a transcriptional modulator of MHC class II expression One is that DEK binds to the HLA DQA1 Y box in a sequence specific manner Another is that NF Y and DEK both participate in the HLA DQA 0101 Y box binding complex which coordinates DQ protein expression Finally DEK binds differentially to specific Y box sequences found in HLA DQA1 0101 and 0501 alleles and HLA DRA consistent with observations of DQA1 gene specific cell surface expression 36 and allele specific promoter activity 33 The specificity of rDEK binding to these and other related Y box sequences including HLA DQB and HLA DRB alleles associated with the DR4 haplotype may correlate with a predisposition to autoim mune disease seen with certain HLA haplotypes Competing interests None declared Abbreviations bp base pair s EMSA electrophoretic mobility shift assay FLAG Five NH 2 terminally deleted epilope MHC Major histocompatibility complex HIV
