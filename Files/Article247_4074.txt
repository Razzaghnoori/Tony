 Impresario Gates Dear Gerald We re probably more in accord on Africana than not but I think you were too easy on Gates Years ago before blackness became really marketable it used to be said that the publishing industry would admit only one black writer at a time Langston Hughes was succeeded by Richard Wright who in turn was succeeded by James Baldwin A few years ago we thought that notion was disproved when Toni Morrison Alice Walker and Terry McMillan were simultaneously on the bestseller list Then along came Henry Louis Skip Gates Jr He s the modern day impresario of black culture the Joyce Carol Oates of black studies producing with daunting regularity James Brown used to be called the hardest working man in show business but he ain t got nothing on Gates Would somebody puh leeze stop him before he writes again Unlike you I don t labor in the fields of black culture and I m glad though as a fiction writer who keeps hearing rumors that Gates is working on a novel I m constantly checking my rear view mirror for his headlights You guys are in an unenviable place Gates must seem like he s everywhere Still and all I wonder how much of his work will survive and whether in a hundred years say anyone will read anything by Gates in the same way we still read The Souls of Black Folk Oh well At least Gates had the decency not to include himself in his own encyclopedia Or did I miss that entry I wish he d left out bell hooks and Cornel West though two prominent public intellectuals that s what they call people who get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to lecture the rest of us about what we re doing wrong There are biographies of both though thankfully we only have to read about hooks Not so with West He writes a 15 page interpretation of W E B Du Bois I think what interpretation really means is that like Gates West wants to be Du Bois when he grows up But why West and not David Levering Lewis Lewis is an award winning historian not a preacher manqu and though only one volume has been published his is already the standard biography of Du Bois I suppose the explanation is that when you get to be HNIC as Gates has you reward your friends and ignore everyone else Which would explain why there s nothing here on Ward Connerly Stanley Crouch Glenn Loury or Thomas Sowell I couldn t even find anything on black conservatism Of course I d rather have Africana than not but did they have to be so slavishly politically correct and populist There are at least three articles on homosexuality including one titled Homosexuality in Africa An Interpretation there s that word again and the popularization begins on the box with a blurb from Michael Jordan And I thought he was just a basketball player and TV huckster There s an entry on rap music what an oxymoron I suppose you could make an argument that it s a significant enough phenomenon so that it deserves to be here But what s the rationale for separate biographical entries on Queen Latifah Snoop Doggy Dog Tupac Shakur and a host of other dubious thugs And what about Rupaul Why is he here I thought he d already used up his 15 minutes of fame And what would Du Bois have made of that You think black studies has achieved middlebrow status I m less sanguine that many whites feel bad when they don t know something about black history and culture Years ago a white woman told me about how her son s teacher let the class dance to a Michael Jackson record for 10 minutes to celebrate Black History Month And I wonder whether the choice of reviewers here we re both black doesn t say something that makes me uncomfortable and well a little bit angry We ll be closer when we have two white reviewers or a Korean and a Jew Black history in America at least is American history There ought to be room in the retelling of it for the letters Mark Twain and Frederick Douglass exchanged for the similarities between Invisible Man and Ben Franklin s Autobiography for the presence of Charles Chesnutt at the banquet to honor Twain shortly before the latter s death and for the monument in Mississippi to the slaves who rode with a band of Confederate irregulars Sadly I don t find that here David
