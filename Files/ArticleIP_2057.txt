 Dollars and Incense I was prodded into the free lance writer business by the Oct 19 1987 stock market crash Having been employed as a writer at a major media conglomerate for many moons I had collected a substantial stake in the company s profit sharing plan So when the Dow fell 508 points that day and my stake shrank by over 20 percent I was hysterical But then I discovered something quite amazing about my profit sharing plan Its rules stated that when you left the company s employ your share got paid out at the values in effect at the end of the preceding month In other words if I retired by Oct 31 1987 my payoff would be at Sept 30 prices Dazzled by this magical opportunity to sell at pre crash prices I negotiated a contract with my bosses to continue scribbling on a free lance basis and on Nov 1 I became a vendor of various editorial materials The first thing a fellow notices after attaining vendor status is that it is harder to get paid in a timely fashion As a writer employee I had had my paychecks deposited instantly and automatically in my bank account When I became a contract writer I got paid only after somebody initially it was a secretary in the business department put in a requisition for my pay This seemed odd and unnecessarily complicated since my new contract called for me to receive the same amount every month on the first of the month It seemed doubly odd when months came where the secretary forgot to put the requisition through Or alternatively where the secretary put the req through but then couldn t remember whether the blessed event had taken place To be fair there was only one did we pay you this month call But my diary shows endless fretting and nagging on my part as the sixth or the seventh or the 12 th of the month arrived and the check did not The situation improved only marginally when the monthly requisitions ceased and my payment problems were essentially turned over to the corporate Accounts Payable department The payments were still generally late and once not having been paid as of the 12 th I made the unsettling discovery that I had somehow mysteriously dropped out of the AP payment program altogether In the summer of 1989 apparently responding to my endless lamentations about late payments AP started paying me ahead of time i e a few days before the first of the month This was naturally fine with me until I realized late in December that I was now in danger of getting a federal form 1099 showing 13 monthly payments and requiring more taxes sooner So I complained about this prospect and before long we were back to the default situation chronic late payment I do not believe or at least cannot prove that this signifies a cash management play the float strategy by senior accounting executives And yet there is this nagging question Would Accounts Receivable be as relaxed as Accounts Payable plainly is about money regularly changing hands a week or more later than had been contractually specified Speaking of form 1099 I have still not decided what to do about the one I got some weeks back from Slate I had yearned to write for this online journal and was delighted last fall when editor Michael Kinsley gave me a shot at an article It was about the huge losses taken by the Nevada bookmakers on the Holyfield Tyson fight and I was delighted all over again when the article was posted Nov 22 only seven days after I had taken on the assignment How fast it all goes online What a marvelous contrast to the slowpoke print media Except for Microsoft s payment which arrived on Jan 2 1997 in an envelope bearing a Dec 28 1996 postmark The case law says plain as day that this is constructive receipt in 1997 and the question I face is whether a sane person should fight to uphold this principle after the Microsoft business side characters have nonchalantly stuck him with a form 1099 showing those earnings as 1996 income Free lance writers must also deal with a lot of paperwork and printed forms plainly designed with other kinds of vendors in mind These other vendors are not guys sitting alone at home writing articles They are real companies with legal departments and human resources departments And they are equipped to answer questions about the possibility that the enterprise is a small business concern as defined by Section 3 of the Small Business Act to mention only one of many thorny issues raised in a five page form that landed on my desk several weeks ago Leading up to its arrival was a telephone query from an editor of a financial journal that had recently published some of my thoughts on the stock market Did we ever send you the paperwork we need so we can pay you Naively assuming that this would be a request for my mailing address and Social Security number I volunteered to provide this information right then and there on the phone But no the publisher of the financial journal again it was a huge Fortune 500 company needed to know much much more about me A special toughie was the request for my Dun Bradstreet SIC number I assumed at first that this was some variant of the principal business or professional activity code that free lancers are required to enter on federal Schedule C where you report business profits Like thousands of others in my line of work every year at tax time I wrestle with the issue of which four digit number to write in on this schedule the instructions for which mention a huge number of self employment scenarios none of them envisioning a guy creating copy in his den Generally I have ended up choosing No 7880 meaning that I provide other business services which leaves me feeling somewhat marginalized but looks as though it would at least be defensible in a showdown with the IRS But that was my four digit code The D B codes as I ascertained after extensive cruising around on the Internet had eight or in some accounts nine digits and provided much more detailed information about one s place in the economy But how to find out one s number Instructions that came with the form counseled checking with your tax department or an even less realistic option for a fellow needing to get some work done the local office of the Small Business Administration In the end I brazenly sent the form back without any D B code and one of these days I hope to get paid for my musings on the market As a New York City resident I get to pay city income taxes twice It s incredible and it works this way The 1099s one garners during the year are of course cumulated and reported on federal Schedule C then carried over to New York state form IT 201 which takes you through the state and then the city income tax calculations The combined marginal rate for the state and city taxes was recently running around 11 percent which is bad enough But when you have paid it all the New York City Department of Taxation and Finance taps you on a figurative shoulder reminds you that the city also has an Unincorporated Business Tax and states firmly that free lance writers gotta pay this too The UBT covers the same earned income paid to the city on form IT 201 and this time around the bill comes to a flat 4 percent after 10 000 of deductions and exemptions Not one employed journalist in 100 has even heard of this ghastly double dip or experienced the surge of fury I felt when I called up the Authors League in 1987 to ask why they weren t screaming about it The woman I spoke to coolly asked how much I made as a writer judged the amount too high to warrant condolences and said I should be glad to pay my share She was obviously not a vendor
