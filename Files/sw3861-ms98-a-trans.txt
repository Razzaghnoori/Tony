              uh oh are you still there   yes im still here   oh i know what it was the answering machine must have run out of   i i heard something click and i was like oh no it disconnected us   well that no i think i think its on im im so glad i got hold of you i want um something came up at work the other day people are wondering how to choose a college   uhhuh   and i was wondering how what did your parents do to help you choose a college   well to be honest they didnt really do a lot i mean my dad sat me down i guess in junior high and said um that i guess they had called him from the school and you know when they start giving you all those standardized tests and everything and you know Dad said well you know youre a smart kid so youre going to college and youre going to graduate school so decide now what do you want to be  here here are your choices you can be a doctor a lawyer an architect uh he gave me a list of choices all you know       the different professions and i was kind of like i didnt even know you know       i had no clues so i said dad well i cant stand the sight of blood so a doctor is out and uh im not i cant do math so a lot of stuff is out um i didnt think id be a very good architect because i like to draw but not that way so i said well i guess ill be a lawyer because i think they help people       boy was i stupid so Dad said okay fine youre going to be a lawyer so then when it got time to you know get close to you know you start getting college brochures and stuff  my dad kind of said well uh whats the best law school in the country and all his friends told him Harvard and he goes okay well i think you should go there for undergraduate too so i was like okay fine so i like uh send them the uh you know do the what do you call it you know send for the things you fill out and filled out the forms and um they interview you they always have one of their alums interview you and at the time i applied you had to do it through Radcliff because   oh   used to Harvard was for the boys and Radcliff was for the girls   oh yeah   and even though they were combined you know even though they had to let women in Harvard you still had to apply through Radcliff so i did all this and uh a Radcliff alum here in Dallas  did my interview and basically Harvard has a recognized and constitutionally upheld quota system and they told me that i was provisionally accepted but that if that they got a black person or Hispanic person or something that was qualified from this area that i would be bumped because im just a basic you know wasp type person so  im not really   oh   you know they had this minority recruitment thing   hum   so and sure enough about two weeks before school started i found out that they had taken uh they uh found a black girl and uh took her instead so the only thing i could do was i had to go somewhere that you could pretty much register and start the next day so University of Texas was where my dad went to school and luckily its kind of that way so i went down there and late registered and basically started classes the day after i registered   so you got to choose a college twice   yeah by myself   good grief   i mean my parents didnt really you know my dad was the first well my mom they were the first people in their families that had been to college which i know like people from the east coast colleges are all around you you know   yeah   and so everybody goes to college or its more normal i think because a lot of my friends that are from the east coast you know everybody in their familys been to college but out here you know in fact my mother hasnt really been to college college they had a junior college   yeah   that was fairly close by and and so she thats all she ever did was go to junior college   um   just you know two year college and and got her degree but you know then my dad went back to school and finished school and went to professional school   yeah   but that was after my brother and i were already little kids so nobody in my family really knew how to advise me   that was the same way in in my family of course my parents were divorced so it was just mother and my grandparents but one of the key things then was what could we afford to do   oh yeah   and i got a a coop deal at one of the schools in New Mexico and i was there for a couple of years before i flunked out     well where did you go to school in New Mexico   New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology       and that choice   i bet that was neat   yeah it was but men out women numbered the women about twenty or thirty to one   wow     but uh it was just a very small school about three hundred students but the big the reason for choosing it was because of the financial aid that was available   yeah   and it   that is really critical these days i think   yeah yeah but then i my next choice in college was hey i move back with home with mom and i i went to the local university to get my grade point back up   oh yeah   so a decent school would let me in
