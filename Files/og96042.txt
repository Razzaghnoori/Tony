ENCLOSURE ANALYSIS UNDER 5 U S C 801 a 1 B i iv OF A MAJOR RULE ISSUED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ENTITLED FINAL REGULATIONS FOR REVISIONS TO THE FEDERAL TEST PROCEDURE FOR EMISSIONS FROM MOTOR VEHICLES RIN 2060 AE27 i Cost benefit analysis The Environmental Protection Agency EPA has conducted a cost and benefit analysis regarding the final rule which is contained in the Regulatory Impact Analysis EPA used two scenarios in arriving at the estimated cost of test facilities implementing the Supplemental Federal Test Procedure One is the use of air conditioning simulation and the second is for the use of full environmental cells for air conditioning testing The analysis found an annual cost of 198 9 million associated with the simulation scenario or a cost of 13 26 per vehicle Under the full environmental cell scenario the estimated annual cost would be 244 5 million or 16 30 per vehicle These amounts include the cost of recalibration redesign mechanical integrity testing certification durability demonstration annual certification test facility and vehicle hardware The environmental benefits EPA estimates will be a per vehicle lifetime emission reduction of 4 4 pounds of nonmethane hydrocarbons 277 pounds of carbon monoxide and 23 5 pounds of oxides of nitrogen ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 EPA has determined that the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities The automobile manufacturers regulated by the rule do not qualify as small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act Therefore neither an initial nor final regulatory flexibility analysis was performed iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C 1532 1535 Based on the cost benefit analysis performed by EPA the rule will not impose an intergovernmental mandate because there are no enforceable duties on State local GAO OGC 96 42 or tribal governments However the rule will impose a mandate on the private sector in excess of 100 million in any one year EPA has prepared both a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the benefits and costs of the rule in the Regulatory Impact Analysis EPA has considered numerous regulatory alternatives to the final provisions of the rule which are discussed in both the preamble to the final rule and the Regulatory Impact Analysis but has determined that the requirements expressed in the final rule constitute the most cost effective and least burdensome alternative that would meet the mandate of section 206 h of the Clean Air Act iv Other relevant information or requirements under Acts and Executive orders Administrative Procedure Act 5 U S C 551 et seq Instead of the notice and comment procedures in the Administrative Procedure Act the EPA promulgated this rule using the procedures which have similar notice and comment requirements contained in section 307 d of the Clean Air Act as amended 42 U S C 7607 d The use of these procedures regarding rules pertaining to the promulgation or revision of regulations and test procedures for new motor vehicles or engines is mandated by section 307 d 1 K of the Clean Air Act EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on February 7 1995 60 Fed Reg 7404 and conducted a public hearing on April 19 and 20 1995 on the proposed rule The comment period was to close on May 22 1995 but was extended until July 19 1995 because additional time was necessary to gather and analyze data relating to the rule The preamble also notes 61 Fed Reg 54853 that additional comments data and analyses were received after the close of the comment period and that the EPA considered such information in developing test procedures cost estimates and lead time Section 307 d 4 B i permits EPA to put documents in the rulemaking docket after the comment period is over This type of addition to the record after the close of the comment period and the need to reopen the comment period are discussed in Sierra Club v Costle 657 F 2d 298 at 392 400 1981 where the court held such action was not required because there was adequate time for response We have been advised by EPA that the additional comments and data were added to the public docket between August and December 1995 and therefore at least 6 months was available for responses or objections to be filed The preamble to the final rule discusses the comments received and any action taken as a result of the comments Page 2 GAO OGC 96 42 Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U S C 3501 3520 The rule contains information collection requirements which are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act EPA has submitted an Information Collection Request ICR document to the Office of Management and Budget for approval The ICR contains the information required by the Act including the reasons for the collection of the information the type of information and an estimate of the burden imposed on respondents The burden of the requirement testing recordkeeping and reporting requirements is estimated to average 566 hours annually for a typical manufacturer EPA has solicited comments on the proposed information collection requirements to be sent to both EPA and OMB for consideration during the approval process The information collection requirements will not be effective until OMB approval is obtained Statutory authorization for the rule The EPA has cited sections 202 206 208 and 301 of the Clean Air Act as amended 42 U S C 7521 7525 7542 and 7601 In particular section 206 h of the Act 42 U S C 7525 h requires the Administrator of the EPA to review and revise the regulations regarding the testing of motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines to insure that vehicles are tested under circumstances which reflect the actual driving conditions under which motor vehicles are used including conditions relating to fuel temperature acceleration and altitude Executive Order No 12866 OMB reviewed the rule under Executive Order No 12866 as a significant regulatory action The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB approved the final rule as complying with the requirements of the Order based on the information supplied by EPA including a planned regulatory action document describing the reason for the rule and an assessment of the costs and budgetary impact of the rule In its submission EPA did not identify any other statute or executive order imposing procedural requirements relevant to the final rule Page
