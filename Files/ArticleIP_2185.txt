 EDITORIAL A Dangerous Medium Just a reminder A weekly edition of Slate is now available on paper delivered through the U S mail by subscription only for 70 a year Call 800 555 4995 to subscribe We hesitate frankly to offer a paper edition of Slate Why Because paper is a dangerous medium all too prone to misuse by pedophiles political extremists paranoid conspiracy mongers and purveyors of bad casserole recipes Hitler s Mein Kampf was written on paper So were many of Stalin s most bestial orders for mass executions Those of us at Slate who are parents must naturally wonder whether paper should be allowed into a house where young children can read or worse write on it As many newspapers magazines and other timber industry byproducts have pointed out in the wake of the Heaven s Gate mass suicide Slate s preferred medium of the Internet has some darker byways of its own That s true But this anti Internet alarmism is a heavy handed attempt to distract attention from the really dangerous medium paper J accuse Quis custodiet ipsos custodes Et cetera The earliest users of paper were ancient Egyptians with their bizarre worship of the Sun God Ra A distant relation perhaps of the Heaven s Gate cult leaders Do and Ti In the modern era the practice of writing on paper was first taken up and monopolized for centuries by Christian monks all of whom had taken vows of celibacy Even today reading paper products is a lonely habit whose practitioners often spend hours or even days at a time silently and obsessively turning pages immersed in a world of fantasy isolated from normal society No wonder some of them lose all grip on reality Charles Manson was a known book reader So was Attila the Hun according to his former political consultant Dick Morris Yet society ignored the clues until it was too late Mere words cannot describe the vast range of content now available on paper Much of this to be sure is harmless nonsense such as the installation instructions that come with popular software products But paper is by far the favorite medium of pornographers Ransom notes use paper as well Several years ago a scientific journal published instructions for building a nuclear bomb Where On paper In a culture where Internet reality is dismissed as virtual the appearance of words on paper lends them instant credibility credibility that may not be deserved An irresponsible rumor can be set in type and then printed and distributed by the millions with no guarantee whatsoever of its accuracy And yet people say I only know what I read in the papers At best paper s materiality creates an unjustified impression of trustworthiness at worst paper can be folded into an airplane that can poke someone s eye out Paper poses a special peril to children Unlike a computer a filthy magazine can easily be snuck into the house in an innocent looking lunchbox It can be hidden under a pile of sweat clothes in the bottom dresser drawer Any page can be folded placed in a pocket and secretly transported or shared with other children Books can even be read by flashlight in bed long after Dad has requisitioned the family computer and is trying to log on to AOL naively believing that junior is safe from corruption just because he is tucked in and offline It is fine to say that parents are responsible for what their children read But no parent can realistically patrol a child s access to paper It s everywhere even at the library and other taxpayer supported institutions Rating systems do not exist Filtering software is not available What is the moral The first moral is that children are never safer than when staring at a computer screen At least you know they re not reading a book or anything Second government regulation of paper is clearly needed We look to Congress for a Paper Decency Act to close the giant loophole left open when last year s Communications Decency Act was limited to electronic media Third the recent ruling of the United States Parole Board forbidding paroled federal prisoners to use the Internet must be extended to forbid books magazines and newspapers as well Corrupting influences are everywhere Finally read Slate online Or subscribe free to our e mail edition If you must use paper please do so with extreme caution Thank you Correction The Gist Zaire posted Saturday March 22 now in The Compost inaccurately identified Paul Kagam as president of Rwanda He is vice president and defense minister The mistake has been corrected in the archived article but as is our policy we note the error here for purposes of self flagellation Michael Kinsley
