 Heart of Glass The New Northwest s distinguishing feature isn t rain or money or coffee It s Chihuly Not Dale Chihuly Not glass art by Dale Chihuly Chihuly is all you need to say whether you re talking about a particular glass piece a Chihuly or evoking the movement the institution the aesthetic and the regional identity epitomized by the Northwest s and the glass world s most famous artist Not since Bernini decked Rome with fountains or at least not since the Wyeths became Maine s official art family has an artist so exemplified the spirit of a city or region and it took three generations of Wyeths Chihuly s work doesn t say anything outright about us but he s the best mirror we ve got for divining what we ve come to today A little background with apologies to anyone who lives here and already knows it all Dale Chihuly is the artist celebrity who gets most of the credit for elevating glass blowing from one more craft to a bona fide and wildly popular and lucrative art form He grew up in Tacoma Seattle s soporific little sister city and headed first back East and then to Venice to study in the emerging studio glass movement In 1972 on a tree farm north of Seattle he founded the Pilchuck Glass School which made that movement an institution even as he turned it into an industry Try as we may we can t escape the glass Chihuly makes or rather has others make the lurid Venetians writhing sea forms and extravagant candleless chandeliers resembling giant wasps nests or clusters of water filled condoms The loftiest galleries and living rooms out here have their Chihuly bowls the crasser tourist galleries stock copycats To gain Seattle credibility the apartment set in the sitcom Frasier sprouted one No new cultural palace or festival shopping experience is complete without a Chihuly click if you think I m exaggerating Seattle s new symphony hall boasts two Chihuly chandeliers Chihuly himself is just as much a fixture as his Chihulys especially in of the Seattle Times gossip column Sample While a tour of the Chihuly studio is standard for celebrities Bono did it one better He tried his hand at glass blowing The Seattle Opera commissioned a set in Mylar from Chihuly Only Leonardo da Vinci and King Tut have topped the attendance record set by Chihuly at the Seattle Art Museum The first project Paul Allen picked for his new film company was a study of artists inspirations including you guessed it But the ultimate confirmation of Chihuly s stature is the lottery hometown artists stage to mock Seattle s star struck provincialism and celebrity fawning The winner gets to smash a Chihuly But Seattle still lags behind its erstwhile rival Tacoma in Chihuly mania For Tacoma glass is a last chance at world stature Its grandest landmark the Neo Baroque Union Station has been renovated and reopened as a Chihuly showcase with the mother of all chandeliers in its atrium and more big pieces scattered around This is just the warm up to the International Glass Museum originally the Chihuly Glass Center being built on Tacoma s waterfront reached by a 474 foot Chihuly Bridge of Glass Tacoma s captains of industry and finance all ponied up for it As one of them told the Times Every downtown needs a niche Chihuly is the natural choice for Tacoma and not just because he s a native son His is the perfect art for boosters wannabes new money and self conscious arrivistes In other words perfect for the precociously wealthy culturally callow New Northwest Glass has the museum seal of approval but it s supremely and as practiced by Chihuly almost purely decorative blissfully unburdened with threatening ambiguous or other meanings You don t have to be smart or art historically sophisticated to understand these a Chihuly s assistant explains in one of several documentaries on him by Seattle s public TV station They re merely beautiful Forget Sister Wendy and her gloomy paintings glass shimmering and vacant is the ideal TV art a match for Riverdance and the tenors Glass also suits a money drunk technology intoxicated place like the Northwest It s showy and luxurious as glittery as jewelry and a hundred times bigger It s hard slick and literally edgy At the same time Chihuly taps an earlier earthier ecotopic sensibility His forms evoke not only phalli and vaginas but sea squirts and anemones the marine biosphere that sustained the first Northwesterners which we still delude ourselves into thinking we re sustaining His baskets mimic Native American basketry outright The implicit if wishful message We can have our machines and money and preserve the wild unspoiled Northwest But beautiful Chihulys are just part of the Chihuly phenomenon Chihuly himself is the main show With his rampant curls bluff growl black eye patch and bright colored pirate shirts and scarves he s the perfect foil to geek chic a year round version of the Seafair Pirates who frolic at our big summer parade the artist for the new buccaneer capitalism the jester who amuses but never challenges the geeks He reprises the Renaissance role of artist as courtier standing like a third senator onstage when President Clinton visits partying on Paul Allen s yacht with Robin Williams Candice Bergen and of course Bill and Melinda Gates This year when Gates hosted his annual CEO Summit the world s most celebrated gathering of tycoons who provided the entertainment The Vienna Philharmonic and with an exhibition of glass blowing art Dale Chihuly Not that he blows glass himself though he still says things like this from the 1994 book Chihuly Baskets Glass blowing is a very spontaneous medium and its suits me I ve been at it for thirty years and am as infatuated as when I blew my first bubble Chihuly hasn t actually blown since 1976 when an auto accident cost him an eye and his depth perception and made his career He acquired the trademark dashing eye patch without which he d be just another chubby little guy with frizzy hair And he hired other people including top Italian masters to blow more glass than he could alone enough to make him the Christo of glass decking Northwest streams and you ve gotta admire the chutzpah Venetian canals with bright globes and tubes The Eye Patched One has gone far and so has this town How far Consider the other time 50 years ago that Seattle had a distinctive defining artistic tradition and not one but two celebrity artists Morris Graves Mark Tobey and others in the generation later dubbed Northwest visionaries drank deep of both the drizzly mossy natural scene and of Asian art and philosophy Tobey sketched spinach hawkers and bums at the downtown Pike Place Public Market and was sometimes mistaken for one Graves hid out in the deep woods Tobey painted calligraphic white paintings and Graves bodhisattva birds in delicate gouache and pastel media notably unsuited to large atriums Today these seem as quaint as hand bound books or handwritten letters Chihuly succeeds because he s not a maker of art in the usual sense he s a coach ringmaster and impresario and above all an entrepreneur No one expects entrepreneurs to do the production work No one argues anymore over whether Gates is really a techie or worries about Jeff Bezos literary taste And no one cares whether Chihuly blows glass Like Seattle s software bookselling and coffee tycoons Chihuly has triumphed by marketing and branding the hell out of his product elevating it to something at once precious and ubiquitous The Northwest trick is not so much to create something out of nothing as making something very large out of something small and then repeating the process A hundred million PCs a billion personalized book and CD sales a zillion cups of coffee or hundreds of chandeliers made of brittle blades of glass Which is after all just melted silicon
