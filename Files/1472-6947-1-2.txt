 Background With the rising trend towards consumerism in health patients are increasingly encouraged to become involved in making decisions about their health Marketing campaigns for prescription drugs are now being directed towards patients with advertisements appearing in the popular press suggesting that patients discuss medications and treatment options with their doctors A recent study examining the effect of drug advertisements on consumer behavior found that 19 of study participants asked for a prescription and 35 asked a physician for information about a drug after seeing a drug advertisement 1 In order for patients to be effective participants in the decision making process they need information on the effects of treatment on their health risks that they can use to make health care decisions The challenge to clinicians is how to present risk information to patients that they can use in a format that they prefer Several studies have examined how presentation 2 3 4 wording 5 and framing 6 7 affect physicians interpretations of numeric data as well as their willingness to initiate treatment 8 However few studies have examined the effect on patients of framing risk data with different metrics such as relative or absolute risk and the number needed to treat NNT Relative risk describes the ratio of the risk of disease in one group compared to that in another and does not take into consideration a person s baseline risk Absolute risk describes the difference between the risks of disease in two populations and varies according to baseline risk A derivative of absolute risk is the NNT with a specific therapy to prevent one adverse outcome the inverse of the difference in absolute risk Framing the benefits of treatment in relative rather than absolute terms may emphasize the short term benefits of a treatment 6 9 Conversely framing the risks of treatment in relative rather than absolute terms may emphasize its risks 10 Comparing relative and absolute risk reduction and NNT as methods to inform patients about preventive therapies Hux et al illustrated that the metric used to present data can affect a patient s perception of a therapy s effectiveness 11 In addition to consideration of which metric is used to describe risks the time horizon over which risks or benefits occur may affect risk interpretation Typically risks framed in relative terms are not explicit about the time frame involved and may be erroneously interpreted as accruing immediately On the other hand risks framed in absolute terms or as the NNT tend to report a specific time frame and hence may be interpreted as being delayed in onset In addition to issues related to comprehension patients may prefer to have risks presented over specific time periods While most framing studies focused on a treatment s effect on a single outcome over a single time horizon patients often need to decide on treatments that affect multiple outcomes both beneficial and harmful For example the decision of whether or not to use hormone replacement therapy HRT after menopause involves weighing the benefits of treatment immediate symptom relief 12 decreased future risk of hip fracture 13 and possible decreased risk of coronary heart disease 14 15 against its risks increased future risk of breast cancer 15 Framing effects appear to be smaller when both the beneficial and harmful effects of a treatment are included 16 but little information is available to guide clinicians about how to explain complex risk information to their patients Most studies exploring risk communication and decision making have focused on the use of different metrics However data can be described using a variety of different graphical formats as well Survival curves are commonly used in the scientific literature and can also be used to help patients understand risk information when deciding between two treatments 2 Figures using 100 faces or ovals to represent populations with and without a condition displayed in a random 17 or consolidated 18 fashion have gained increasing popularity in the lay press as have simple bar charts The choice of graphical formats may affect patient performance on cognitive tests 19 20 21 22 23 accuracy of comprehension and speed of processing probabilistic information Vertical bars horizontal bars numbers and 100 consolidated ovals performed better than either pie charts or 100 random ovals when testing simplified cognitive tasks e g identifying the larger of two quantities 24 The type of visual graphic used to present information can also introduce bias in risk perception with risk perceived to be less when using a bar graph versus a stick figure 25 Numerous criteria have been used to evaluate graphical formats including clarity helpfulness 26 27 accuracy and efficiency 24 though these criteria may not necessarily be those of greatest importance to patients themselves Although it is unclear which criteria should be used to evaluate formats to use with patients patient preferences may be an important consideration Formats preferred by patients may reflect higher perceived relevance familiarity usefulness usability and meaningfulness and hence may be more successful in engaging their attention The aim of this study is to determine patient preferences for the presentation of complex benefit risk information describing the impact of treatment on multiple clinical outcomes over multiple time horizons including preferences for graphic format time horizons multiple outcomes comparisons and metrics The specific example tested was deciding on HRT among a population of peri and postmenopausal women Methods Graphic format We identified the following graphic formats as being the most commonly used in the scientific and popular press and therefore the most recognizable to patients bar graphs line graphs thermometer graphs 100 representative faces displayed in a consolidated fashion and survival curves Figures 1 2 The survival curve was atypical in that its y axis presented a patient s chance of not developing a disease instead of the more standard chance of survival This modification was made to keep the data presented consistent with data presented in the other graphical formats since survival was not presented in the other graphs the chance of not developing a disease is the closest equivalent to survival which is the chance of not dying Pie charts were not included because this format did not readily lend itself to describing risks over time Participants were sequentially presented with all graphic formats and each was briefly explained Participants were asked to rate how much they liked each graph on a likert scale of 1 to 5 with 1 corresponding to not at all and 5 corresponding to extremely and then to rank order the graphs according to preference Time horizons Participants were also asked to rank order their preferences for risk estimates over 10 year 20 year or lifetime horizons presented using bar graphs predicting a woman s risk for developing heart disease hip fracture and breast cancer Multiple Outcomes Participants preferences for risk displays about multiple clinical outcomes were elicited by asking participants to choose between 2 sets of 3 graphs In Set A each of three diseases was displayed separately over 3 time horizons Figure 3 In Set B the same three diseases were displayed together over one time horizon this was repeated for the other two time horizons Figure 4 Note that the exact same data were presented in each set differing only in format Metrics Preferences for absolute vs relative risk estimates were obtained by asking participants to choose between risk estimates for heart disease framed in either absolute or relative terms both graphically and textually Finally participants evaluated the concept of NNT presented with two written explanations The first explanation referred to as 1 in x was worded If 8 women just like you took lifelong HRT it would prevent one of the 8 from having heart disease If 9 women took lifelong HRT it would prevent one of the 9 from having a hip fracture If 17 women took lifelong HRT it would cause one of the 17 to develop breast cancer There is no way of knowing in advance who these women might be The alternative explanation referred to as x out of 100 was worded If 100 women just like you were to take lifelong HRT treatment would prevent 12 of them from developing heart disease and 11 of them from developing a hip fracture However treatment would cause 6 of them to develop breast cancer There is no way of knowing in advance who these women might be We assessed differences in patients preferences between the two graphs with the highest mean rating using a Wilcoxon signed rank test Descriptive statistics were performed on subgroups stratified according to race Caucasian vs non Caucasian annual household income 50 000 vs 50 000 and education 2 years college vs 2 years college Statistical comparisons within subgroups were not performed due to the small sample size Results Study participants included a diverse group of 40 peri and post menopausal women Table 1 Half of our sample identified themselves as non Caucasian All participants had at least some high school education most 60 had an annual household income of less than 50 000 The mean preference rating for the bar graph exceeded those of the four other graphs in this set Table 2 Most respondents 83 ranked the bar graph as being their first or second most preferred graph with more than half of all respondents 60 selecting the bar graph as their first choice Figure 5 The bar graph was consistently rated highest when the sample population was stratified according to race income and educational status Sub group analyses are shown in Table 2 recognizing that these analyses are limited considering the small sample size Most respondents preferred receiving risk estimates over multiple time horizons vs at one time point When asked to prioritize a majority preferred receiving lifetime risk estimates instead of 10 or 20 year time horizons Table 3a There was no clear preference for the type of presentation comparing risks for multiple disease outcomes over different time horizons Table 3b Respondents preferred risk estimates framed in absolute rather than relative terms for both graphical and textual displays Table 3c this finding was consistent across racial income and educational sub groups Participants consistently stated that they wanted graphical and textual explanations of absolute risks provided together In describing NNT respondents preferred the written explanation which rescaled data from 1 in x to x out of 100 Table 3d Discussion Limitations The present study included a small self selected population of women who were more likely to be interested in health related activities Our sample size was small because focus groups and 1 on 1 interviews were originally conducted to discuss HRT and decision making issues When convergence was reached on these broader topics we ceased recruitment and analyzed data from these respondents While these results may not be generalizable to all women our sample included a diverse group of women with respect to race income and educational background Recognizing that focus group discussions might lead to group think we control for this by asking participants to privately write down their personal preferences before they were discussed A formal analysis of patient comprehension for each presentation format was beyond the scope of the present study however data on this topic has been previously reported 24 While responses from focus group participants reflected how well they felt they could understand the information in various formats no formal testing of comprehension was performed Analyzing comprehension of each format at this stage was not feasible considering the additional time burden it would have imposed on our study participants focus group sessions lasted a full 2 hours Presentation formats that are not understandable may be misinterpreted formats that are unappealing may be ignored Therefore future studies might test both comprehension and patient preferences simultaneously to develop future risk communication tools The graphical presentations utilized were hypothetical in that they did not present each individual s personal risk estimates but those of a theoretical woman It is unlikely that patients preferences for risk estimate presentations would have been different had they been shown their own risk estimates Not all possible graph types were presented to study participants although we attempted to include the most common graph types from the scientific and popular press Although we did not systematically study the reasons for participants stated preferences participants were asked open ended questions to understand these preferences Finally since scientific literature traditionally presents 5 year survival data it might be difficult to compare our data based on 10 year 20 year and lifetime horizons to that in the current literature Conclusions Patients preferred health risks to be framed in absolute terms using bar graphs and calculated over their expected lifetime There was no clear preference for presenting a treatment s effect on multiple outcomes The NNT is not an easily understood concept for patients but if used to discuss multiple outcomes it should be re scaled to x out of 100 The results of these analyses should help physicians present risk benefit information to patients in a clear and useful manner Competing interests None
