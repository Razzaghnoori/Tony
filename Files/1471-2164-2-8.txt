 Background The proper assembly of basic proteins with nucleic acids such as occurs in the packaging of histones with DNA to produce chromatin and in the packaging of ribosomal proteins with rRNA to form ribosomes is a reaction that must be facilitated so as to prevent the aggregation of these oppositely charged groups of molecules Proteins that mediate these reactions generally termed molecular or nuclear chaperones have been identified biochemically Two well studied proteins that participate in the processes of chromatin and ribosome assembly are nucleoplasmin and nucleophosmin respectively two related proteins whose characteristic acidic domains have been shown to bind the basic proteins involved in these processes and present them to the nucleic acid Nucleoplasmin is the most abundant protein in the Xenopus oocyte nucleus and is the protein for which the term molecular chaperone was coined due to its multiple roles in the assembly of nucleosomes during early frog development 1 Nucleoplasmin forms a pentamer and its stretches of acidic residues bind to histone H2A and H2B In concert with the unrelated acidic protein N1 N2 which binds histones H3 and H4 they act together and with other factors to assemble nucleosomes 2 3 In addition to assembly nucleoplasmin and other proteins are involved in the chromatin remodeling and nucleosome disassembly that occurs for example during transcription to allow the access of transcription factors to nucleosomal DNA 4 Another major function of nucleoplasmin is the decondensation of sperm chromatin at fertilization In this case nucleoplasmin acts to exchange the sperm specific basic proteins which allow the dense packing of DNA in sperm with the histones H2A and H2B thus effecting chromatin decondensation 5 6 Phosphorylation of nucleoplasmin appears to be important in regulating this activity as heavily phosphorylated nucleoplasmin is significantly more active 7 Nucleophosmin also called B23 8 NO38 9 or numatrin 10 a protein related to nucleoplasmin is implicated in ribosome assembly due to its abundance localization in the nucleolus and its multiple activities that are consistent with such a function Some of these activities include nucleic acid binding 11 ribonuclease activity for processing preribosomal RNA 12 and association with maturing preribosomal ribonucleoprotein particles 13 14 It may also be involved in the transport of ribosomal or other nucleosomal proteins across the nuclear membrane as it is known to shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus and to stimulate the nuclear importation of proteins 15 16 Nucleophosmin also appears to be intimately involved in centrosome duplication It associates specifically with unduplicated centrosomes and its phosphorylation by CDK 2 cyclin E the trigger for centrosome duplication is required for duplication to occur 17 The nucleophosmin gene is also known for its fusion with the anaplastic lymphoma kinase ALK receptor tyrosine kinase in cases of this disease with 2 5 p23 q35 translocations 18 The nucleophosmin portion contributes to transformation by providing a dimerization domain which allows activation of the fused kinase and signal transduction 19 We previously discovered and initially characterized a novel member of this family in the mouse namely nucleophosmin nucleoplasmin 3 Npm3 To identify the human ortholog of Npm3 and begin its characterization we have cloned a human NPM3 cDNA determined its genomic structure and relationship to other family members and show its expression in multiple tissues and subcellular localization in the nucleus Results and Discussion NPM3cDNA cloning and genomic structure Mouse Npm3 is located approximately 5 kb upstream of the Fgf8 gene in the same transcriptional orientation 20 21 To determine if human NPM3 is similarly located and to identify genomic clones of NPM3 we analyzed FGF8 containing human genomic lambda clones 22 by Southern blotting using a mouse Npm3 cDNA probe A 4 3 kb Hin d III Xho I fragment that hybridized to Npm3 was identified subcloned and used to screen a human liver cDNA library Several partial cDNAs with strong sequence homology to mouse Npm3 were isolated The 5 coding region was subsequently isolated using a reverse transcriptase PCR approach and was fused to one of the partial cDNAs at a common restriction site to produce a cDNA with full coding potential Sequencing of subcloned genomic fragments and comparison with the cDNA sequence allowed us to construct an exon map of the NPM3 gene Figure 1A NPM3 has the same exon structure as the mouse ortholog and is located approximately 5 5 kb upstream of FGF8 in the same transcriptional orientation Figure 1B The NPM3 exon intron boundaries and organization information is presented in Table 1 Based on its close linkage to FGF8 NPM3 maps to chromosome 10q24 26 23 24 NPM3sequence analysis The amino acid sequence deduced from the human NPM3 cDNA sequence was 87 identical and 95 similar to mouse Npm3 Figure 2 The human sequence is three amino acids longer than that of the mouse these additional residues lie in the acidic domain in the C terminal portion of the protein At least eight potential serine and threonine phosphorylation sites are present in the human protein involving such kinases as casein kinase I and II protein kinase A and C glycogen synthase kinase 3 and calmodulin dependent protein kinase II Figure 2 All of these consensus sites are also found in mouse Npm3 with the exception of the casein kinase I site at residue 16 A cluster of amino acids at the C terminus that is rich in basic residues and glycines forms a potential nuclear localization signal 25 26 in the human as well as the mouse protein Figure 2 Multiple phosphorylation sites and nuclear localization signals or the ability to bind proteins with such signals are also characteristics of nucleophosmin and nucleoplasmin 16 27 28 29 When the functions of NPM3 are elucidated it will be of interest to determine the contribution of phosphorylation to these activities since the functions of both nucleoplasmin and nucleophosmin are regulated by phosphorylation which is extensive in both proteins 7 17 To enable an amino acid comparison between NPM3 with other members of the nucleophosmin nucleoplasmin family we searched the nonredundant GenBank database using human NPM3 Xenopus nucleoplasmin and human nucleophosmin as BLASTP queries and 11 additional full length proteins were retrieved Table 2 An amino acid comparison of NPM3 with these other members of the nucleophosmin nucleoplasmin family from various metazoans reveals extensive sequence identities and similarities throughout all of NPM3 except the C terminal 16 residues Figure 3 All members of this family have a core region of relatively close similarity in the N terminal half of the proteins C terminal to this region all have one or more acidic domains consisting of a total of 17 to more than 100 aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues per molecule These two residues can comprise more than 25 of the total amino acids in some proteins of this family in NPM3 they make up approximately 18 of the residues The N terminal core region of high similarity between family members correlates to a region in nucleophosmin B23 that has been shown to be involved in oligomerization as well as chaperone activity 44 A central portion between nucleophosmin s two acidic domains is required for ribonuclease activity 44 this region does not have a corresponding domain in either NPM3 or nucleoplasmin suggesting that these proteins would lack such activity A nucleic acid binding domain in the C terminus of nucleophosmin is also lacking in NPM3 and nucleoplasmin but the known functions of nucleoplasmin in nucleosome assembly and sperm decondensation suggest that this protein and possibly NPM3 can accomplish intermolecular reactions involving nucleic acids in other ways perhaps by associating with other proteins that have this binding activity Indeed NO29 a Xenopus protein with significant similarity to NPM3 is found to associate with NO38 the Xenopus ortholog of mammalian nucleophosmin 43 To gain further insight into the relationship of NPM3 with the other known members of this family we used CLUSTAL W and TreeTop 45 to produce a dendrogram of these relationships Figure 4 In this analysis we included the 14 proteins from Figure 3together with two other histone binding proteins that are unrelated to this family These two proteins Xenopus N1 N2 36 and human NASP nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein 41 are closely related to each other and may be orthologs 46 This analysis shows that NPM3 is more closely related to NO29 and the nucleoplasmins from Xenopus than to the nucleophosmins from multiple species No nucleoplasmin ortholog in humans has been reported to date and our screening of GenBank has not detected such a sequence The relationship between N1 N2 and NASP can be seen in this dendrogram and appears similar in closeness to that of NPM3 and NO29 The kinship of NPM3 and NO29 is supported by recent GenBank screens with the NPM3 amino acid sequence as a TBLASTN query against the entire nonredundant GenBank database which resulted in NO29 sequences as the best non NPM3 match and vice versa Although other genomic and functional studies would be required to prove an orthologous relationship between NPM3 and NO29 they appear by several analyses to share a relatively close evolutionary history and as such could be considered candidate orthologs NPM3 expression in human tissues We examined the expression of NPM3 in 16 human tissues by Northern blot analysis Figure 5 Abundant and relatively equal expression of NPM3 was found in all tissues with the highest levels relative to actin in pancreas and testis and the lowest in lung Previous analysis of Npm3 expression in mouse tissues also showed generally equal and strong expression in the tissues tested with especially strong expression in testis 21 However in the mouse the brain rather than the lung displayed the lowest Npm3 RNA levels Nevertheless the widespread and relatively strong expression of the gene in both species suggests that the protein has a fundamental function s in cells of many if not all tissues The apparently ubiquitous expression and abundant levels of NPM3 RNA are consistent with other members of this gene family and with a proposed role as a molecular chaperone NPM3 protein localizes to the nucleus All of the nucleophosmin and nucleoplasmin homologs that have been studied to date are localized in the nucleus To allow a determination of the subcellular localization of the NPM3 protein we tagged the protein at its N terminus with a hemagglutinin HA epitope We then expressed this protein in NIH3T3 cells fractionated the cells into nuclear cytoplasmic and extracellular culture medium fractions and analyzed these by immunoblotting using an anti HA antibody This analysis revealed that NPM3 was localized only in the nuclear fraction Figure 6 The NPM3 protein migrated in SDS PAGE gels as a doublet with apparent molecular masses of 25 and 27 kDa which are larger than the 20 5 kDa mass predicted by the deduced amino acid sequence including the HA tag Similarly other members of the nucleophosmin nucleoplasmin family also migrate more slowly than expected Xenopus NO29 migrates at 29 kDa versus the expected 20 kDa 44 Xenopus NO38 migrates at 38 kDa versus the expected 33 5 kDa 9 and Xenopus nucleoplasmin migrates at 38 kDa rather than 33 5 kDa 9 The slower migration is likely primarily due to an electrophoretic anomaly reflecting the amino acid composition although phosphorylation or other modifications could conceivably contribute Supporting this notion the in vitro transcription translation of a plasmid encoding the closely related NO29 protein produces a product presumably unmodified with slow mobility that is similar to the mobility of NO29 extracted from cells 43 The smaller sized polypeptide of the NPM3 doublet is probably a degradation product as is observed in analyses of the NO29 protein 43 This subcellular localization of NPM3 together with the other results here suggests that this protein is a molecular chaperone with functions in the nucleus Conclusions The striking similarities in amino acid sequence and domain structure between NPM3 and its chaperone relatives nucleophosmin and nucleoplasmin together with abundant expression levels and nuclear localization strongly suggests that NPM3 shares fundamental nuclear chaperone functions with these proteins It will be important in future work to refine these results and test for example whether NPM3 may have chromatin or ribosome assembly functions that are similar or complementary to nucleoplasmin or nucleophosmin or whether it may have completely independent functions Materials and methods Isolation of NPM3genomic probes We digested previously isolated lambda genomic clones of the human FGF8 region 22 with restriction endonucleases Promega Madison WI and analyzed them by Southern blotting using a mouse Npm3 cDNA 21 probe as previously described 20 An 8 4 kb Xho I fragment from these clones that hybridized to the probe was subcloned into pBluescript Stratagene for analysis Deletion of non Npm3 sequences from this clone resulted in a 4 3 kb Hin d III
