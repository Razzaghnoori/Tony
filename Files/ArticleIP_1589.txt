 For Better or for Worse In one of Bob Dole s worst hours his wife Elizabeth follows her brilliant performance at the Republican Convention with a warm well filmed 30 second appeal on his behalf The spot called Elizabeth was produced by Alex Castellanos He s Jesse Helms ex media man and this ad proves that his style surely does change with his client Normally a spouse s endorsement spot doesn t do much beyond making a candidate feel good If your wife or husband isn t for you who is But Elizabeth Dole s poll ratings and communication skills decisively exceed her husband s In fact Republican pollster Frank Luntz reports that his focus groups of voters show that the convention bounce was for Elizabeth not Bob Dole Visually the spot creates the sense of a one on one conversation between each viewer and the appealing woman in the soft yellow suit who s sitting casually in what appears to be her living room The smooth slow camera movement through the spot imparts a degree of visual variety without disturbing the intimate mood The surface simplicity of the scene belies the sheer weight of the spot s message Elizabeth attempts to make three separate points all of them critical to the Dole campaign The would be first lady first vouches for her husband s integrity and by implication points to the contrast with Bill Clinton The spot is intentionally ladylike a positive oasis in a desert of attack ads on both sides But it too is intended to be negative phrases like doing what s right and living up to his word play off much surveyed voter doubts about the president s character Elizabeth next tries to deal with one of Dole s central political weaknesses a gender gap that leaves him as much as 25 or 30 points behind among women So this woman successful in her own right and except for her politics a poster woman for the Ms Generation tells us that her husband has strong commitments on domestic violence and equal retirement benefits for women But the spot doesn t linger here It moves swiftly and smoothly to Dole s most fundamental problem his loss of credibility on the tax issue In part because his campaign ads dealt in drugs and character in the weeks after the Republican Convention voters increasingly bought into the Democratic definitions of the 15 percent tax cut that it s probably phony and almost certainly wouldn t happen even if Dole got elected Elizabeth reminds us that Bob Dole does what he does because it s right another JFK line straight out of the inaugural address Here the line tweaks our now collective memory of Dole s war service and suggests that he wouldn t propose the tax cut simply because it was easy or politic You can count on it we hear straight from Elizabeth because it s right for America s families Does this really reassure us It helps After all would this lady lie to us And we know she s too smart to be fooled Just for insurance she returns to the implicit comparison with Clinton Bob Dole doesn t make promises he can t keep Elizabeth argues that we can trust Dole more or at least distrust him less The sharpness of the message woven through the softness of the image recalls Carl Sandburg s description of someone as a steel fist in a velvet glove This spot concludes with footage of the empty Kansas prairie the place Bob Dole comes from where as he said in his acceptance speech a man is very small against the sky Dole the picture says again is from the heartland the land of plain virtue and truth telling The empty sky here leaves room for the words he wants people to decide are true Bob Dole will cut our taxes This last scene is curiously disconnected from the preceding conversation with our friend Elizabeth Despite the ad maker s intention the viewer may decide that the winding two lane road of the scene leads only to Dole s bridge to the past But whatever the outcome the spot artfully and literally puts the best face on a tough sale Robert Shrum
