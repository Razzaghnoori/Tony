 Arch how are you doing tonight good and yourself oh that yeah fine kind of tired yeah me too where am i calling pardon me where are you i m in Lewisville Lewisville okay i m in Garland um have you read anything about how they propose to uh come up with the taxes to increase the funding for schools little bit what do you think about it equalization of funding that s a hard issue to decide uh on the one hand you don t want to have to take away but on the other hand you don t want uh the poorer school districts to go under either and uh here in Lewisville they had a thing on the ballot that they wanted to uh rollback the taxes on everybody s houses and everybody would save uh huh uh twenty dollars a year or whatever but it would cut back twenty million dollars in to the schools and i happened to know a good teacher here in the school district and she was really against it because that would just take away all all their money um hum and as far as i m concerned you know hey twenty bucks a year is not too much to me and they could raise a few more dollars and get better uh things for the schools that s what we need because we got you know Texas is known for it s poor schools and that s too bad because we got little kids and we re uh not too pleased about that but we re not funding them like other states either though you know it we re not funding our schools like other states either pardon me that s true that s right but just because we ve got a lot of money doesn t mean that s gonna solve the problem yeah i know that s that s only part of the problem i mean i think there s a lot of waste in in schools i m a teacher i feel that yes i feel i definitely feel that way all this money that s being paid for administrators i think we re gonna see are you okay i think were gonna see a day come yeah hum um i can i think i think we re gonna see a day when schools uh grade schools are gonna be charging tuition just like colleges are uh and it ll only be to those who are having kids going to school that s probably the most fair way but you know uh that way old people don t have to have have money going to the schools because they don t have little kids going to schools but uh i wouldn t be surprised if that happens within the next few years uh that sort of thing happening and uh we ll see what happens well they re already talking about freedom of choice you know for schools that s an idea yeah yes um i don t know that i think has pluses and minuses because uh those that are economically disadvantaged won t have the ability to make a choice the choice will be thrust upon them and so where s the freedom of choice no freedom of choice in that case and that s that s true but like in Garland you can choose the school that you re going to can you tell this is past bedtime um like in Garland they get to choose the schools that they re gonna go to but they got to have the transportation to them if it s out of their district you know out of their area i mean yes so and i like that because you can find out the good schools in your area yes i think the only way they re gonna really get to the problem and solve it is to have equal funding for every school in the state whether you it s in a poor tax district or a high tax district and uh that s the only way that i can see it s gonna be resolved is there are gonna be people in the rich district that are gonna fight that and and it s gonna be a real bad mess because there s people on every side of the problem so just distribute it equally and not raise taxes yeah and they should give every teacher a a hundred percent raise that that s the problem is the teachers don t get enough money and anybody who could be a good teacher doesn t want to become a teacher usually because they don t pay enough i mean when i was in college i did a lot of teaching uh for my degree and uh i got a lot of good out of that and i liked teaching but i really couldn t go into teaching because it was not economically feasible for me to do so yeah what do you do i m a mathematician oh so you picked a good field then you picked a good field pardon me oh i don t know there are better fields to pick well yeah but that s not a bad one i mean yeah where i you know kind of stuff i do i i use my education quite a bit but where i was before i wasn t using it hardly at all so it all depends i mean it depends on where you wind up i guess but i really enjoyed teaching it you know i but wouldn t mind getting back into it someday but who knows what ll happen in the future the way people are being laid off right and left it s all a matter of uh what happens next but uh back back to the taxes though i mean uh it s a difficult issue no one wants their taxes raised but on the other hand you got to do something yeah what do you think about a state income tax i can see that there might be a reason for one but i would hate to do that because uh that would be very difficult for my family financially to to afford a state income tax and most states have it i know and i ve lived in states that have had it but way uh way financing is now if we had a state income tax i d uh have a very hard time financing my house again you know paying off my mortgage each month that s so that s a problem um which just matter of we ll see what happens i d rather have that i guess than have a state state lottery because when you bring but didn t they pass that thing that we were gonna have a lottery or not no it didn t oh which means there s a higher probability of now having a state income tax even though good old tax and spend Annie my favorite uh decided that uh during the campaign she said we weren t gonna have a state income tax and now she s gonna renege on that which i expected her to do anyway uh we ll see what happens i don t know at any rate uh so what about your income tax think they re hitting you too hard actually no um no i m surprised that my uh my income taxes are as low as they are we just finished our income taxes and we re getting a nice little refund back this year which is which is nicer than having to pay out uh which is a matter of uh um i m surprised it s well considering the national budget i think George Bush wanted one point four trillion dollars for the national budget and for a family of four like what i got that comes out to over twenty two thousand dollars that we it it s our share to pay in but i m not paying that much income tax huh uh and you re gonna think well wait now where s the other eighteen thousand dollars or whatever coming in where how how is that coming from me i guess it comes from companies and businesses and whatnot but it s interesting i don t know i can t imagine i guess that s why we re going in debt so deeply they bring in half a trillion dollars and they spend one point four and then the rest goes to to the national debt which just keeps accumulating i don t know what else do you think about them let s see the state that s about it i guess and the city tax the sale tax they used to you really didn t even think anything about it when you bought something but now you do it figures in what is it seven p oint yeah yeah seven percent or something it depends on where you re at some places in Dallas i guess it s like closer to eight and places like in Lewisville it s a lot closer to seven i don t even know how they figure it really i m glad i don t work in a store hum um how s that because i wouldn t want to have to figure this seven point something percent i guess they ve got a little table though and it s all written out oh yes so it wouldn t be so bad all right so you think that s the way to do it federal tax is okay state tax you can see the logic of it but you don t think it would be economically feasible for your family and ours see both of us are teachers and we got four in our family too no yeah we don t need anymore and so when you start taking talking taking more out of your paycheck to go to the state income tax uh but we can do this tax sheltered annuity that s the only thing that s saving us yeah i think what we need what uh the government the state government needs to do is get in there and cut spending because when they got all this fraud and waste going on they need to just get in there and and get out the garbage that s in there right now i mean i once heard that uh uh for the for the federal government at least that if they uh uh well for like on the welfare system if they gave all that money directly to the people every welfare recipient would be making like forty five thousand dollars a year and you know they re not making that much money they re making probably more like five or six on the welfare so where s the other ninety percent going well it s going to the some fat guy in the middle who s sitting there on his behind all day doing nothing but filling out papers part lots and lots of people before they get it lots of people yeah yeah but still i work in southeast Dallas and a lot of my children are from poor you know socioeconomic areas homes and it s just like they always have money they they always are dressed nice you know most of them are fairly nice not like you would think a a poor person would be yeah and i mean they ve always got dessert money or they ve always got you know dollars on them and everything and i m thinking you know this isn t right because my children don t have that yeah well i don t have that a lot of times if i ve got a dollar in my wallet it s like boy where do i go where did where d i find that yeah and you give them you know they get their free lunch and they throw most of it away but then they have their money to go buy dessert and that they eat wow you know it s just you see garbage pans i mean pails just filled and we pay people to haul them off right yeah right and the like a guy does it and he has his own pigs quite a quite a world we live in that he yeah it is oh well is that you got anything else to say i don t think i do oh well yeah that s all i have to say thank you okay well talk talk to you later then bye um hum bye
