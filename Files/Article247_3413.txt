 George W s Rise Hillary s Fall ELLEN My family and I returned last night from a week in Bermuda where I managed to pick up a bad sunburn watch my 6 year old boogie board in the Atlantic and make sure my younger son didn t get swallowed by the undertow My wife and I managed one night without the boys going to a country club dinner with my brother and his wife which was remarkable only for the dazzling array of photos on the walls One in particular of a undoubtedly re touched Churchill when he visited the mostly golfing facility in the early 50s was very striking Another change of pace for me was the lack of cable TV save CNN and the stateside dailies not being delivered until about 5 in the afternoon Which was kind of cool You d get the meaningless Times fax with breakfast but then read the Times Wall Street Journal New York Post and Boston Globe before falling asleep After days in the sun and the arduous exercise of building sand castles and going swimming it made me less angry at the morons who staff the daily papers But here s a question Where have all the fact checkers gone One of my hobbyhorses is that the vast majority of dailies and magazines are overstaffed by at least 50 percent there s a problem with unions for you and still the quality overall is poor especially in comparison with the upmarket British dailies For example in a sidebar to the letters section in today s Time magazine an editor wrote Several people pointed out that while John F Kennedy uttered the phrase Ask not what you can do in his Inaugural Address in 1962 Now of course the date was 61 and you d think one of the scores of editors and editorial assistants and assistants to editorial assistants could ve snared that mistake We run a small shop at NYPress and make mistakes as every publication does but I find it inexcusable that large media organizations are rife with errors every day Today s New York Times has a teaser on the front page With Straw Vote In Some Hint of a Race that says Gov George W Bush really has a contest on his hands You don t have to guess who wrote the story inside Richard Berke perhaps the most biased beat political reporter in the United States In fact it was a decisive win for Bush and the Forbes camp which outspent Bush considerably was privately disappointed by the outcome hoping to either defeat the governor or come within a few percentage points Unless some catastrophic scandal is revealed and drug use doesn t come close to alleged rape and illegal campaign contributions but don t get me started Bush will be the nominee The Times which must be apoplectic that Gore is on the ropes will do everything in its power from pictures to captions to editorials to stop Bush Which is fine I just wish they d declare themselves as partisan as say the Guardian or Telegraph in London do I may be going on too long but one more thought I read in the New York Post this morning about the Clinton family s house hunting in Westchester I don t believe Hillary Clinton will wind up running She ll be creamed meaning by 6 or 7 points by Giuliani and I suspect she ll end the campaign sometime in December I think the final blow ironically was the tragic death of John Kennedy Jr It pointed out that Hillary isn t a New Yorker and that liberals and moderates would ve far preferred Kennedy as a candidate I think eventually RFK Jr a solid New York citizen or Andrew Cuomo will run Personally I d love to see Charlie Rangel go against the Mayor That would be entertaining politics More later Best RUSS
