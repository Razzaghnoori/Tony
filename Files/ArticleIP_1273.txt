released trilogy s official Web site City of Industry Orion Pictures Director John Irvin s Widows Peak City of Industry is praised for not being a hyperstylized Tarantinoesque crime movie Its deadpan attitude and traditional plot thieves heist jewelry and then double cross one another are said to hark back to classic film noir What s refreshing and even sort of charming about this thriller is that it s so obviously the work of diehards of talented traditionalists who are dedicated to taking care of business Terrence Rafferty The New Yorker Also lauded the cast which features Timothy Hutton Stephen Dorff and Harvey Keitel and the movie s refusal to glamorize the criminal life Orion serves up stills and clips on its site Opera Jackie O Houston Opera Studio Mixed reviews for a campy rock opera about Jackie Onassis ascent to iconhood The Washington Post s Carl Cunningham says it s a mindless 100 minute cult fantasy a third of the opera is set at a 1968 New York loft party where the first lady schmoozes with Maria Callas Grace Kelly and Andy Warhol Newsweek extols the poetic libretto by Wayne Koestenbaum author of Jackie Under My Skin Interpreting An Icon as well as its brilliantly eclectic score and its general irreverence Jackie is played by Nicole Heaston who is short stout and African American Theater Antony and Cleopatra Joseph Papp Public Theater New York The New York Times Ben Brantley calls this production of the Shakespeare play directed by Vanessa Redgrave jaw droppingly bizarre Redgrave s portrayal of the queen of the Nile as an aging cigarillo smoking ditz obsequious to Antony is judged daffy but charming except by New York s John Simon who wishes Redgrave would be seductively womanly Critics are skeptical of anachronistic touches in the production including loud sirens camcorders and video projections of political speeches Newsday s Linda Winer calls Redgrave s decision to play Antony s suicide scene as a joke unforgivable The Public Theater site plugs the play Books Arkansas Three Novellas by David Leavitt Houghton Mifflin Co Reviews of Leavitt s collection of novellas focus on the first The Term Paper Artist which caused a scandal when Esquire pulled it at the last minute The fiction editor quit claiming the editor in chief had been afraid that Leavitt s explicit gay sex scenes would alienate advertisers The New York Times Michiko Kakutani says that Leavitt s take on sex is adolescent and does nothing to illuminate its heroes lives Others find the collection uneven The Term Paper Artist does earn some praise though for its playful reference to another crisis in Leavitt s life the British poet Stephen Spender s allegation that Leavitt plagiarized Spender s memoirs in an earlier novel Deadly Feasts Tracking the Secrets of a Terrifying New Plague by Richard Rhodes Simon Schuster A history of mad cow disease by veteran science writer Richard Rhodes The Making of the Atomic Bomb Critics praise Rhodes lucid explication of complex virology as well as his range the book includes digressions on political and literary themes and a section on the scandal surrounding a Nobel Prize winning expert on the disease who recently pleaded guilty to molesting a little boy The book is said to degenerate into a jeremiad when Rhodes anoints mad cow disease the new Black Death Resurrection The Struggle for a New Russia by David Remnick Random House New Yorker writer Remnick s sequel to his Pulitzer Prize winning Lenin s Tomb is a compelling postscript Walter Laqueur Los Angeles Times Reviewers focus on Remnick s access to political insiders especially his extended interviews with Mikhail Gorbachev Vladimir Zhirinovsky and Gennady Zyuganov Critics also welcome his ambivalence on Russia s future Unlike most Russia watchers Mr Remnick does not manage his material so as to prove that Russia is bound to succeed or doomed to fail the Economist The Three Arched Bridge by Ismail Kadare translated by John Hodgson Arcade High praise for a newly translated 1981 novel by Albanian author Kadare about a medieval village at the dawn of capitalism Translated into prose of crystalline clarity and grace it is a slim dark tale that bears some kinship to J M Coetzee s Waiting for the Barbarians Patrick McGrath New York Times Book Review High praise also for Kadare a perennial nominee for the Nobel Prize The New York Times says his defection to the West in 1990 helped topple Albania s Communist regime However the Weekly Standard attacks the author calling him an apologist for dictator Enver Hoxha Albania

Harrison is making it all up Mrs Harrison has written a failed that is to say an unconvincing memoir For all we know she did all these things and more Any speculations to the contrary would be
