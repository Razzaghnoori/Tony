 Domestic Goddess Dethroned Roseanne s final episode will air Wednesday night but the Hollywood press machine which operates on the principle that no one who earns 21 million a year can be all bad is cheerfully toasting its star s bright future The theme We haven t heard the last from her Roseanne it is said will become a serious movie actress a best selling author a standard bearer of feminist populism Her current role the Wicked Witch in a theatrical production of The Wizard of Oz will make her a Broadway star Well here s an alternative prediction We have heard the last from Roseanne And if we haven t we ll soon wish that we had TV critics at least the political minded ones opine gravely that Roseanne s cancellation proves that a complacent America has lost its appetite for real life blue collar characters that all TV viewers want now are 3 rd Rock From the Sun aliens and Seinfeld yuppies This is wrong Roseanne s cancellation proves that America has lost its appetite for a real life blue collar character played by a spoiled Hollywood brat By making it Roseanne destroyed the very thing that defined her not making it Once upon a time Roseanne mattered She understood what it meant to be lumpenproletariat and made it her life s project to explain this outsiderness to America She did it brilliantly Between its 1988 launch and 1993 Roseanne ranked among the three highest rated shows on television It transcended demographics The working class folks whose lives Roseanne claimed to depict tuned in So did wealthier viewers to whom the show represented blue collar chic Roseanne was not only television s most popular sitcom it was also its best except perhaps for The Simpsons As Roseanne Conner Roseanne turned the pain of poverty into comedy exposed the absurdities of family life and punctured the egos of bosses and politicians Like All in the Family and no show since Roseanne gave life and warmth to the ugly the fat the poor It was social criticism of the best sort a tonic to the Family Ties The Cosby Show pablum of the Reagan Bush years Roseanne Conner became a genuine populist icon an anti June Cleaver for a downsized era Roseanne Barr became an icon too In 1989 she made more magazine covers than anyone in history Several years later The New Yorker invited her to guest edit its women s issue But her celebrity depended on a fiction that the TV character was in fact the actress For a while she was Like her TV namesake Roseanne was trailer trash She was a former waitress and prostitute who had lived in squalid poverty with a ne er do well husband and three kids She had street credibility Roseanne assured her fans that Hollywood could not change her She and her second husband Tom Arnold himself a former meatpacker built themselves a mansion in Iowa to escape the L A phonies Arnold proudly described the pair as America s worst nightmare white trash with money You could take the girl out of the trailer but you couldn t take the trailer out of the girl But of course everything changed though Roseanne herself did not seem to recognize it She went Hollywood in the worst possible way The Domestic Goddess became just another prima donna She and Arnold divorced by tabloid She tyrannized her co workers throwing fits firing writers at will terrorizing her underlings Roseanne is notorious as the worst workplace in television She publicly accused her parents of abusing her and her sister they denied it She followed Madonna s lead by dropping her last name She married her security guard perhaps Hollywood s hoariest clich She underwent repeated plastic surgeries in order to reduce her breasts smooth her wrinkles slim her face alarmingly she looks younger in the ninth season of Roseanne than she did in the first She stopped telling interviewers about anal sex and started talking about her deep spiritualism and her study of mystical Judaism In short she became a parody of celebrity indulging in every whim of the Hollywood overclass Fame did more than make Roseanne grotesque it also untethered her from the Domestic Goddess the one idea that made the show great the only good idea she s ever had as one acquaintance puts it She could no longer portray a convincing Roseanne Conner largely because she no longer had any connection to Roseanne Conner s world In its last few seasons the show lost its grounding in reality Plastic surgery made Roseanne Conner look less like a haggard mom than like well a TV star who s had a lot of plastic surgery Roseanne used to tackle issues like homosexuality or race relations with grace e g Roseanne s lesbian kiss with Mariel Hemingway But recently the show has succumbed to ludicrous ratings pandering gimmicks e g Roseanne s mom s emergence from the closet During this final season Roseanne attempted the most desperate plot device of them all She had her TV family win 108 million in the lottery replicating her own rags to riches story What few shreds of real life credibility remained after that plot twist were destroyed by cameos from C grade celebrities Tammy Faye Messner Marlo Thomas Moon Unit Zappa and lame parodies of Xena Warrior Princess Rambo Roseambo the episode was titled and I Dream of Jeannie TV husband John Goodman who d grown sick of the show and Roseanne was all but written out of the plot The audience melted away Once a top 10 regular Roseanne fell to 14 th place in 1995 and 32 nd in 1996 It may finish as low as 40 th this season What may be saddest about Roseanne s decline is that the show won t leave the legacy Roseanne intended for it It didn t usher in a golden age of real life sitcoms It didn t open the airwaves to blue collar characters Its single accomplishment if it can be called such is that it legitimized the stand up comedian as sitcom star from Roseanne to Seinfeld to Ellen Not that Roseanne needs your sympathy She s earned 40 million in the last two years making her the second highest paid woman in show business after Oprah Syndication revenues will guarantee her millions for years She is about to launch her own TV talk show Don t be surprised when it flops She s spent the last nine years talking on television She seems to have nothing left to say
