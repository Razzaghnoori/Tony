 Mahir and the Diaper Clad Chat Room Denizens Dear Todd Yesterday in the letter you filed at about noon you said I see that Mahir has finally made Time magazine My first impulse was to write back Who s Mahir but I felt incredibly stupid for not knowing who Mahir was which lead me to assume that he had to be either a famous sports guy pick a sport any sport or someone connected to the opera or the ballet Then for a second I thought there was a typo involved and you were actually speaking of Maher as in Bill from Politically Incorrect But I couldn t imagine out why he mattered to you so much that you were gleefully remarking on his inclusion in Time Not wanting to own up to being either ignorant or unhip I never said a word even though I still wanted to in my first letter this morning Instead I quietly typed his name into a search engine and found out everything I needed to know And I only mention this because I now realize that no way was I the only person who had no idea to whom you were referring yesterday Which of course was kind of a relief Moving on to weightier matters Did you read that Michael Jackson is set to star as Edgar Allen Poe in a new movie The racial discrepancy of this casting choice doesn t bother me nearly as much as the fact that portraying Edgar Allen Poe as a guy with a high pitched breathless voice who has had a ton of plastic surgery would put such a completely different spin on what might have been the psychological issues behind the writing of those scary twisted stories that it just might be impossible to ever really enjoy them again It s almost like hiring Richard Simmons to play Ernest Hemingway in A Moveable Feast Although now that I think about it more I would do almost anything for a chance to see that movie made Apparently a new study of children s media habits just released by the Kaiser Family Foundation reveals that children between 2 and 18 spend about five and a half hours a day consuming media mostly TV But as I was analyzing the figures I noticed that the 32 percent of the kids between 2 and 7 who have a TV right in their very own bedrooms watch an average of only three hours nine minutes daily In other words as I see it the more central the TV is to their world the less they want anything to do with it This is something I have long suspected as I have found there is no more effective way to get someone to cut back on their TV viewing than to put them front and center on a TV show And if you give them a job in the writing department they may just decide to never even own TV again period I don t know how the statistics fall as far as the homeless and TV viewing but according to the front page of the L A Times they are spending a lot more time online The article reports that hundreds of homeless shelters across the country have installed computer labs that would be the envy of most high schools I guess just because a person doesn t have a permanent address is no reason they shouldn t be allowed to give themselves a wacky pseudonym and log on to a chat room full of adult men in diapers like everyone else But I have friends who keep telling me that online dating is the answer And as far as I am concerned this is the final nail in the coffin of online dating for me because I am not meeting anyone for coffee at a homeless shelter Period I don t care how single and sensitive they otherwise appear to be You know yesterday when I was snooping around at Monica Lewinsky s new cyber handbag emporium I found myself wondering how she had turned into a handbag designer simply by sitting around eating fists full of clairs at the Watergate and then making crosstown limo rides to the courthouse for grand jury appearances But today I noticed that Bloomingdale s is running a quarter page ad in the front section of the New York Times that says Meet Designer Shoshanna at Bloomingdale s Nov 20 12 4 It features a photo of one time teen age girlfriend of Jerry Seinfeld s Shoshanna Lonstein posing in her own holiday creation a garnet self striped strapless silk taffeta dress 255 What I conclude from this is that apparently surviving a controversial and highly publicized affair with a famous male public figure confers upon a woman not just symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder but also a functioning set of designer skills and abilities equivalent to a four year bachelor of arts degree Which means I think we can all look forward to at least a line of whimsical scarves or belts from Marla Maples or Patricia Duff by the end of the year Did you read that Italian scientists discovered a gene that exerts major control over the life span of mice This is considered a milestone in research concerning anti aging And I suppose even if they never find the corresponding gene in humans it will still make us all feel younger at heart to be around so many younger looking mice
