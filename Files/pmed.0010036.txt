 Introduction The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy HAART can dramatically prolong the life of individuals infected by human immunodeficiency virus 1 HIV 1 1 but early hopes for virus eradication have not been realized 2 The successful use of HAART is limited by drug related toxicities high costs and drug resistance 3 factors which have led to the development of alternative therapeutic strategies including the use of supervised or structured treatment interruption STI This approach involving recurrent limited exposure to autologous virus has not been successful in chronic infection 4 5 but has been shown to lead to at least transient containment of viremia after intervention in the acute phase of infection in humans and animals exposed to AIDS associated retroviruses 6 7 8 9 In the present study we performed a detailed longitudinal assessment of the impact of early treatment followed by STIs in patients treated during acute or early HIV 1 infection The main hypothesis of the study was that early treatment of acute HIV 1 infection followed by STI would lead to immune boosting and subsequent control of viremia without the need for drugs The primary endpoint was the time to viral rebound above 50 000 copies ml once or above 5 000 copies for three determinations separated by a week each The early results of this trial were previously reported showing that five of eight patients were able to achieve a plasma viral load of 500 copies ml or less at a median of 6 mo off therapy 6 The current study investigates the frequency and durability of control achieved with this intervention with follow up to a median of 5 3 y after infection and with an increase in size of the cohort to 14 patients Our results indicate that although the majority of patients treated in the acute phase of infection go on to control HIV 1 to less than 5 000 RNA copies ml plasma for at least 6 mo off therapy the ability to contain viremia below this level over the long term is maintained in a minority of patients Methods Objective The hypothesis of the study was that early treatment of acute HIV 1 infection would confer immunologic maturation and subsequent control of HIV 1 without the need for ongoing drug therapy Alternatively if a breakthrough of virus replication was observed this would provide a boost in HIV 1 specific immunity after reinstitution of antiviral therapy The primary endpoint was the time to viral rebound to more than 50 000 copies ml or viral loads above 5 000 copies ml for three determinations separated by a week each The secondary objective was to correlate immunologic and virologic parameters with any observed effects including evolution of HIV 1 specific T helper and cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses The original study protocol including the patient consent form and the institutional review board approval can be found in Protocols S1 S4 Study Population Fourteen patients presenting with acute or early HIV 1 infection were enrolled in this study between July 1997 and January 2000 Table 1 Acute HIV 1 infection was defined by the presence of HIV 1 RNA in the plasma a negative or weakly positive HIV 1 antibody by HIV 1 2 ELISA and the detection of no more than three bands in an HIV 1 Western blot early HIV 1 infection was defined by a positive ELISA and confirmation of early infection by either detuned negative ELISA or previously known negative ELISA All participants in the study had symptoms compatible with the acute retroviral syndrome and were treated with HAART one protease inhibitor and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors within a median of 19 d range 9 33 from the onset of symptoms Study participants were recruited from the Massachusetts General Hospital the Brigham and Women s Hospital and the Fenway Community Heath Care Center in Boston All individuals gave written informed consent to participate and the study was approved by the respective institutional review boards and conducted in accordance with the human experimentation guidelines of the Massachusetts General Hospital Six of the 14 individuals were investigated in an interim study 10 These patients were AC 02 AS2 in 10 AC 05 AS5 AC 14 AS1 AC 15 AS3 AC 25 AS6 and AC 46 AS4 STIs Entry criteria included treatment with HAART before or shortly after HIV 1 seroconversion viral suppression on HAART to less than 400 RNA copies ml for 2 mo HIV 1 viral load at the time of entry into the study of less than 50 RNA copies ml and lack of significant mutations conferring drug resistance 11 12 Lymphocyte proliferative response to recombinant HIV 1 p24 protein had to exceed a stimulation index of ten before treatment discontinuation and net counts per minute had to be 800 or greater All antiretroviral drugs were discontinued simultaneously After a treatment interruption patients were seen at least once a week for the first 24 wk and then monthly with a total of at least 30 visits for the first year after cessation of therapy In the second year visits continued monthly Treatment was restarted if viral load remained above 5 000 RNA copies ml plasma for greater than three consecutive weeks or was in excess of 50 000 copies ml on any single occasion Human Leukocyte Antigen Typing High and intermediate resolution human leukocyte antigen class I typing was performed at a commercial laboratory Dynal Biotech Oxford United Kingdom by sequence specific PCR as described 13 Detection of GB Virus C RNA GB virus C GBV C RNA was detected using a two step nested PCR amplification reaction from whole plasma RNA Briefly GBV C RNA was extracted from plasma using the Qiagen Viral RNA Mini Kit Qiagen Valencia California United States according to the manufacturer s instructions Extracted RNA was reverse transcribed using the Qiagen OneStep RT PCR Kit and amplified by nested PCR in both steps primers specific for the 5 UTR of GBV C were used as described previously 14 Chemokine Receptor Genotyping In order to analyze the chemokine receptor CCR 5 32 deletion polymorphism the region spanning the 32 nt deletion was amplified by PCR and the two alleles were separated by gel electrophoresis 15 The CCR2 64I polymorphism was detected by PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis as described previously 16 Synthetic HIV 1 Peptides We synthesized 410 synthetic peptides 15 20 amino acids long at the Massachusetts General Hospital Peptide Core Facility on an automated peptide synthesizer using Fmoc technology as described 17 Peptides overlapped by 10 amino acids and spanned the entire HIV 1 clade B 2001 consensus sequence ELISPOT Assays ELISPOT assays were carried out as described previously 18 Peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs were incubated overnight at 50 000 to 100 000 cells well in 96 well polyvinylidene plates that had been precoated with 0 5 g ml anti human interferon monoclonal antibody Mabtech Stockholm Sweden The final concentration of the peptide per well was 14 g ml The numbers of spots per well were counted using an automated ELISPOT plate reader AID EliSpot reader system Autoimmune Diagnostika Strassberg Germany A response was considered positive if there were more than 50 spot forming cells SFCs 10 6 PBMCs and if the well had at least three times the mean number of SFCs in the three control wells The dependence of responses on CD8 T cells was determined by measuring the depletion of CD4 T cells using the Minimacs cell depletion system Miltenyi Biotec Bergisch Gladbach Germany When HIV 1 specific CD8 T cell responses were detected against adjacent peptides and therefore might represent targeting of the overlap region responses to the weaker peptide were excluded for calculations of magnitude and breadth as previously described 19 Proliferation Assays Freshly isolated PBMCs 10 5 cells were incubated with baculovirus derived recombinant p24 protein Protein Sciences Meriden Connecticut United States at 5 g ml for 6 d and then pulsed with 3 H thymidine at 1 0 Ci for 6 h before harvesting as previously described 20 A stimulation index of five or greater was considered significant Statistical Analysis Time to failure during the different treatment interruptions was assessed by Kaplan Meier analysis Patients who were still controlling viremia at the time of last visit who failed because they restarted therapy without meeting the criteria of virologic failure or who were lost in follow up were included in the analyses but the data were censored at the last evaluable time point Equality of survival distributions for the first and second treatment discontinuations was evaluated using the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed ranks test CD4 T cell losses were calculated on regression lines based on least squares fit A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for the analysis of continuous variables such as days following onset of symptoms CD4 T cell count HIV viral load and time to rebound of viremia as well as for the estimation of hazard ratios for the categorical variables of ELISA Western Blot coreceptor polymorphism and GBV C status Statistical analyses of CD8 and CD4 T cell responses were based on a Student s t test a multiparametric ANOVA test a Wilcoxon matched pairs signed ranks test or a Mann Whitney U test as indicated p values lower than 0 05 were considered to indicate statistical significance and all reported p values are two sided Statistical analysis and graphical presentation were performed using SPSS SAS and Prism software packages Results Longitudinal Assessment of Control of Viremia following Treated Acute or Early Infection Fourteen patients identified at the time of acute or early infection Table 1 Figure 1 were entered into this protocol and they were followed for a median of 5 3 y from the time of infection range 494 2 475 d Patients underwent successive treatment interruptions after an initial treatment period of at least 8 mo median 508 d range 245 1 096 d and were required to restart therapy when viral load exceeded 50 000 RNA copies ml plasma on a single occasion or 5 000 copies ml for three consecutive weeks For purposes of analysis patients who dropped out of the study or who reinitiated therapy without meeting criteria were considered to have lost the ability to contain viremia Using these criteria for reinitiation of therapy and to define failure 11 of 14 patients 79 were able to achieve virologic control to less than 5 000 RNA copies ml plasma for at least 90 d after one two or three treatment interruptions Table 2 The period of longest containment was after one interruption for five patients after two interruptions for eight patients and after three interruptions for one patient Table 3 Once control was achieved the majority of the patients experienced a subsequent rise in viremia The median time between cessation of therapy and rebound of viremia having a viral load greater than 50 copies ml was 17 d range 7 169 d Six of 14 patients 43 achieved a period of control after stopping therapy for 1 y but only three of 14 21 were able to control viremia off therapy at less than 5 000 RNA copies ml plasma for more than 2 y Duration of viremia control during successive treatment interruptions was highly variable and there was no increase in the sustainability of viral containment during successive STI cycles The three patients achieving control of viremia for more than 2 y did so during the first AC 10 the second AC 02 and the third AC 14 treatment interruption respectively Figure 2A A paired comparison Wilcoxon matched pairs signed ranks test showed no significant difference in the length of viremia control with subsequent treatment interruptions Although patients experienced rebound viremia with discontinuation of therapy none of the patients experienced recurrence of symptoms associated with acute HIV 1 infection These data show that at least transient control of viremia to less than 5 000 RNA copies ml plasma was achieved in the majority of study participants during at least one of the treatment interruptions but that durable viral control in participants following treated acute infection occurred infrequently Moreover the data do not show a consistent pattern of augmentation of viral control with sequential treatment interruptions Effect of Treatment Interruptions on CD4 T Cell Counts Although viral load is a strong predictor of disease progression CD4 T cell loss is an additional independent predictor 21 Early treatment of acute HIV 1 infection led to normalization of CD4 T cell counts in most patients median 753 cells mm 3 range 492 986 but the effect of treatment interruption was variable even in those doing well as defined by sustained low viral loads Overall 11 of 14 patients interrupted therapy for at least 12 mo and these individuals were evaluated regarding the effect of treatment interruption on CD4 T cell loss Figure 2B and 2C The rate of change in CD4 T cell counts during the first year of the longest period off treatment ranged from 157 to 438 cells mm 3 y median 192 Of the three patients who did not meet viral load criteria for restarting therapy for more than 2 y one AC 02 had an increasing CD4 T cell count of 157 cells mm 3 y one AC 10 had a stable CD4 T cell count 9 cells mm 3 y and one AC 14 experienced a decline of 344 cells mm 3 y Comparison with data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study MACS showed that the kinetics of CD4 T cell loss was faster Mann Whitney U test p 0 02 than in untreated patients with early chronic HIV 1 infection average loss of 67 cells mm 3 y in patients with a CD4 T cell count of more than 350 cells mm 3 at baseline However CD4 T cell loss rate was in the same range as what has been described after treatment interruption in chronic HIV 1 infection 22 23 Analysis of CD4 T cell decline during the second year for the three individuals who controlled viremia for more than 2 y revealed similar trends in CD4 T cell slopes although they were less steep AC 02 88 cells mm 3 y AC 10 44 cells mm 3 y and AC 14 110 cells mm 3 y When the first 3 mo off therapy were excluded in order to minimize the potential effects of recent treatment on CD4 T cell number the rate of change in CD4 T cell counts during the first year off therapy no longer differed statistically from the MACS data median 207 cell mm 3 y range 119 to 699 Mann Whitney U test p 0 07 A possible reason for steep CD4 T cell slopes may be high CD4 T cell counts at time of treatment interruption Comparison with MACS data Figure 2C showed that several of the study participants still behaved as outliers when this factor was considered These results indicate that periods of relative control of viremia were associated with declining CD4 T cell counts in most patients Correlation of Clinical and Genetic Markers with Duration of Viremia Control Although the study was small we evaluated clinical and laboratory parameters to see if any was predictive of duration of viral control Analyses included clinical and laboratory parameters at time of presentation with acute HIV 1 infection genetic markers associated with different rates of disease progression and the presence or absence of GBV C coinfection All patients presented with symptomatic acute infection Time between onset of symptoms and institution of therapy did not affect duration of control following STI Cox proportional hazards regression model p 0 05 The individuals who controlled viremia for a longer time either during the first STI or during any of the treatment interruptions were not different from those who experienced earlier breakthrough as measured by ELISA and Western blot status at initiation of HAART coreceptor polymorphisms CCR5delta32 CCR2 V64I or the presence or absence of GBV C coinfection Cox proportional hazards model p 0 05 in all comparisons data not shown The only parameter that was predictive of prolonged viral control during the first treatment interruption was a low viremia at time of institution of therapy p 0 01 there was a 2 8 fold increase in hazard per order of magnitude increase in viral load This factor was no longer predictive when the period of longest control of viremia was considered The time to rebound of viremia 50 copies ml or 400 copies ml did not correlate with the duration of viral control Although 11 out of 14 individuals achieved at least transient control of viremia and three experienced prolonged control none of these patients possessed the HLA alleles B27 or B57 associated with better disease outcome 24 25 Relationship of Magnitude and Breadth of HIV 1 Specific CD8 T Cells to Duration of Viremia Control To assess the relationship between the clinical outcome and evolution of HIV 1 specific CD8 T cells we longitudinally analyzed the breadth and magnitude of CD8 T cell responses using an interferon ELISPOT and a panel of 410 overlapping peptides spanning the entire HIV 1 clade B consensus sequence At the beginning of the first STI HIV 1 specific CD8 T cells were weak median of 590 SFCs 10 6 PBMCs Figure 3A and narrowly directed at a median of two epitopes Figure 3B CD8 T cell responses increased significantly p 0 05 during the first off treatment period reaching a median total magnitude of 2 725 SFCs 10 6 PBMCs and targeting a median of eight epitopes and then were sustained when therapy was reintroduced A further increase in the magnitude and breadth of HIV 1 specific CD8 T cells was observed in the subsequent off treatment periods although these augmentations failed to reach statistical significance The CD8 T cell mediated immune responses emerging during these consecutive cycles of treatment interruption were broadly directed targeting all structural and most accessory and regulatory HIV 1 gene products data not shown However the magnitude of HIV 1 specific CD8 T cell responses at the beginning of the first r 0 01 p 0 76 second r 0 16 p 0 54 or third r 0 1 p 0 55 treatment interruptions was not predictive of the time the study participants were subsequently able to stay off therapy according to study criteria The periods off treatment allowed for assessment of the relationship between exposure to virus and evolution of immune responses There was a highly significant positive association between time until virologic failure during the first treatment interruption and change in the magnitude of HIV 1 specific CD8 T cell responses r 0 92 p 0 001 Figure 3C Similarly the longer a patient remained off therapy during the second and third interruptions the greater the augmentation of the total magnitude of HIV 1 specific CD8 T cell responses r 0 83 p 0 016 r 0 74 p 0 05 respectively The increase in CD8 T cell epitopes targeted during the first treatment interruption was also linearly correlated to the duration until virological failure r 0 81 p 0 001 Figure 3D However no significant relationship was observed between the augmentation of epitopes targeted during the second and third treatment pauses and the time the study participants were able to remain off therapy in the respective treatment interruption These data suggest that the duration of a treatment interruption and therefore the duration of exposure to plasma virus correlates positively with the magnitude and breadth of HIV 1 specific CD8 T cell responses that emerge during off therapy time periods Yet CD8 T cell responses prior to treatment interruptions were not significantly predictive of the duration of time that patients are able to spontaneously control HIV 1 replication as defined by the study criteria Relationship of Magnitude of Lymphocyte Proliferative Responses to p24 Antigen to Duration of Viremia Control We next analyzed evolution of lymphoproliferative responses to recombinant HIV 1 p24 Gag protein in order to assess HIV 1 specific CD4 T cell function Most individuals had no detectable response at baseline prior to treatment consistent with prior reports of patients with acute HIV 1 infection 20 After initiation of therapy all individuals generated HIV 1 specific lymphoproliferative responses Figure 3E which was a criterion for inclusion in the study During treatment interruptions there was a variable decline in magnitude and comparisons between responses on the first day of treatment interruption and last day off therapy did not reach statistical significance first STI p 0 72 second p 0 12 and third p 0 60 respectively These HIV 1 specific CD4 T cell responses also tended to rise with reinitiation of therapy and some of them were very robust with stimulation indices over 50 detected in several individuals Figure 3E Similar to CD8 T cell responses the magnitude of HIV 1 specific CD4 T helper cell responses at the beginning of the first r 0 05 p 0 43 Figure 3F second r 0 16 p 0 54 or third r 0 1 p 0 55 treatment interruption was not statistically predictive of the time the study participants were subsequently able to stay off therapy according to study criteria Discussion Although early treatment of acute HIV 1 infection followed by treatment interruptions may enhance control of viremia 6 8 the durability of this control remains unclear Here we analyzed the long term impact of initiation of antiviral therapy during acute HIV 1 infection followed by STIs in a cohort of 14 patients Although initial control of viremia to less than 5 000 RNA copies ml plasma was achieved in the majority of the individuals studied a gradual increase in viremia and decline in CD4 T cell counts was observed in most patients even after a year or more of viral containment Durable virologic control occurred infrequently despite the presence of robust HIV 1 specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses detected by standard assays Moreover even during periods of successful control of viremia progressive loss of CD4 T cells was frequently observed These data indicate that although early treatment of acute and early infection is frequently associated with transient control of viremia after STI ongoing low level viral replication is associated with ultimate virologic breakthrough in most patients The standard immunologic assays and virologic assessments in this cohort revealed considerable heterogeneity among the study participants and did not show a consistent pattern in duration of viremia control during successive treatment interruptions Eleven of 14 patients 79 were able to maintain a viral load of less than 5 000 copies ml for at least 90 d but progressive loss of control ensued in the majority of patients and only three patients 21 were able to maintain control for more than 2 y These three patients did so during the first AC 10 the second AC 02 and the third AC 14 STI Clinical genetic and immunological parameters did not distinguish these three individuals from the other 11 patients nor did they predict the duration of control following treatment interruption Indeed the longer a patient was off therapy the stronger and more broadly directed the CD8 T cell responses became but these were still not sufficient to maintain prolonged control in most patients Although three patients did not complete the study as initially intended patient AC 45 withdrew from the study after viral breakthrough on the first STI AC 13 restarted therapy despite a viral load of less than 5 000 copies ml during both the first and second STIs and then withdrew and AC 05 restarted therapy prematurely during the second STI but then failed to control during the third STI the results are not substantially different if these three are censored rather than considered to have failed to control Loss of viral control in this cohort occurred not only in the presence of strong CD8 T cell responses but in most cases also in the presence of virus specific CD4 T cell responses although the CD4 T cell responses often declined during periods of viremia In addition total CD4 T cell numbers were also monitored and declined in most patients over time including one of the three patients who were able to maintain low viral loads for at least 2 y Mechanisms leading to rapid CD4 T cell loss need to be further studied in future STI trials Other parameters including chemokine receptor polymorphisms 26 and GBV C coinfection 27 28 similarly failed to explain the different courses following treatment interruption The only parameter found to be associated with longer control of viremia during the first treatment interruption was a lower viral load at time of institution of antiviral therapy Given the multiplicity of comparisons made the true significance of this finding is uncertain The reasons for progressive loss of control despite augmentation of virus specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses remain to be defined In one individual AC 06 HIV 1 superinfection in the setting of strong and broadly directed HIV specific cellular immune responses was associated with the loss of viral control as previously reported 29 No other cases of superinfection have been identified in these patients data not shown The immunologic studies performed failed to show an association between increases in viral load and loss of immune responses but this may be due to the use of the current standard IFN assays to quantify immune function Numerous studies now indicate that IFN production alone is not associated with viral load 19 30 31 but rather that functional characteristics of CD4 and CD8 T cells may be better associated with viral control 32 33 34 35 Such studies will be important to pursue In particular even a low level of viremia correlates with a low or undetectable frequency of interleukin 2 producing HIV 1 specific memory CD4 T cells endowed with proliferative capacity in vitro 36 37 38 39 thus abrogating CD4 T cell help crucial to maintain efficacy of CD8 T cell functions In an interim study of a subset of six of the 14 patients presented here patients AC 02 AC 05 AC 14 AC 15 AC 25 and AC 46 a fully differentiated effector phenotype of HIV 1 specific CD8 T cells for selected epitopes was found to be associated with better control of viremia 10 Other factors that may contribute include functional defects in antigen specific cell mediated immunity 35 37 40 41 42 and progressive immune escape 43 44 45 HIV 1 specific humoral immunity can also affect viral control after treatment interruption 46 and viral factors including viral fitness 47 48 and infection with multiple viral variants 49 can influence viral set point and the rate of disease progression Virus sequencing studies currently in progress in this cohort indicate that viral breakthrough is associated with sequence changes within and outside known CTL epitopes data not shown Full evaluation of the relationship between immune escape and viral breakthrough will require extensive additional analyses including detailed analysis of responses to autologous virus 50 51 Assessing the changes in CD4 and CD8 T cell functions over time as well as viral evolution under immune selection pressure will be important to evaluate immune correlates in this cohort These data are important in light of other recent data on treatment interruption in both acute and chronic infection In chronic HIV 1 infection STI studies showed only marginal if any improvements of HIV 1 viremia control following a number of treatment interruptions cycles despite at least transient increases in HIV 1 specific CD8 and CD4 T cell responses 4 5 52 53 54 55 In the setting of infection with a multidrug resistant virus this strategy may even be deleterious 56 Other studies of STI after treated acute HIV 1 infection have shown limited benefits 9 including recent trials such as the PrimSTOP trial 57 and the QUEST study 58 However little is known about the relationship between scheduling of HAART and treatment interruptions and the characteristics of viral rebound after therapy has been discontinued Although durable control of viremia was not achieved it is noteworthy that the majority of patients were able to achieve transient relative containment of viremia providing rationale for future studies aimed at further enhancing immune control Early treatment alone should still be considered an important therapeutic option Therapeutic vaccinations administered after treated acute HIV 1 infection and before cessation of therapy have given disappointing results thus far 9 but the availability of new and more potent immunogens requires reassessment of this approach Indeed the ability to enhance CD4 T helper cell responses in the chronic phase of infection has been demonstrated 59 but whether this will enhance CD8 T cell function requires additional studies Some promising results have been obtained using immunomodulatory drugs including cyclosporine 60 and hydroxyurea 61 in combination with antiviral therapy presumably because of the limitation of T cell activation Administration of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor blunted the viral rebound following interruption of HAART and largely prevented a decrease of CD4 T cell counts in an STI trial in chronic HIV 1 infection 62 These additional therapeutic interventions deserve further investigation in future STI studies Although the present study shows progressive viral breakthrough it was not designed to address whether there might be a change in set point viremia achieved or overall clinical benefit through transient early treatment of acute HIV infection The definition of failure chosen for this study was a viral load of greater than 5 000 RNA copies ml plasma which at the time the study was initiated corresponded to the level of viremia at which treatment was recommended Larger randomized trials will be needed to determine the potential clinical and virologic benefit of approaches based on STIs In studies of untreated infection there is only a 5 fold difference in viremia separating the quartile with the slowest disease progression from the quartile with the most rapid progression 63 suggesting that small differences in steady state viremia may influence clinical outcome In the meantime STI probably should be avoided outside the setting of controlled clinical trials The data in this study may also be relevant to current efforts to develop a therapeutic AIDS vaccine designed to retard disease progression rather than prevent infection since they suggest that durable maintenance of low level viremia may be difficult to achieve Supporting Information
