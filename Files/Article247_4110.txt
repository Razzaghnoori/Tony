 Twitchy Bush Extraterrestrial Forbes Evan I was happy to see you refer to a restaurant where people smoke freely at their tables as unsullied just as I was discouraged but not surprised to learn that cowboys in Marfa Texas are dreaming about easy IPO riches At least they re smoking as they do it Someday even cowboys will be smoke free and doing Tae Bo and America will have lost something Pardon me but I m in a nostalgic mood Must be the effect of watching last night s debate Bush did a decent job I thought but he just didn t come across the way he did six months ago He seemed far stiffer and more programmed than I remember His physical restlessness which always stuck me as appealingly energetic and vital all of a sudden seemed twitchy and nervous Part of it is context Bush is so much better in person than he is behind a microphone that people who ve experienced him only through television must be baffled by his endorsements and fund raising success But it s more than that I think he s changed This spring for instance I asked Bush about his reading habits He was pretty straightforward about preferring page long briefing memos from his staff and sports on TV He didn t pull a Dan Quayle and brag about reading Plato in the original Latin But last night when Brit Hume asked him what he was reading Bush boldly claimed to be immersed in a book on Dean Acheson There s nothing wrong with not reading books about Dean Acheson There is something awful about pretending you do Hume s a pretty nice guy so he didn t hit Bush with the obvious and tempting follow up questions A book about Dean Acheson huh Quick What s the title of the book Who wrote it How many terms did Acheson serve as vice president That s a trick question Gov Gotcha But the Acheson phoniness wasn t Bush s real problem last night He did himself the greatest damage when he agreed to appear with the other five candidates in the first place Yes I know he had no choice that the political costs of ditching another debate were too high Still it s hard to maintain a front runner s dignity and mystique if you re sharing a stage with Alan Keyes Not to beat up on Keyes I like him He seems sincere He s a totally compelling orator one of the few people I ve ever heard who speaks extemporaneously in flawless perfectly delineated ready to print paragraphs And I agree with him on more things than you probably care to know about In fact Keyes doesn t really fall apart until you administer what I think of as the Despot Test It s simple If a candidate had absolute power how many people would he kill Keyes doesn t do well on this part of the exam At all There s something about his eyes Speaking of I had a pretty disturbing X Files moment toward the end of the debate when I looked too long at Steve Forbes Mesmerized by his unblinking stare I suddenly had the feeling he was going to steal my soul I choked back panic and turned away probably just in time Spooky I think Bush has had the same experience which may explain why he was comparatively tough on Forbes who poses no real threat to him while he went out of his way to stroke McCain literally at one point on the cheek who has a shot at beating him in New Hampshire With Bush one gets the sense that a lot of politics is personal Doesn t bother me At least he knows an alien when he sees one Best Tucker
