 Introduction Hypokalemia and many types of electrocardiographic ECG abnormality are observed during the acute phase of subarachnoid hemorrhage SAH 1 2 3 Among ECG abnormalities a prolongation of the QT interval especially when associated with hypokalemia deserves particular attention because it is frequently observed in those patients who develop life threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as tor sades de pointes 1 2 4 However the pathogeneses of these abnormalities during the acute phase of SAH have not yet been fully investigated It is commonly believed that hypokalemia identified during the acute phase of SAH is caused by a catecholamine surge following SAH 2 In healthy male volunteers Brown and coworkers 5 demonstrated that serum infused adrenaline epinephrine caused excessive activation of the sodium potassium ATPase Na K ATPase Na K pump as a result of 2 adrenergic receptor stimulation this resulted in trafficking of potassium ions from extracellular to intracellu lar spaces leading to a decrease in serum potassium levels Recent work showed that there were some relationships between serum catecholamine levels and QT intervals during the acute phase of SAH 1 6 However one cannot refute the possibility that the catecholamine surge may influence the QT interval indirectly via hypokalemia because hypokalemia as well as hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia can cause a prolongation in the QT interval 4 7 8 9 In a previous preliminary study 3 we suggested that women may be more prone than men to develop both hypokalemia and prolongation in the corrected QT QTc interval on the first day of SAH In the present prospective study we assessed various possible risk factors for the QTc prolongation that is observed in SAH patients in order to examine independent risk factors by means of multivariate analysis Patients and method Patients We prospectively studied 100 patients admitted within 24 hours after onset of SAH to the National Defense Medical College Hospital between January 1997 and April 2002 Of these 100 patients 36 were men and 64 were women mean age on admission was 59 1 11 8 years with a range of 21 82 years Neurologic condition on admission was evaluated according to the Hunt and Kosnik classification 10 and severity of SAH was assessed according to Fisher s classification 11 The exclusion criteria included endocrino logic disease heart disease renal failure previous SAH or intracerebral hemorrhage young age 19 years pregnancy pacemaker rhythm or taking any of the following drugs digitalis quinidine procainamide disopyramide and diuretics All patients had brain computed tomography studies compatible with their diagnoses Each patient underwent a cerebral angiogram to identify a ruptured aneurysm except for eight patients whose SAH were so severe that there was no indication for cerebral angiography Patients with traumatic SAH or SAH of unknown origin despite assessment by cerebral angiography were also excluded from the study Informed consent was obtained from the patients and or their guardians Data collection Standard 12 lead ECG was performed immediately after admission Two consecutive QT intervals were manually measured for all 12 leads of the ECG with the assessor blinded to the name and group of the patient The QT intervals were measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the visual return of the T wave to the isoelectric line and were corrected for heart rate using the Bazett formula QTc QT square root of RR interval The mean QTc interval was calculated from all QTc intervals measured The intraob server coefficient of variation was 1 5 and the interobserver coefficient of variation was 1 8 Blood samples were obtained from the patients at the same time as ECG and serum levels of sodium potassium calcium adrenaline noradrenaline norepinephrine dopamine antidiuretic hormone and glucose were measured Statistical analyses In order to identify potential risk factors for severe QTc prolongation univariate analysis was conducted using the 2test Student s t test or Mann Whitney U test The model was reduced using manual back and forth procedure with variable selection based on the statistical significance of the estimates P 0 1 Multiple logistic regression analysis was then performed to identify independent risk factors for severe QTc prolongation Pearson s correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation between serum potassium levels and QTc intervals Data are expressed as means SD P 0 05 was considered statistically significant and all analyses were performed using the StatView Version 5 0 statistical package SAS Institute Inc Cary NC USA Results Univariate analysis Univariate analyses demonstrated that there were significant relationships between the category of QTc interval and patient sex Table 1 Significant relationships were also identified between category of QTc interval and the serum concentrations of potassium calcium or glucose Table 1 Severe QTc prolongation 470 ms or more n 40 was more frequent among female SAH patients 53 1 P 0 0004 than among male patients 16 7 The patients with severe QTc prolongation had lower serum potassium levels 3 21 0 43 mmol l P 0 0001 than did patients with a QTc interval of less than 470 ms 3 63 0 42 mmol l Hypokalemia was defined as serum potassium level below 3 5 mmol l Severe QTc prolongation was more frequently found among SAH patients with hypokalemia 58 8 P 0 0001 than among SAH patients with normokalemia 20 4 Patients with severe QTc prolongation also had lower serum calcium levels 8 29 0 52 mmol l P 0 1 as compared with patients with a QTc interval of less than 470 ms 8 52 0 39 mmol l The concentration of serum glucose was significantly higher in patients with a severely prolonged QTc interval 207 56 mg dl P 0 02 as compared with patients with a QTc interval of less than 470 ms 178 49 mg dl There was however no relation between category of QTc interval and patient age Hunt and Kosnik grade Fisher s classification for computed tomography site of ruptured aneurysm or the serum concentration of sodium adrenaline noradrenaline dopamine or antidiuretic hormone There were significant inverse correlations between serum potassium level and serum concentrations of adrenaline noradrenaline dopamine and antidiuretic hormone r 0 712 0 573 0 432 0 442 respectively Furthermore female SAH patients had lower potassium levels 3 36 0 50 mmol l P 0 001 than did male SAH patients 3 65 0 36 mmol l Multivariate analysis The multivariate analyses showed that female sex and hypokalemia were independent risk factors for severe QTc prolongation in patients with SAH In the first analysis the serum potassium level was considered a continuous variable analysis 1 Table 2 An increase of 1 mmol l in serum potassium was associated with a relative risk of 0 13 95 confidence interval 0 04 0 43 P 0 001 for severe QTc prolongation while female sex was associated with a relative risk of 3 69 95 confidence interval 1 27 10 73 P 0 02 as compared with male sex A second analysis analysis 2 Table 2 revealed that hypokalemia was associated with a relative risk of 4 53 95 confidence interval 1 79 11 50 P 0 002 as compared with normokalemia while the relative risk with female sex was 4 45 95 confidence interval 1 55 12 78 P 0 01 as compared with male sex Correlation between serum potassium level and corrected QT interval There was a significant inverse correlation between serum potassium level and QTc interval Pearson s correlation coefficient r 0 439 P 0 0001 Fig 1a among all SAH patients Furthermore we evaluated the impact of sex on the correlation between serum potassium levels and QTc interval Among female SAH patients there was a significant inverse correlation between serum potassium levels and QTc interval r 0 474 P 0 0001 Fig 1c On the other hand there was no significant correlation between the serum potassium levels and QTc intervals r 0 009 Fig 1b among male SAH patients Discussion The present findings suggest that female sex and hypokalemia are independent risk factors for severe QTc prolongation in patients with SAH Recent clinical observations and experimental data indicate sex specific differences in various ECG abnormalities Several in vitro and in vivo experimental studies 12 13 14 have shown that female sex is a strong risk factor for drug induced long QT interval and cardiac arrhythmias In a study of healthy young individuals Stramba Badiale and coworkers 15 demonstrated that females had a longer QTc interval than did males Furthermore recent evidence suggested that women are more prone than men to develop torsades de pointes during administration of cardiovascular drugs that prolong cardiac repolarization 9 16 However little is known about the mechanism responsible for these sex related differences in the QTc interval or in the occurrence of torsades de pointes Several studies have indicated that sex hormones play an important role in these sex differences Drici and coworkers 17 showed that ovariectomy resulted in a shorter QT interval and high doses of sex hormones lengthened the QT interval In addition Haseroth and coworkers 18 demonstrated that estrogen replacement therapy significantly prolonged QTc intervals in post menopausal women However several other studies reported that sex hormones did not affect the QT interval in healthy women 19 20 Various factors may be involved in the sex specific difference in ventricular repolarization e g sex related differences in cardiac ionic channels Female rabbit ventricular myocytes had a significantly slower rapid component of the delayed rectifier than did male cells which might contribute to the gender difference in the QT interval 12 In fact most drugs that prolong the QTc interval have been shown to block cardiac potassium channels especially the rapid component of the delayed rectifier 21 22 Women are more susceptible to hypokalemia especially that due to diuretics 23 24 or SAH 3 Considering that hypokalemia causes a prolongation in the QTc interval 4 7 8 9 25 the sex specific difference in ventricular repolarization described above might result from the sex related difference in serum potassium levels It is interesting that serum potassium levels did not affect QTc interval among male SAH patients whereas there was a significant inverse correlation between serum potassium levels and QTc interval among female patients in the present study One mechanism that may account for this sex specific difference in serum potassium levels is a sex specific difference in the activity of the Na K ATPase Na K pump as reported by Lasker and coworkers 26 Those investigators found that Na K ATPase activity in red blood cells was higher in females than in males thus leading to a sex specific difference in the Na K balance in both the intracellular and extracellular spaces Another possible explanation is a difference in the total exchangeable body potassium Kleinfeld and coworkers 27 demonstrated that elderly women were more vulnerable to hypokalemia and indicated that this was possibly due to age and sex associated differences in body mass composition which might result in a physiologically low total exchangeable body potassium An inverse correlation between the serum catecholamines and potassium levels suggests that a catecholamine surge following SAH plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hypokalemia during the acute phase of SAH Recent evidence suggested that adrenaline induced hypokalemia resulted from stimulation of a adrenoceptor linked to membrane Na K ATPase causing potassium influx 5 28 On the other hand there was no correlation between serum cate cholamine level and QTc interval in the present series These findings indicate that a catecholamine surge following SAH does not play a direct role in the pathogenesis of the QTc prolongation in patients with SAH Interestingly Reid and coworkers 28 showed that serum infused adrenaline caused not only hypokalemia but also a prolongation in the QTc interval in normal volunteers which appears to be highly consistent with the present findings in patients with SAH The therapeutic implications of the present findings are clear When a patient with SAH is hospitalized during the acute phase of SAH as a rule potassium free intravenous fluids should not be used as initial fluid therapy particularly in female patients Furthermore careful ECG monitoring is needed to detect critical cardiac arrhythmias as soon as possible and avoidance of drugs that prolong ventricular repolarization quinidine procainamide and disopyramide in patients with SAH especially female patients is mandatory The findings reported here also suggest an important new direction for further research focusing on the detection of critical cardiac arrhythmias in order to prevent sudden death at an early stage in SAH There are some limits to the conclusions that can be drawn from the present study The study lacks data on ECG changes after admission in the SAH patients which can only be assessed by means of continuous Holter monitoring It was therefore impossible to consider the influence of QTc prolongation on the occurrence of critical cardiac arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes Further studies are required to investigate the pathophysiologic basis for the QTc prolongation and to assess ECG changes after admission in patients with SAH Competing interests None declared Key messages A prolongation in QTc interval is often observed during the acute phase of SAH Female sex and hypokalemia are independent risk factors for severe QTc prolongation in patients with SAH The clinical implication of this is that when a patient with SAH is hospitalized during the acute phase of SAH as a rule potassium free intravenous fluids should not be used for initial fluid therapy particularly in female patients In patients with SAH careful ECG monitoring is needed to detect critical cardiac arrhythmias as soon as possible and avoidance of drugs that prolong ventricular repolarization quinidine procainamide and disopyramide is mandatory especially in female SAH patients Abbreviations ECG electrocardiogram electrocardiography Na K ATPase sodium potassium ATPase QTc corrected QT SAH
