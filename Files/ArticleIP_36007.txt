 P Is the quot Sensation quot Art Worth the Fuss P Dear David Thanks for your speedy response I found your comments more interesting than your earlier ones mainly because you acknowledged liking some of the artists in the show And that s good I m glad I was beginning to wonder whether you were a knee jerk neo conservative which is even worse than being a knee jerk liberal Knee jerk liberals are at least motivated by a desire for social justice while knee jerk neo conservatives operate strictly out of fear a fear of change a fear of human instinct a fear it often seems to me of their own latent homosexuality Getting back to Chris Ofili No I do not think that his inclusion of porn cutouts in the painting brands him as a rude provocateur Remember the Virgin Mary may be a timeless symbol but she is also a flesh and blood woman and Ofili is hardly the first artist to eroticize the Virgin It s been going on at least since the Renaissance I m sure you re familiar with Leo Steinberg s book on the subject Moreover since you re a guy I shouldn t have to tell you that virgins are sexy Why do you speak of Sarah Lucas as nasty I think she s major I loved Au Naturel that bare mattress piece with the melon breasts and erect cucumber It manages to be both cultivated and raw at the same time which is basically what I look for in any work of art The piece evokes Rauschenberg s famous painted Bed and might be seen as Rauschenberg s bed unmade If we get away from the art stars Hirst Ofili etc for a moment I d like to say that for me there were many small discoveries in the show For instance I had never before seen Mat Collishaw s Bullet Hole and I found it totally engaging As you know it s a big lighted close up of a head wound that bears an unsettling resemblance to an anus and when I saw it I thought to myself That s the story of my life Half head half asshole Or to be more elegant here in keeping with the spirit of your own mandarin replies you might say that the piece subverts the tradition of staged photography blasting a hole through the cold calculating heart of 90s art I agree with you that Simon Patterson is not the next Picasso but so what The Armory Show of 1913 probably the last show in New York to cause this level of commotion had its share of duds as well Let s concentrate on the artists we like There are lots of first rate artists in Sensation and I can t think of any other recent show that captures so forcefully the particular feeling of being alive in the 90s which sometimes means feeling like you re dead I loved Ron Mueck s Dead Dad Yours truly Deborah
