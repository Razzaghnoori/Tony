              um i find that my main source of information on current events is conversations with other people i often find myself going oh is that right i didnt realize that it happened yesterday   oh really so you do you uh dont pay attention to uh primary sources   no not not on a regular basis   like TV or oh thats interesting   yeah i uh have frequently decided just that i would just go ahead and read a paper every day but i havent really done it as often as i i intended   what about television   um i just dont watch much television im usually i usually dont get home until after the evening news is over and im usually in bed by the time the late news starts   umhum   but i um i do watch some TV and and sometimes therell be if its some big news with like with the primaries and things like that they would run little banners across the bottom of the TV screen   what about the gulf war   um i i worked with a guy who was in the who had just gotten out of the army and he told me he kept me up to date on what was going on   um   how do you keep up on current events     oh well im pretty much of a space cadet a zombie i really dont know much whats going on uh i guess most mostly of what i get is from the news from the excuse me from the newspaper i dont have a television so that doesnt help           do you feel like you keep up sufficiently i mean are you as caught up with it as youd like to be   um i get a daily newspaper and um i think newspapers are better then television for in depth news they uh the television uh actually is good in uh uh particularly when were youre talking about personalities because you can get a heck of a lot more through uh complete audio visual presentation like for example in the political debates and what not   right   than you do through distilled string of words uh in the newspaper but actually for indepth information the newspaper newspaper is definitely better uh because the television just presents highlights and doesnt really go much indepth       cant really because they dont have the time   right right i guess id have to agree with you i hadnt really though of that but i certainly       seems seems   and when im on airplanes i will use i will read news news magazines uh that my son likes news magazines but uh i i guess i just never get around to reading them   right   its sort of a tradition to read the newspaper over breakfast but     is that what you do   yeah   read your newspaper over breakfast and   yeah sort of of   sort of a relaxing time   well yeah um do you listen to the radio much   nope nope i think radio is in our house more of a source for music in quotes   yeah   i dont i dont listen to the radio but my son does of course hes thirteen and his idea of music is not quite the same as my idea of music     um yeah i get i get a little bit of news from the radio just theyll have hourly updates on some news caps   oh yeah well when im driving in the car thats right sometimes uh well driving in the bay area is risky in the since that you may run into uh traffic problems   uhhuh   so i will tune in to news uh station where they give every ten minutes they give traffic information and uh as a sort of a side effect i get news that way   right um i would think even the traffic i think of the traffic updates as news also just because there i guess they qualify as a current event   well i guess youre right  nothing more current than uh uh nothing more current and nothing more news worthy than uh traffic problems if at least not if youre a driver     right     so uh i didnt even think about that   i guess um       i would think that would be probably on a i guess as a percentage of the population that would keep up with something i bet the traffic conditions is probably number one   umhum well its a beautiful day here in uh California im standing outside of a phone booth you know when you call in youre supposed i guess youre supposed to call from different numbers so   oh   i call from a bunch of uh pay phone pay phones and whatnot so the news the news the current event news in California is that we had rain yesterday and uh its sort of a cloudy i would say broken skies mostly almost not quite overcast but almost overcast and uh thats your current current event news cast from um
