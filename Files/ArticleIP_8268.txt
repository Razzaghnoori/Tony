 Here s Your Hat What s Your Worry Hats arouse fully as much feeling as hairstyles or they would if enough of them were being worn For 30 years we have been living in the Bareheaded Age worrying intensely about our hair Many of us don t even remember the time when people would no more go outdoors without a hat than they would without shoes The exact character of your hat mattered a lot then much as the look of your hair does now Your hat confirmed your outfit putting the final seal on whatever else you wore crowning your image and arming your ego for social and professional life or just for itself During the summer in the country my grandfather would put on his hat to go down to the end of the driveway and get the letters out of the mailbox I would laugh at him free of the requirement myself but in his youth even kids wore hats whenever they went outdoors Hair rose up and drove out hats in the 1960s rose up spread out and flowed down in merciless torrents sweeping away conventional hats as if they represented all that was loathsome in civilized life A few cute hats most of them faintly satirical costumey and historical were worn by a few cute people for momentary

with Clifton Webb Along with much else women s hats are no longer a normal part of the mating game Women s hats are out there but they re all optional and the range has shrunk They come in very few basic shapes like dresses and nobody gets any basic training in hat choice or hat management since real allure is felt to reside in hair not in hats Real absurdity too of course But winter is coming The Hair Revolution was no help in bitter weather and for a while everybody but Floridians and Californians simply froze above the neck Lately healthy utilitarian hats have returned in force along with athletic footgear and down jackets and there s even a certain limited stylishness in recent examples Fur is back too as are delicious pile fabrics so that luxury can be combined with utility Meanwhile thousands of watch caps ear flap caps and wool berets are available from street vendors to provide instant warmth for passers by without much regard for expressive charm In this day of virtual uniformity it s curious that whenever a woman wears any hat at all somebody is bound to say I love your hat as if out of subliminal nostalgia for the truly great days Nobody says this to men

hair to curl up my cheeks and down my forehead Russian heroine style More risky since I m not tall is my cavalier hat in silvery streaked brown and black velvet with a biggish mobile brim for folding up and down at will fore and aft or amidships Short small women have to remember that they can quickly resemble a mushroom in anything too big or a child in anything too cute Medium sized or large and
