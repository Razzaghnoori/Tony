 Background Chronic hepatitis C virus HCV infection is a slowly progressive disease that affects approximately 2 7 million persons in the United States 1 Most persons with hepatitis C are asymptomatic although some experience fatigue or other nonspecific symptoms 2 3 The minority progress to cirrhosis liver cancer or liver failure 4 5 6 Both physicians and patients must weigh the immediate harm associated with treatment for HCV including side effects and cost of therapy against potential future benefits when making treatment decisions Interferon and ribavirin cause a number of adverse effects including fatigue flu like symptoms insomnia depression cough and cytopenia 7 8 9 The cost of therapy is approximately 1 000 per month with additional charges for laboratory testing and physician s visits On the other hand a sustained response to therapy is associated with persistently undetectable HCV RNA improved liver histology and gains in health related quality of life 10 11 12 Limited information is available about physicians perceptions of quality of life with hepatitis C Physicians perspectives on HCV and its treatment may influence the advice that they give to their patients about the disease In the current study we used utility analysis to evaluate physicians perspectives about hepatitis C and its therapy Utility analysis provides a means to quantify preference values about disease states 13 14 The aims of the study were 1 to assess whether physicians could provide utilities for hepatitis C health state constructs using visual analog scales 2 to quantify physicians judgments about various hepatitis C health states and 3 to assess physicians thresholds for recommending treatment Methods Subjects and study instrument Participants consisted of a convenience sample of 113 physicians from Illinois Iowa South Carolina Indiana and Michigan Physicians were surveyed when they attended continuing medical education lectures in Gastroenterology given in 1999 The questionnaire was administered using a paper and pencil format and was completed before the lecture Demographic information included gender race education and specialty Participants were asked if they treated patients with Hepatitis C Five hepatitis C health states HS were described ranging from HS1 No Symptoms No Cirrhosis to HS5 Severe Symptoms Cirrhosis Table 1 The descriptions of the hepatitis C health states were developed based on the findings of our previous study of symptoms in patients with HCV 3 and on a consensus of a group of hepatologists experienced in managing patients with hepatitis C The description of the side effects of treatment was based on published accounts of the adverse effects of interferon and ribavirin 7 8 9 15 Physicians rated hepatitis C health states using a visual analog scale where 0 represented death and 100 corresponded to life without hepatitis C We designated life without hepatitis C as the highest preference value and assessed preferences for the health state hepatitis C with No Symptoms No cirrhosis because the psychological impact of having a disease can effect health status in the absence of physical symptoms Physicians also rated side effects of antiviral therapy for hepatitis C on a visual analog scale Finally participating physicians provided their threshold for recommending antiviral therapy That is the sustained virologic response rate that they would require before they would recommend treatment to their patients Statistical analysis Preference values for hepatitis C health states were compared using the Kruskal Wallis test The Mann Whitney U test was used to evaluate the relationship between categorical demographic variables and physicians preference values The relationship between continuous demographic variables and preference values was assessed by the Spearman test This test also was used to evaluate for an association between preference values for hepatitis C health states ratings of side effects of antiviral therapy and treatment threshold Results Demographic data for the participating physicians are presented in Table 2 The majority was primary care physicians 81 including Internists and Family Practitioners Physicians preference values for the hepatitis C health states are shown in Figure 1 Utility values decreased as health state severity increased p 0 001 The median preference value for HS1 No Symptoms No Cirrhosis was 88 interquartile range 75 95 corresponding to a 12 reduction from life without hepatitis C In contrast the median preference value for HS5 Severe Symptoms Cirrhosis was only 18 interquartile range 8 30 The median preference value for life with the side effects of antiviral therapy was 47 interquartile range 23 55 That is physicians felt that side effects were associated with a 53 reduction from good health After considering the HCV health states and the side effects of therapy physicians indicated that they would require a median of a 60 sustained response rate interquartile range 40 80 before recommending treatment Only 13 of participating physicians would accept the 30 response rate offered by current antiviral therapy for patients with HCV genotype 1 disease Figure 2 Health state utility values did not vary significantly with physicians age gender race specialty or whether they treated hepatitis C Ratings of side effects and thresholds for recommending treatment were similar across the demographic variables There were no significant correlations between preference values for hepatitis C health states ratings of side effects of therapy and treatment thresholds Discussion In the current study we developed and evaluated descriptions of hepatitis C health states and side effects of antiviral therapy We found that physicians understood these descriptions and were able to provide utility assessments using a visual analog scale Preference values declined significantly with increasing health state severity supporting the validity of the health state constructs Physicians felt that hepatitis C causes a dramatic reduction in health status Even the presence of hepatitis C without symptoms or cirrhosis HS 1 was judged to carry a 12 decrement from life without HCV Our findings parallel those of a study that used the time trade off method to assess physicians preference values for health states associated with hepatitis B and HIV 16 Interestingly the median preference value for hepatitis C without symptoms in our series was between that provided for HBV without symptoms 92 and HIV without symptoms 83 in the previous study 16 The large range of physicians rating of treatment side effects Figure 1 is striking and indicates that doctors views about the impact of side effects on health status vary substantially However the side effects of antiviral therapy were judged severely overall with a median preference value of 47 That is time on therapy was felt to be associated with a 53 reduction from good health The median preference value for treatment side effects was similar to that provided for HS3 Moderate Symptoms No Cirrhosis On average physicians indicated that they would require a 60 sustained response before recommending therapy to their patients The 60 threshold far exceeds the 30 sustained response rate to interferon and ribavirin therapy reported for patients with hepatitis C genotype 1 infection 7 8 In fact only 13 of physicians reported a threshold for recommending therapy of 30 or less The unfavorable assessment of treatment side effects reported by physicians in the current study provides one explanation for relatively low referral rates for hepatitis C among primary care providers A survey of primary care physicians showed that only 62 refer anti HCV positive patients with abnormal transaminase levels to sub specialists 17 The lack of a significant correlation between the respondents ratings of treatment side effects and their thresholds for recommending treatment is surprising We would expect clinicians to make decisions that are consistent with their views on the harm and benefit of a particular therapy Our data show that a group of physicians comprised largely of primary care providers would require a high degree of benefit in terms of response rate to recommend therapy for HCV which was not necessarily related to their perspectives on the harm associated with treatment side effects The absence of such a relationship may reflect limited knowledge about hepatitis C and response rates to therapy or preconceived notions about the disease and its treatment This finding is particularly important because primary care providers often decide whether to refer patients to a sub specialist They also educate patients and shape their views about new diagnoses Continuing education for physicians about the natural history and treatment of hepatitis C is of key importance in helping them to provide optimal advice to their patients Advances in antiviral therapy for hepatitis C will affect how physicians and patients view the issue of treatment Preliminary data suggest that the combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin will increase sustained response rates to more than 50 overall and to greater than 40 in patients with hepatitis C genotype 1 infection 18 Hepatologists need to understand other physicians perspectives on hepatitis C so that they can adequately address their concerns about treatment issues Further work is needed to help physicians to understand their patients views on hepatitis C A recent study showed that persons with hepatitis C preferred to expedite periods of poor health implying that they may be more likely to proceed with antiviral therapy and its attendant side effects than to delay treatment 19 In contrast the physicians in the current survey had a relatively high threshold for recommending treatment which would lead them to postpone therapy in the majority of cases Utility analysis may have a role in facilitating joint decision making between physicians and patients regarding hepatitis C This study does have limitations We studied a convenience sample of physicians attending continuing medical education lectures The findings could be biased because we did not collect data on response rates or on the demographic features of physicians who did not complete the survey Furthermore although the study population consisted largely of primary care providers some sub specialists were included However the respondents do represent a cross section of physicians who may be involved with the diagnosis of hepatitis C Conclusions We have developed and evaluated health state descriptions for hepatitis C Physicians felt that hepatitis C health states were associated with a substantial decrement in health status Physicians provided particularly low preference values for side effects of antiviral therapy and high thresholds for recommending treatment However ratings of side effects were not significantly correlated with thresholds for recommending therapy suggesting that additional factors effect physicians views about antiviral therapy The use of utility analysis could provide a basis for shared decision making between patients and their physicians about hepatitis C List of Abbreviations HS health state HCV hepatitis C virus RNA ribonucleic acid
