                    Background        Chronic hepatitis C virus HCV infection is a slowly        progressive disease that affects approximately  million        persons in the United States     Most persons with        hepatitis C are asymptomatic although some experience        fatigue or other nonspecific symptoms      The        minority progress to cirrhosis liver cancer or liver        failure       Both physicians and patients must weigh        the immediate harm associated with treatment for HCV        including side effects and cost of therapy against        potential future benefits when making treatment decisions        Interferon and ribavirin cause a number of adverse effects        including fatigue flulike symptoms insomnia depression        cough and cytopenia       The cost of therapy is        approximately  per month with additional charges for        laboratory testing and physicians visits On the other        hand a sustained response to therapy is associated with        persistently undetectable HCV RNA improved liver        histology and gains in healthrelated quality of life                     Limited information is available about physicians        perceptions of quality of life with hepatitis C        Physicians perspectives on HCV and its treatment may        influence the advice that they give to their patients about        the disease In the current study we used utility analysis        to evaluate physicians perspectives about hepatitis C and        its therapy Utility analysis provides a means to quantify        preference values about disease states      The aims        of the study were  to assess whether physicians could        provide utilities for hepatitis C health state constructs        using visual analog scales  to quantify physicians        judgments about various hepatitis C health states and         to assess physicians thresholds for recommending        treatment                    Methods                  Subjects and study instrument          Participants consisted of a convenience sample of           physicians from Illinois Iowa South Carolina Indiana          and Michigan Physicians were surveyed when they attended          continuing medical education lectures in Gastroenterology          given in  The questionnaire was administered using a          paper and pencil format and was completed before the          lecture Demographic information included gender race          education and specialty Participants were asked if they          treated patients with Hepatitis C Five hepatitis C          health states HS were described ranging from HSNo          Symptoms No Cirrhosis to HSSevere Symptoms Cirrhosis          Table  The descriptions of the hepatitis C health          states were developed based on the findings of our          previous study of symptoms in patients with HCV    and          on a consensus of a group of hepatologists experienced in          managing patients with hepatitis C The description of          the side effects of treatment was based on published          accounts of the adverse effects of interferon and          ribavirin                 Physicians rated hepatitis C health states using a          visual analog scale where  represented death and           corresponded to life without hepatitis C We designated          life without hepatitis C as the highest preference value          and assessed preferences for the health state hepatitis C          with No Symptoms No cirrhosis because the psychological          impact of having a disease can effect health status in          the absence of physical symptoms Physicians also rated          side effects of antiviral therapy for hepatitis C on a          visual analog scale Finally participating physicians          provided their threshold for recommending antiviral          therapy That is the sustained virologic response rate          that they would require before they would recommend          treatment to their patients                          Statistical analysis          Preference values for hepatitis C health states were          compared using the KruskalWallis test The MannWhitney          U test was used to evaluate the relationship between          categorical demographic variables and physicians          preference values The relationship between continuous          demographic variables and preference values was assessed          by the Spearman test This test also was used to evaluate          for an association between preference values for          hepatitis C health states ratings of side effects of          antiviral therapy and treatment threshold                            Results        Demographic data for the participating physicians are        presented in Table  The majority was primary care        physicians  including Internists and Family        Practitioners        Physicians preference values for the hepatitis C health        states are shown in Figure  Utility values decreased as        health state severity increased p   The median        preference value for HSNo Symptoms No Cirrhosis was         interquartile range  corresponding to a         reduction from life without hepatitis C In contrast the        median preference value for HSSevere Symptoms Cirrhosis        was only  interquartile range         The median preference value for life with the side        effects of antiviral therapy was  interquartile range         That is physicians felt that side effects were        associated with a  reduction from good health After        considering the HCV health states and the side effects of        therapy physicians indicated that they would require a        median of a  sustained response rate interquartile        range  before recommending treatment Only  of        participating physicians would accept the  response rate        offered by current antiviral therapy for patients with HCV        genotype  disease Figure         Health state utility values did not vary significantly        with physicians age gender race specialty or whether        they treated hepatitis C Ratings of side effects and        thresholds for recommending treatment were similar across        the demographic variables There were no significant        correlations between preference values for hepatitis C        health states ratings of side effects of therapy and        treatment thresholds                    Discussion        In the current study we developed and evaluated        descriptions of hepatitis C health states and side effects        of antiviral therapy We found that physicians understood        these descriptions and were able to provide utility        assessments using a visual analog scale Preference values        declined significantly with increasing health state        severity supporting the validity of the health state        constructs        Physicians felt that hepatitis C causes a dramatic        reduction in health status Even the presence of hepatitis        C without symptoms or cirrhosis HS  was judged to        carry a  decrement from life without HCV Our findings        parallel those of a study that used the timetrade off        method to assess physicians preference values for health        states associated with hepatitis B and HIV            Interestingly the median preference value for hepatitis C        without symptoms in our series was between that provided        for HBV without symptoms  and HIV without symptoms         in the previous study            The large range of physicians rating of treatment side        effects Figure  is striking and indicates that doctors        views about the impact of side effects on health status        vary substantially However the side effects of antiviral        therapy were judged severely overall with a median        preference value of  That is time on therapy was felt        to be associated with a  reduction from good health The        median preference value for treatment side effects was        similar to that provided for HSModerate Symptoms No        Cirrhosis        On average physicians indicated that they would require        a  sustained response before recommending therapy to        their patients The  threshold far exceeds the         sustained response rate to interferon and ribavirin therapy        reported for patients with hepatitis C genotype  infection             In fact only  of physicians reported a        threshold for recommending therapy of  or less The        unfavorable assessment of treatment side effects reported        by physicians in the current study provides one explanation        for relatively low referral rates for hepatitis C among        primary care providers A survey of primary care physicians        showed that only  refer antiHCV positive patients with        abnormal transaminase levels to subspecialists                   The lack of a significant correlation between the        respondents ratings of treatment side effects and their        thresholds for recommending treatment is surprising We        would expect clinicians to make decisions that are        consistent with their views on the harm and benefit of a        particular therapy Our data show that a group of        physicians comprised largely of primary care providers        would require a high degree of benefit in terms of response        rate to recommend therapy for HCV which was not        necessarily related to their perspectives on the harm        associated with treatment side effects The absence of such        a relationship may reflect limited knowledge about        hepatitis C and response rates to therapy or preconceived        notions about the disease and its treatment This finding        is particularly important because primary care providers        often decide whether to refer patients to a subspecialist        They also educate patients and shape their views about new        diagnoses Continuing education for physicians about the        natural history and treatment of hepatitis C is of key        importance in helping them to provide optimal advice to        their patients        Advances in antiviral therapy for hepatitis C will        affect how physicians and patients view the issue of        treatment Preliminary data suggest that the combination of        pegylated interferon and ribavirin will increase sustained        response rates to more than  overall and to greater        than  in patients with hepatitis C genotype  infection            Hepatologists need to understand other physicians        perspectives on hepatitis C so that they can adequately        address their concerns about treatment issues        Further work is needed to help physicians to understand        their patients views on hepatitis C A recent study showed        that persons with hepatitis C preferred to expedite periods        of poor health implying that they may be more likely to        proceed with antiviral therapy and its attendant side        effects than to delay treatment     In contrast the        physicians in the current survey had a relatively high        threshold for recommending treatment which would lead them        to postpone therapy in the majority of cases Utility        analysis may have a role in facilitating joint        decisionmaking between physicians and patients regarding        hepatitis C        This study does have limitations We studied a        convenience sample of physicians attending continuing        medical education lectures The findings could be biased        because we did not collect data on response rates or on the        demographic features of physicians who did not complete the        survey Furthermore although the study population        consisted largely of primary care providers some        subspecialists were included However the respondents do        represent a crosssection of physicians who may be involved        with the diagnosis of hepatitis C                    Conclusions        We have developed and evaluated health state        descriptions for hepatitis C Physicians felt that        hepatitis C health states were associated with a        substantial decrement in health status Physicians provided        particularly low preference values for side effects of        antiviral therapy and high thresholds for recommending        treatment However ratings of side effects were not        significantly correlated with thresholds for recommending        therapy suggesting that additional factors effect        physicians views about antiviral therapy The use of        utility analysis could provide a basis for shared        decisionmaking between patients and their physicians about        hepatitis C                    List of
