 All right I learned this story you know probably was about I was about 12 years old 12 or 11 somewhere around there you know elementary school about the time when Mom let you walk home from school or you know what I m saying you have a little bit of freedom on your own you know So the story uh was told to me by some of the older guys in the neighborhood about somebody that it happened to when he was our age It was during the summer probably let s see yeah it was 1986 cause I played football that year the summer of 1986 I remember cause I wore number 86 And uh the story was about Mr BHD that s what we called him And the reason why I got confused with the man in the black hat was because the man in the black hat was BHB The BHB is the Butt Hole Bandit and you know what I m saying it all started from the time where you know what I m saying And we d be walking home from school and we d see some man I I guess you know what I m saying somebody wore a black hat just looked creepy that you d never seen before So we were just like There goes the man with black hat Then come to find out that during that same summer this guy that played on our football team had supposedly was walking through the park Briarwood Park on um Plaza The same uh elementary school that we went to He was walking home from the basketball court and he supposedly got raped by this dude And you know what I m saying it was real gross because they went into details about him having to have stitches and all this stuff by this dude raping him He was supposedly this old man in a black hat and he walked around from neighborhood to neighborhood trying to follow kids And so we started right then calling so we started right then calling him The Butt Hole Bandit So you know what I m saying from then on you know for one the dude that uh supposedly gotten raped had disappeared you know what I m saying I mean he didn t disappear he had just like left town and so we really didn t know the truth We really didn t know if it really did happen we couldn t ask him You know being kids most likely we would have asked him you know what I m saying but during that summer he had disappeared He and his family had left or something like that so we just stayed up in the air whether it had happened or not So all the older guys and everybody was just like Man watch out for the guy with the black hat Watch out the for the BHB the Butt Hole Bandit So any time we saw people walking down the street that look didn t look familiar cause we had a pretty close knit community so we had people walking around the neighborhood or whatever you know what I m saying that looked funny everybody would be scared Everybody d go run in the house And we were some bad kids too I m talking about we was bad I m talking about throwing rocks at buses and doing a lot of stupid stuff but when it came to the BHB for real We watched out you know And we always played in the park used to run around the park or whatever but when it got dark nobody was out as far as by themselves and if you was out you better be in shape cause you re running I can remember running from it had to be at least a mile cause I ran through the woods from Orr Road to my house Orr Road right over there like going to UNCC to Hampshire Hill through the back way I had to go through the little sorry park in our neighborhood And I remember running the whole way and I wasn t even I wasn t in shape or nothing But it was just for the fear of the Butt Hole Bandit And you know what I m saying so then on you know what I m saying just like I said you had people looking for the people with the black hat and then anybody that came in our neighborhood we would just razz them And I remember one time we were picking on this dude who wanted to fight you know what I m saying we thought we were the stuff cause nobody could catch us on our bikes This dude was walking through our neighborhood and we started calling him the Butt Hole Bandit and whatnot and he started chasing us and he was saying he was the Butt Hole Bandit but he probably just saying it you know what I m saying to scare us even more So you know what I m saying he he really scared us and from then on you know what I m saying as we got older we still like right right when you know what I m saying I was was asked to tell the story you know what I m saying I asked my boy and he had so many stories about the Butt Hole Bandit He used to talk about how he s almost still scared of the Butt Hole Bandit cause nobody really knows you know what I m saying what happened to the little kid who supposedly got raped Well you know ain t nobody still seen him to this day but most likely probably if that did happen to him he s probably so embarrassed to come back around or whatever they probably moved away But I mean you know the Butt Hole Bandit story was was one of the biggest ones and it was the man in the black hat And you know kids we was playing sports always out at night being bad so you know what I m saying so anytime the Butt Hole Bandit came up everybody got tense Everybody was ready to go home Everybody was ready to go in somebody s house stay in or whatnot You used to purposely spend the night over to people s house cause you scared to walk home And say if it was like say eight houses down street either you were going to run or we were going to have our mom pick us up So you know what I m saying it was just really shook a whole bunch of us kids I mean that and I mean it probably probably didn t even happen at all It s like one of them little urban legends of of a man who went somewhere and did something bad and just really messed up the minds of all these kids but probably helped us you know what I m saying We didn t need to be out at night anyway But uh that s about it
