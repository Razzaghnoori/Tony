                     All right         I learned this story you know probably was about I was about  years old  or  somewhere around there you know elementary school about the time when Mom let you walk home from school or you know what Im saying you have a little bit of freedom on your own you know         So the story uh was told to me by some of the older guys in the neighborhood about somebody that it happened to when he was our age         It was during the summer probably lets see yeah it was  cause I played football that year the summer of          I remember cause I wore number          And uh the story was about Mr BHD thats what we called him         And the reason why I got confused with the man in the black hat was because the man in the black hat was BHB         The BHB is the Butt Hole Bandit and you know what Im saying it all started from the time where you know what Im saying         And wed be walking home from school and wed see some man         I I guess you know what Im saying somebody wore a black hat just looked creepy that youd never seen before         So we were just like There goes the man with black hat         Then come to find out that during that same summer this guy that played on our football team had supposedly was walking through the park Briarwood Park on um Plaza         The same uh elementary school that we went to         He was walking home from the basketball court and he supposedly got raped by this dude         And you know what Im saying it was real gross because they went into details about him having to have stitches and all this stuff by this dude raping him         He was supposedly this old man in a black hat and he walked around from neighborhood to neighborhood trying to follow kids         And so we started right then calling so we started right then calling him The Butt Hole Bandit                                                               So you know what Im saying from then on you know for one the dude that uh supposedly gotten raped had disappeared you know what Im saying I mean he didnt disappear he had just like left town and so we really didnt know the truth         We really didnt know if it really did happen we couldnt ask him         You know being kids most likely we would have asked him you know what Im saying but during that summer he had disappeared         He and his family had left or something like that so we just stayed up in the air whether it had happened or not         So all the older guys and everybody was just like Man watch out for the guy with the black hat         Watch out the for the BHB the Butt Hole Bandit         So any time we saw people walking down the street that look didnt look familiar cause we had a pretty close knit community so we had people walking around the neighborhood or whatever you know what Im saying that looked funny everybody would be scared         Everybodyd go run in the house         And we were some bad kids too         Im talking about we was bad Im talking about throwing rocks at buses and doing a lot of stupid stuff but when it came to the BHB                                                               for real         We watched out you know         And we always played in the park used to run around the park or whatever but when it got dark nobody was out as far as by themselves and if you was out you better be in shape cause youre running         I can remember running from it had to be at least a mile cause I ran through the woods from Orr Road to my house         Orr Road right over there like going to UNCC to Hampshire Hill through the back way         I had to go through the little sorry park in our neighborhood         And I remember running the whole way and I wasnt even I wasnt in shape or nothing         But it was just for the fear of the Butt Hole Bandit         And you know what Im saying so then on you know what Im saying just like I said you had people looking for the people with the black hat and then anybody that came in our neighborhood we would just razz them         And I remember one time we were picking on this dude who wanted to fight you know what Im saying we thought we were the stuff cause nobody could catch us on our bikes         This dude was walking through our neighborhood and we started calling him the Butt Hole Bandit and whatnot and he started chasing us and he was saying he was the Butt Hole Bandit                                                               but he probably just saying it                                       you know what Im saying to scare us even more         So you know what Im saying he he really scared us                                                               and from then on you know what Im saying as we got older we still like right right when you know what Im saying         I was was asked to tell the story you know what Im saying I asked my boy and he had so many stories about the Butt Hole Bandit         He used to talk about how hes almost still scared of the Butt Hole Bandit cause nobody really knows you know what Im saying what happened to the little kid who supposedly got raped         Well you know aint nobody still seen him to this day but most likely probably if that did happen to him hes probably so embarrassed to come back around or whatever they probably moved away         But I mean you know the Butt Hole Bandit story was was one of the biggest ones and it was the man in the black hat         And you know kids we was playing sports always out at night being bad so you know what Im saying so anytime the Butt Hole Bandit came up everybody got tense         Everybody was ready to go home         Everybody was ready to go in somebodys house stay in or whatnot         You used to purposely spend the night over to peoples house cause you scared to walk home         And say if it was like say eight houses down street either you were going to run or we were going to have our mom pick us up         So you know what Im saying it was just really shook a whole bunch of us kids         I mean that and I mean it probably probably didnt even happen at all         Its like one of them little urban legends of of a man who went somewhere and did something bad and just really messed up the minds of all these kids but probably helped us you know what Im saying         We didnt need to be out at night anyway         But uh thats about it
