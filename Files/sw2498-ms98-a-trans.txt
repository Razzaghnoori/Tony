        you can go ahead and start if you want uh   well um the budgets an interesting issue uh particularly since im pretty much a libertarian and an anachro libertarian at that uh so i would basically say the way to fix the budget is to uh cut and eliminate taxes charge user fees for things that uh are absolutely necessary and to be allocated fairly that way and um id say ninety percent of the budget has no business being there   i can agree with that and uh i know one thing we we need to do a lot of spending cuts instead a lot of raising taxes because thats whats really  hurting everybodys goat   uhhuh   uh   yeah i think i think a lot of people fail to realize but you know the government doesnt generate money you know they may print it but thats not really the way money is made its its made from people working and doing things that are productive and governments the net cost   and government doesnt produce anything   thats right so uh a dollar tax isnt isnt a dollar that can be you know that that makes more bread or anything else its uh its lost   correct that uh i guess the uh the big thing about that is the fact that theyre spending someone elses money its not like its theyre out of their own savings account   uhhuh uhhuh   and thats another quagmire that really hurts us   absolutely   yeah   yeah i mean its its real easy when you go home and and you think gee you know id like to have a mansion and a yacht isnt it nice i can make my neighbors pay for it     uhhuh   but but uh you know i mean the real world doesnt work like that or at least it shouldnt but it seems to in government     isnt the basic needs of the government in the first place is to protect and what is the other one basic services is to protect and i dont know about providing all the other services that they do i mean even i i guess the uh the latest uh fire they came under was whenever they were providing a uh a tribute to um Lawrence Welk   hum oh thats right   contributing five hundred thousand to   thats right   restoration to his home i think that was called back because of all the flack they received but but thats the another one of the big examples of why were in such dilemma   uhhuh well even just the general funding for the arts uh in humanities and then you know they get into these censorship issues and everything else i mean   right   the arts in humanity should be privately funded   i agree   um a lot of these social welfare programs i mean thats why theyre things like United Way is when you and i think that those are important but we give our dollars to them and it shouldnt be a government responsibility   uhhuh   but the government i think is supposed to be doing is is defending our rights   right   no more and no less   and the power given to the IRS is just astronomical and   oh yeah thats awful   when you sign your ten forty form youre signing a away youre rights i mean your your rights to uh uh protect yourself   uhhuh   and that shouldnt be that way either uh the power given to those people is just well beyond it should be   uhhuh   and uh the really what given it was given to them by Congress   yeah but Congress never really had the right to give it to them is the is the real argument   right   um yeah its its so i dont know i mean so it i mean getting back to the budget its i guess the the fundamental thing is to give people a concrete get people to agree on a concrete idea of just exactly what government is supposed to be doing for them no more no less and cut government back down to that size     yeah its its its an enormous  enormous bureaucracy though its going to take probably years to really get that in to order too   uhhuh     because everybody will want that pet project   oh sure and and theres going to be a lot of you know cover your ass and you know well you can cut his program but not mine and       and entrenched bureaucrats that dont want to loose their jobs   correct and all the uh unnecessary military installations   yep yep   will have to be probably scrapped   uhhuh   but thats going to be difficult   uhhuh   but   we may we may need a constitutional convention   really the biggest way yeah uh probably will its the only way its going to change is for us to have a better budget for running this country is for everybody to get involved and right now i dont see that happening   yep   not at the moment   uhhuh   or not at this short time period   right i agree   so my you have some pretty good ideas there um   well its been nice talking to somebody with who uh  basically agrees with me   yeah well im um   i voted libertarian this last election i mean in most uh   did you   some of the boxes you know   uhhuh   im really am interested in getting most of the incumbents out   yeah absolutely i think the republic rats have uh driven this country downhill for too long   yeah well all parties too are responsible its not just one particular one   right thats why i said republic rat   oh i see i see     yeah     well now that we have aired our views in such an open way   yeah       well it was good talking to you   you too have fun up there   you too   hope to talk to you again maybe   okeydoke byebye
