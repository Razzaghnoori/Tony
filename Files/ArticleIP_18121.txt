 Blacklist and Backstory A couple of weeks ago the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced that it would award an honorary Oscar to the director Elia Kazan What was surprising about this news was the amount of controversy it generated virtually none For decades Kazan has been reviled as the most notorious of those who named names identified Communists working in Hollywood before the House Committee on Un American Activities In recent years both the American Film Institute and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association have turned Kazan down for honors that no one disputes are merited by his films which include East of Eden and A Streetcar Named Desire But this time the vote in Kazan s favor was unanimous Reporters looking to reprise the old conflict had a hard time finding anyone who still bears him a grudge Why have Kazan s enemies suddenly dropped their complaint Several articles on the subject have ritually invoked the end of the Cold War as an explanation But it s not clear why the collapse of Communism should smooth matters over Many wars end in a reckoning rather than in forgiveness and forgetting A more plausible explanation is probably that Kazan now 89 has outlived most of his antagonists and that the fury of the rest has lost its edge It may indeed be time to excuse Kazan for what he did in 1952 But if so it shouldn t happen because no one can be troubled to remember or sort out the morality of his actions A synopsis In the 1930s Kazan got his start in the Group Theater a left wing theater troupe that was home to the legendary directors Lee Strasberg and Harold Clurman as well as the radical playwright Clifford Odets For a year and a half Kazan was a member of a Communist cell inside the Group He quit after members of the cell received orders to take over the theater and turn it into an actors collective Despite his resignation expulsion Kazan remained sympathetic to the Soviet Union into the 1940s when he began directing Hollywood films But that sympathy was long gone by 1952 when he was called before HUAC The first time he testified in January Kazan took a principled position He would discuss his own involvement in the party but not the others who had been in it with him So the committee called him back to Washington and put him under oath Under pressure from the FBI and the movie studios he reversed himself Since the committee already knew the names it wanted naming names was a loyalty test and humiliation ritual not part of a real investigation There is a chilling Darkness at Noon quality to Kazan s questioning by Frank Tavenner Jr a lawyer for the committee Tavenner I understand that you have voluntarily requested the committee to reopen your hearing and give you an opportunity to explain fully the participation of others known to you at the time to have been members of the Communist Party Kazan That is correct I want to make a full and complete statement I want to tell you everything I know about it Kazan s prepared statement offered up the names of the eight others who were members of his Group Theater cell The names included Odets who subsequently named names himself and several actors since forgotten in part perhaps because they were blacklisted It was not just his testimony that made Kazan into a Linda Tripp figure of his time After all Odets gave HUAC the same names as did Lewis Leverett another Group Theater alumnus whom Kazan named But many others who named names did so under ostensible protest or later castigated themselves publicly for crawling before the committee Kazan embraced his inquisitors Soon after he testified he took out an ad in the New York Times to defend himself I believe that any American who is in possession of such facts has the obligation to make them known either to the public or to the appropriate Government agency he wrote Whatever hysteria exists and there is some particularly in Hollywood is inflamed by mystery suspicion and secrecy Hard and exact facts will cool it Kazan made his case more memorably in the 1954 film On the Waterfront in which Marlon Brando plays a longshoreman faced with a choice about whether to rat on the murderous and corrupt leadership of his union His decision to testify is portrayed as an act of courageous whistle blowing not betrayal or cowardice For years afterward Kazan kept his silence about the episode I don t think there s anything in my life toward which I have more ambivalence because obviously there s something disgusting about giving other people s names he acknowledged in a 1971 interview But he also refused to apologize and defended his choice In his fascinating autobiography published in 1988 Kazan expresses a range of justifications He wasn t telling the committee any names it didn t know as an immigrant he was eager to demonstrate his patriotism he was faced with a choice of two evils Did he do wrong The first question to ask is what the right thing would have been Kazan might have stood by his original policy asserting that while he hated Communism he would not assist in a violation of civil liberties Kazan s soon to be ex friend Arthur Miller did something like this four years later when he refused to answer questions Miller claimed the First Amendment right to freedom of speech and association rather than taking the Fifth right against self incrimination This was the more principled stand since taking the Fifth implied agreeing that simply being a Communist was a crime Also there is no Fifth Amendment right against incriminating others Unfortunately the Supreme Court had never ruled that the First Amendment could be used in this way With McCarthyism much weaker by 1956 Miller avoided prison and continued to have his plays produced But for Kazan to take Miller s stance before HUAC in 1952 would almost certainly have meant a contempt citation and time in jail Kazan would not have made films for many years if ever again For a great artist like Kazan to immolate himself to protect the rights of lesser artists or more precisely in a quixotic attempt to protect those rights would have been heroic But failing to be a hero did not make him a villain The villains were the blacklisters Kazan was one of their victims But failing to be a villain doesn t make him a hero either Where Kazan did go wrong was in casting an evil he couldn t avoid as a good His statement that the facts about Communism were the cure for anti Communist hysteria was disingenuous The real cure for anti Communist hysteria was a courage that Kazan like most people did not possess But this bit of gratuitous groveling pales next to the sins of others both those who remained Stalinists into the 1950s and those who did not just acquiesce in but advocated McCarthyism For the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences which actually enforced the blacklist to reject Kazan for his comparatively minor offenses would have been the sheerest hypocrisy Some historians have argued recently that new information makes all forms of American anti Communism including even McCarthyism look better in hindsight They contend that the so called Venona intercepts a few of which have been released show definitively not only that Alger Hiss and the Rosenbergs were spies but also that there was far more Soviet string pulling behind American Communism than anyone ever knew But none of these revelations improves the case that Hollywood Communism was a significant threat to democracy Murray Kempton got this story right in 1955 in his book Part of Our Time The Hollywood Communists most of them screenwriters were overpaid hacks not dangerous revolutionaries The examples of propaganda they slipped into scripts are few and laughable The high point of Kempton s essay on the Hollywood 10 is a list of the folderol the blacklisted screenwriters actually produced with excerpts from the glowing reviews they received from the Daughters of the American Revolution Elia Kazan wasn t a hack and he didn t try to be a hero He deserves an Oscar as much as anyone living for best director not for best human being Who in the movie industry qualifies for that second one anyway
