 Trippin at the GNC Throw out your dealer s telephone number why take risks when your supermarket is selling drugs OK not real drugs but nutritional supplements which are winning over our drug abuse dollar Corner stores now stock Saint Johnswort Snapples come spiked with ginseng and juice bars sprinkle ginkgo on smoothies Supplements are an 8 9 billion annual business now bigger than the domestic box office of movies Largely unregulated by the Food and Drug Administration these over the counter compounds are legal for 12 year olds to buy But can they get you wasted Over the summer I ran up a tab at my local General Nutrition Center a chain with booming sales growth largely because it rounds up the usual supplements After sampling GNC s wares I checked my findings against the wisdom of Ray Sahelian M D a Los Angeles doctor who swears by supplements has tried them all and has authored several books on the matter Here s what I learned Saint Johnswort For Mild to serious depression How it works It s a flower Studies suggest it like everything halfway fun these days plays with neurotransmitter levels boosting serotonin norepinephrine and dopamine My findings The bottle recommended one to three 300 milligram pills per day I took three On the afternoon of the third day it takes a while for the drug to rev up I felt a sudden rush of well being I was reading a good book and eating a great sandwich and admittedly this in itself may account for my good cheer But it felt more profound what should have been just a sandwich was a sandwich what should have been just a book was a book Does that make sense It did at the time By Day 4 the manic rushes were kicking in At unpredictable moments I d become hypersocial expansive and breathtakingly productive It was not unlike a cocaine high er I m told That is a surprise cocaine high that strikes at random I d be in a meeting with my boss and suddenly I was Robin Williams circa 1980 These Wort flashes were sort of delightful the first few times but I grew to fear them I couldn t predict when the Wort would attack And along with the manic highs came troughs of fragility and moodiness Hoping to push the envelope I eventually doubled my dosage Result a jaw clenching headache of unfathomable depth coupled with horrid abyss gazing doubt and need I quit the next day The doc says Sahelian s a big fan of the Wort He thinks it works almost as well as Prozac without the side effects or high price Doesn t it add a little magic to the world It s great to take when traveling the things you see become more special I d guess he means something like my sandwich moment Sahelian says that since I wasn t depressed to start with taking the maximum dosage of Wort pushed me into mania He starts patients off with one pill a day and only goes to three for extreme depression Oops Although I m not depressed I may try a one per day regimen in the future maybe I could be even happier Cost 7 99 for 60 pills a two month supply for me a 20 day supply for Sylvia Plath Melatonin For Insomnia and jet lag It s nature s sleeping pill How it works Melatonin is a natural hormone produced by the pineal gland that seems to regulate your internal clock My findings I get insomnia so I was excited about melatonin The bottle suggested one 3 milligram tablet before bedtime I obeyed but nothing happened I was still sleepless Instead I felt sluggish the entire next day Results were no better on subsequent nights A few nights in I had a vivid nightmare I was at a picnic where people played a game a game in which they attempted to flay each other using hand held metal hooks stripping skin away from their ribs and spines I quit the next day The doc says 3 milligrams a night is waaaaay too much He recommends a half milligram to 1 milligram one hour before bed no more than once a week Vivid dreams are common dreams like you ve never dreamed before says the doc and I concur but so is restful sleep Cost 3 69 for 60 tablets of 3 milligrams each Kava Kava For Anxiety How it works Who knows It s a plant from the pepper family and its roots may affect your limbic system My findings I bought kava in liquid extract form to be taken with an eyedropper The label said 3 milliliters three times daily I took 9 milliliters all at once No dice Then I took 12 milliliters all at once Less dice if that s possible Finally I took 15 milliliters all at once five times the suggested dosage Beyond a teensy sense of detachment and some mild balance problems I still felt nothing The doc says Sahelian author of Kava The Anti Anxiety Herb tells me that with kava the brand makes a huge difference Indeed on the Lycaeum Trip Reports page one psychonaut recommends Waka grade Kava from Fiji Mine came from Nature s Way Products in Springville Utah Sahelian says If you re not anxious you won t notice much But those who like it really like it It s great if you re nervous going on a plane or to the dentist or before a party Some use it as an alternative to the evening martini A mischievous friend swears that if you slug back a whole bottle you ll act like Dopey dwarf for a few hours but I cannot confirm at this time Cost 9 75 for 59 milliliters of extract SAMe For Depression And arthritis How it works Again with the dopamine Like melatonin SAMe is found in the body My findings I don t have arthritis I also don t have depression but that never stopped me before The bottle said one to four 100 milligram pills per day I took four every day I felt nothing The doc says Despite the slobber of media excitement dripped all over SAMe in the last few months Sahelian prefers Saint Johnswort The Wort is much less expensive and he thinks it works better When I sounded disappointed about SAMe he offered this tip If you want to feel something try taking three or four pills in the morning on an empty stomach I tried the next morning More nothing Cost Yow 24 99 for 30 100 milligram tablets At four a day that s 25 beans for little more than a week s worth Gi nseng Ginkgo Biloba and Echinacea For Ginseng s for vitality ginkgo s for mental alertness and Echinacea s for stopping colds How they work allegedly Ginseng improves adrenal gland function ginkgo helps circulation and Echinacea boosts white blood cells They re all herbs My findings I bought Siberian ginseng gum and chewed a bunch but felt no particular vitality So Pros none Cons acrid aftertaste acrid duringtaste zero vitality increase and I had to find somewhere to spit it out If you want to try ginseng Siberian is supposedly the best as opposed to Asian or American I also took ginkgo I also felt nothing As for Echinacea I ve used it successfully a few times though not in a controlled study The key is to take it just as you re getting a cold it appears to head it off Friends have reported similar success The doc says Sahelian seemed less enthusiastic about these He says effectiveness varies dramatically between brands and that ginkgo shows more impact on older people improving focus and alertness Cost 1 29 for a pack of ginseng gum 15 for a few months supply of ginkgo and 19 for a big bottle of Echinacea Conclusion The Wort can be fun and it might save you a bundle on your Prozac bill I m willing to give melatonin another shot too at reduced dosage But basically this stuff is all weak sauce If you re looking for drugs to improve your mood or mental alertness don t throw out your dealer s number just yet The drugs that come closest to achieving these worthy goals remain highly illegal or must be prescribed by a doctor The success of GNC and the nutritional supplement industry illustrates how eager our culture is to embrace mood altering drugs as long as they don t actually work
