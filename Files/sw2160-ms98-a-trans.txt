 hello hello there did i reach the Dallas area i beg your pardon did i reach the Dallas area nope you ve reached Dayton Ohio Dayton Ohio i m from North Carolina oh you re from North Carolina where in North Carolina in Raleigh Raleigh great my name s Mary yeah so my name is Fernando Fernando glad to know you so um do you work how d you find out about this uh i was visiting my son down in Dallas oh okay he works for TI and uh no no but his wife has a contract with TI and that s how we learned about it um hum oh okay because i m down at NC State yeah um hum and so i took a class and he said sign up and get some money and just talk for five minutes right so are you ready i m ready okay let s get started all right okay okay so uh what do you think uh that uh what what what what do you think we can do to solve the crime in America oh if i knew that i d be a very wealthy person yeah but what what what are the steps well you have to see i a as the way i look at it you have to think first of all why or has has crime increased and if so why has crime increased well see the problem is is that um what happens is as that you re uh you know as you go from the country to a city crime always increases right because in the country people still respect uh the property of other people um hum right and so as as and the people in the country don t want as much as the people in the city um hum now what happens is all those that don t have any money in the country move to the cities and they wish to get the same thing they say why can t we have the same things that these other people have and the thing that we can do is we need money for drugs and what we have to do is we have to go there get some stuff steal it and then you know resell it it s easy you said the magic word there drugs which one yeah and that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased that s uh that s uh the main reason i think uh everywhere because uh you have deaths i mean i mean you have murders and you have you know people stealing other people s stuff and that s a lot of it has to do with drugs oh yes it doesn t have to do i mean the thing is is that you know it s like you might be standing somewhere right and like let s say you re you you go you know you re driving out and you re driving back home and it s late at night and you stop by one of these you know twenty four hour you know gas stations joints yeah and uh somebody walks in there with a gun i mean they re going to want the money and you can tell by the people who are always caught that these people are there to get money for drugs i mean they don t want the money so uh so they can do something else with it now they don t want the money for food that s for sure right right and so well but you know the the strange thing uh perhaps not strange but something that many people don t realize is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty one and fifty two and find that there were drug dealers um hum at that time trying to influence the high school kids because uh i m a retired educator okay and uh in fifty one and fifty two the police came to the high school where i was and were telling us how to recognize when kids were on drugs how to recognize the pushers outside the one entrance that they were giving their drugs away in order to get the kids started and so on and so on yeah so it s a problem that s been around for over forty years and we re just really uh uh now trying to uh figure out how to cope with the problem because it has grown so huge yeah there s a there s a a song that i know which says you know that it s like in uh nineteen eighty eight nineteen eighty nine the local state and federal governments spent the least amount of money on crime in America hm and uh i their figures i think are true so i mean it s like compared to you know compared to weapons and stuff like that i mean you re spending nothing on on crime in the country itself what you re doing is you you know it s like you have other things you know it s like you have the AIDS we re going to solve try to solve the AIDS problem while while you know some people are getting killed here and there and then uh huh you know the uh another one of the problems is that the people who are the dealers the big dealers in drugs may be may be part of the power structure that s keeping us from spending the money in that direction uh huh but those people never get caught the people that that s right they ll never get caught that that i see their theory is that if i m surrounded and i m going to be caught i m going to try to pry my way through and they re not going to take me alive um hum but i have such a big army outside of my place that nobody can touch me that s right but they ll you know it s like of course i mean i might be you know the the leading drug dealer here but you won t find me dealing in drugs i mean there s no connection between me and the people that you caught you know that s right that s right then one person doesn t know the other person down the line right but the guy at the very top the one who s who s really making the millions and the millions is the one who also many times is part of the power structure uh the uh and had the political uh pull to keep things from uh keep the interest or the uh emphasis in some other direction other than on the drug dealing because it sure is monstrous in this country yeah yeah i was i was at a at a party on Saturday and this guy comes up he goes hey how you doing whatever and then he started talking to me and this guy was from Jamaica right and he s got his little brother selling drugs um hum um hum you know and he goes yeah i just came up here to work and i go oh you did i bet you make uh very good money up here he goes yeah i make a lot a lot of money he goes you know and uh in the movie Good Fellas yeah right did you see it nope i only heard about it okay in one part the guy goes out of jail and within uh two months he had all his house payments done everything paid and you know and he had enough money to you know it s like um hum those guys at one point you know they had so much money that they didn t know what to do with it yeah well you know even in our prison systems they re finding that they re they re having drugs smuggled into them yeah yeah that s that that was also in the movie yeah right so hello Mary it s been nice talking we ve been talking for five minutes it was i beg your we ve been talking for a little bit i appreciate the call i enjoyed talking with you all right okay same here bye bye uh huh bye bye
