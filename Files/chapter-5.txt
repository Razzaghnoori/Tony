 AL QAEDA AIMS AT THE AMERICAN HOMELAND TERRORIST ENTREPRENEURS By early 1999 al Qaeda was already a potent adversary of the United States Bin Ladin and his chief of operations Abu Hafs al Masri also known as Mohammed Atef occupied undisputed leadership positions atop al Qaeda s organizational structure Within this structure al Qaeda s worldwide terrorist operations relied heavily on the ideas and work of enterprising and strongwilled field commanders who enjoyed considerable autonomy To understand how the organization actually worked and to introduce the origins of the 9 11 plot we briefly examine three of these subordinate commanders Khalid Sheikh Mohammed KSM Riduan Isamuddin better known as Hambali and Abd al Rahim al Nashiri We will devote the most attention to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed the chief manager of the planes operation Khalid Sheikh Mohammed No one exemplifies the model of the terrorist entrepreneur more clearly than Khalid Sheikh Mohammed the principal architect of the 9 11 attacks KSM followed a rather tortuous path to his eventual membership in al Qaeda Highly educated and equally comfortable in a government office or a terrorist safehouse KSM applied his imagination technical aptitude and managerial skills to hatching and planning an extraordinary array of terrorist schemes These ideas included conventional car bombing political assassination aircraft bombing hijacking reservoir poisoning and ultimately the use of aircraft as missiles guided by suicide operatives Like his nephew Ramzi Yousef three years KSM s junior KSM grew up in Kuwait but traces his ethnic lineage to the Baluchistan region straddling Iran and Pakistan Raised in a religious family KSM claims to have joined the Muslim Brotherhood at age 16 and to have become enamored of violent jihad at youth camps in the desert In 1983 following his graduation from secondary school KSM left Kuwait to enroll at Chowan College a small Baptist school in Murfreesboro North Carolina After a semester at Chowan KSM transferred to North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro which he attended with Yousef s brother another future al Qaeda member KSM earned a degree in mechanical engineering in December 1986 Although he apparently did not attract attention for extreme Islamist beliefs or activities while in the United States KSM plunged into the anti Soviet Afghan jihad soon after graduating from college Visiting Pakistan for the first time in early 1987 he traveled to Peshawar where his brother Zahid introduced him to the famous Afghan mujahid Abdul Rasul Sayyaf head of the Hizbul Ittihad El Islami Islamic Union Party Sayyaf became KSM s mentor and provided KSM with military training at Sayyaf s Sada camp KSM claims he then fought the Soviets and remained at the front for three months before being summoned to perform administrative duties for Abdullah Azzam KSM next took a job working for an electronics firm that catered to the communications needs of Afghan groups where he learned about drills used to excavate caves in Afghanistan Between 1988 and 1992 KSM helped run a nongovernmental organization NGO in Peshawar and Jalalabad sponsored by Sayyaf it was designed to aid young Afghan mujahideen In 1992 KSM spent some time fighting alongside the mujahideen in Bosnia and supporting that effort with financial donations After returning briefly to Pakistan he moved his family to Qatar at the suggestion of the former minister of Islamic affairs of Qatar Sheikh Abdallah bin Khalid bin Hamad al Thani KSM took a position in Qatar as project engineer with the Qatari Ministry of Electricity and Water Although he engaged in extensive international travel during his tenure at the ministry much of it in furtherance of terrorist activity KSM would hold his position there until early 1996 when he fled to Pakistan to avoid capture by U S authorities KSM first came to the attention of U S law enforcement as a result of his cameo role in the first World Trade Center bombing According to KSM he learned of Ramzi Yousef s intention to launch an attack inside the United States in 1991 or 1992 when Yousef was receiving explosives training in Afghanistan During the fall of 1992 while Yousef was building the bomb he would use in that attack KSM and Yousef had numerous telephone conversations during which Yousef discussed his progress and sought additional funding On November 3 1992 KSM wired 660 from Qatar to the bank account of Yousef s co conspirator Mohammed Salameh KSM does not appear to have contributed any more substantially to this operation Yousef s instant notoriety as the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing inspired KSM to become involved in planning attacks against the United States By his own account KSM s animus toward the United States stemmed not from his experiences there as a student but rather from his violent disagreement with U S foreign policy favoring Israel In 1994 KSM accompanied Yousef to the Philippines and the two of them began planning what is now known as the Manila air or Bojinka plot the intended bombing of 12 U S commercial jumbo jets over the Pacific during a two day span This marked the first time KSM took part in the actual planning of a terrorist operation While sharing an apartment in Manila during the summer of 1994 he and Yousef acquired chemicals and other materials necessary to construct bombs and timers They also cased target flights to Hong Kong and Seoul that would have onward legs to the United States During this same period KSM and Yousef also developed plans to assassinate President Clinton during his November 1994 trip to Manila and to bomb U S bound cargo carriers by smuggling jackets containing nitrocellulose on board KSM left the Philippines in September 1994 and met up with Yousef in Karachi following their casing flights There they enlisted Wali Khan Amin Shah also known as Usama Asmurai in the Manila air plot During the fall of 1994 Yousef returned to Manila and successfully tested the digital watch timer he had invented bombing a movie theater and a Philippine Airlines flight en route to Tokyo The plot unraveled after the Philippine authorities discovered Yousef s bomb making operation in Manila but by that time KSM was safely back at his government job in Qatar Yousef attempted to follow through on the cargo carriers plan but he was arrested in Islamabad by Pakistani authorities on February 7 1995 after an accomplice turned him in KSM continued to travel among the worldwide jihadist community after Yousef s arrest visiting the Sudan Yemen Malaysia and Brazil in 1995 No clear evidence connects him to terrorist activities in those locations While in Sudan he reportedly failed in his attempt to meet with Bin Ladin But KSM did see Atef who gave him a contact in Brazil In January 1996 well aware that U S authorities were chasing him he left Qatar for good and fled to Afghanistan where he renewed his relationship with Rasul Sayyaf Just as KSM was reestablishing himself in Afghanistan in mid 1996 Bin Ladin and his colleagues were also completing their migration from Sudan Through Atef KSM arranged a meeting with Bin Ladin inTora Bora a mountainous redoubt from the Afghan war days At the meeting KSM presented the al Qaeda leader with a menu of ideas for terrorist operations According to KSM this meeting was the first time he had seen Bin Ladin since 1989 Although they had fought together in 1987 Bin Ladin and KSM did not yet enjoy an especially close working relationship Indeed KSM has acknowledged that Bin Ladin likely agreed to meet with him because of the renown of his nephew Yousef At the meeting KSM briefed Bin Ladin and Atef on the first World Trade Center bombing the Manila air plot the cargo carriers plan and other activities pursued by KSM and his colleagues in the Philippines KSM also presented a proposal for an operation that would involve training pilots who would crash planes into buildings in the United States This proposal eventually would become the 9 11 operation KSM knew that the successful staging of such an attack would require personnel money and logistical support that only an extensive and well funded organization like al Qaeda could provide He thought the operation might appeal to Bin Ladin who had a long record of denouncing the United States From KSM s perspective Bin Ladin was in the process of consolidating his new position in Afghanistan while hearing out others ideas and had not yet settled on an agenda for future anti U S operations At the meeting Bin Ladin listened to KSM s ideas without much comment but did ask KSM formally to join al Qaeda and move his family to Afghanistan KSM declined He preferred to remain independent and retain the option of working with other mujahideen groups still operating in Afghanistan including the group led by his old mentor Sayyaf Sayyaf was close to Ahmed Shah Massoud the leader of the Northern Alliance Therefore working with him might be a problem for KSM because Bin Ladin was building ties to the rival Taliban After meeting with Bin Ladin KSM says he journeyed onward to India Indonesia and Malaysia where he met with Jemaah Islamiah s Hambali Hambali was an Indonesian veteran of the Afghan war looking to expand the jihad into Southeast Asia In Iran KSM rejoined his family and arranged to move them to Karachi he claims to have relocated by January 1997 After settling his family in Karachi KSM tried to join the mujahid leader Ibn al Khattab in Chechnya Unable to travel through Azerbaijan KSM returned to Karachi and then to Afghanistan to renew contacts with Bin Ladin and his colleagues Though KSM may not have been a member of al Qaeda at this time he admits traveling frequently between Pakistan and Afghanistan in 1997 and the first half of 1998 visiting Bin Ladin and cultivating relationships with his lieutenants Atef and Sayf al Adl by assisting them with computer and media projects According to KSM the 1998 bombings of the U S embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam marked a watershed in the evolution of the 9 11 plot KSM claims these bombings convinced him that Bin Ladin was truly committed to attacking the United States He continued to make himself useful collecting news articles and helping other al Qaeda members with their outdated computer equipment Bin Ladin apparently at Atef s urging finally decided to give KSM the green light for the 9 11 operation sometime in late 1998 or early 1999 KSM then accepted Bin Ladin s standing invitation to move to Kandahar and work directly with al Qaeda In addition to supervising the planning and preparations for the 9 11 operation KSM worked with and eventually led al Qaeda s media committee But KSM states he refused to swear a formal oath of allegiance to Bin Ladin thereby retaining a last vestige of his cherished autonomy At this point late 1998 to early 1999 planning for the 9 11 operation began in earnest Yet while the 9 11 project occupied the bulk of KSM s attention he continued to consider other possibilities for terrorist attacks For example he sent al Qaeda operative Issa al Britani to Kuala Lumpur Malaysia to learn about the jihad in Southeast Asia from Hambali Thereafter KSM claims at Bin Ladin s direction in early 2001 he sent Britani to the United States to case potential economic and Jewish targets in New York City Furthermore during the summer of 2001 KSM approached Bin Ladin with the idea of recruiting a Saudi Arabian air force pilot to commandeer a Saudi fighter jet and attack the Israeli city of Eilat Bin Ladin reportedly liked this proposal but he instructed KSM to concentrate on the 9 11 operation first Similarly KSM s proposals to Atef around this same time for attacks in Thailand Singapore Indonesia and the Maldives were never executed although Hambali s Jemaah Islamiah operatives did some casing of possible targets KSM appears to have been popular among the al Qaeda rank and file He was reportedly regarded as an effective leader especially after the 9 11 attacks Co workers describe him as an intelligent efficient and even tempered manager who approached his projects with a single minded dedication that he expected his colleagues to share Al Qaeda associate Abu Zubaydah has expressed more qualified admiration for KSM s innate creativity emphasizing instead his ability to incorporate the improvements suggested by others Nashiri has been similarly measured observing that although KSM floated many general ideas for attacks he rarely conceived a specific operation himself 19 Perhaps these estimates reflect a touch of jealousy in any case KSM was plainly a capable coordinator having had years to hone his skills and build relationships Hambali Al Qaeda s success in fostering terrorism in Southeast Asia stems largely from its close relationship with Jemaah Islamiah JI In that relationship Hambali became the key coordinator Born and educated in Indonesia Hambali moved to Malaysia in the early 1980s to find work There he claims to have become a follower of the Islamist extremist teachings of various clerics including one named Abdullah Sungkar Sungkar first inspired Hambali to share the vision of establishing a radical Islamist regime in Southeast Asia then furthered Hambali s instruction in jihad by sending him to Afghanistan in 1986 After undergoing training at Rasul Sayyaf s Sada camp where KSM would later train Hambali fought against the Soviets he eventually returned to Malaysia after 18 months in Afghanistan By 1998 Hambali would assume responsibility for the Malaysia Singapore region within Sungkar s newly formed terrorist organization the JI Also by 1998 Sungkar and JI spiritual leader Abu Bakar Bashir had accepted Bin Ladin s offer to ally JI with al Qaeda in waging war against Christians and Jews Hambali met with KSM in Karachi to arrange for JI members to receive training in Afghanistan at al Qaeda s camps In addition to his close working relationship with KSM Hambali soon began dealing with Atef as well Al Qaeda began funding JI s increasingly ambitious terrorist plans which Atef and KSM sought to expand Under this arrangement JI would perform the necessary casing activities and locate bomb making materials and other supplies Al Qaeda would underwrite operations provide bomb making expertise and deliver suicide operatives The al Qaeda JI partnership yielded a number of proposals that would marry al Qaeda s financial and technical strengths with JI s access to materials and local operatives Here Hambali played the critical role of coordinator as he distributed al Qaeda funds earmarked for the joint operations In one especially notable example Atef turned to Hambali when al Qaeda needed a scientist to take over its biological weapons program Hambali obliged by introducing a U S educated JI member Yazid Sufaat to Ayman al Zawahiri in Kandahar In 2001 Sufaat would spend several months attempting to cultivate anthrax for al Qaeda in a laboratory he helped set up near the Kandahar airport Hambali did not originally orient JI s operations toward attacking the United States but his involvement with al Qaeda appears to have inspired him to pursue American targets KSM in his post capture interrogations has taken credit for this shift claiming to have urged the JI operations chief to concentrate on attacks designed to hurt the U S economy Hambali s newfound interest in striking against the United States manifested itself in a spate of terrorist plans Fortunately none came to fruition In addition to staging actual terrorist attacks in partnership with al Qaeda Hambali and JI assisted al Qaeda operatives passing through Kuala Lumpur One important occasion was in December 1999 January 2000 Hambali accommodated KSM s requests to help several veterans whom KSM had just finished training in Karachi They included Tawfiq bin Attash also known as Khallad who later would help bomb the USS Cole and future 9 11 hijackers Nawaf al Hazmi and Khalid al Mihdhar Hambali arranged lodging for them and helped them purchase airline tickets for their onward travel Later that year Hambali and his crew would provide accommodations and other assistance including information on flight schools and help in acquiring ammonium nitrate for Zacarias Moussaoui an al Qaeda operative sent to Malaysia by Atef and KSM Hambali used Bin Ladin s Afghan facilities as a training ground for JI recruits Though he had a close relationship with Atef and KSM he maintained JI s institutional independence from al Qaeda Hambali insists that he did not discuss operations with Bin Ladin or swear allegiance to him having already given such a pledge of loyalty to Bashir Sungkar s successor as JI leader Thus like any powerful bureaucrat defending his domain Hambali objected when al Qaeda leadership tried to assign JI members to terrorist projects without notifying him Abd al Rahim al Nashiri KSM and Hambali both decided to join forces with al Qaeda because their terrorist aspirations required the money and manpower that only a robust organization like al Qaeda could supply On the other hand Abd al Rahim al Nashiri the mastermind of the Cole bombing and the eventual head of al Qaeda operations in the Arabian Peninsula appears to have originally been recruited to his career as a terrorist by Bin Ladin himself Having already participated in the Afghan jihad Nashiri accompanied a group of some 30 mujahideen in pursuit of jihad in Tajikistan in 1996 When serious fighting failed to materialize the group traveled to Jalalabad and encountered Bin Ladin who had recently returned from Sudan Bin Ladin addressed them at length urging the group to join him in a jihad against the Americans Although all were urged to swear loyalty to Bin Ladin many including Nashiri found the notion distasteful and refused After several days of indoctrination that included a barrage of news clippings and television documentaries Nashiri left Afghanistan first returning to his native Saudi Arabia and then visiting his home in Yemen There he says the idea for his first terrorist operation took shape as he noticed many U S and other foreign ships plying the waters along the southwest coast of Yemen Nashiri returned to Afghanistan probably in 1997 primarily to check on relatives fighting there and also to learn about the Taliban He again encountered Bin Ladin still recruiting for the coming battle with the United States Nashiri pursued a more conventional military jihad joining the Taliban forces in their fight against Ahmed Massoud s Northern Alliance and shuttling back and forth between the front and Kandahar where he would see Bin Ladin and meet with other mujahideen During this period Nashiri also led a plot to smuggle four Russian made antitank missiles into Saudi Arabia from Yemen in early 1998 and helped an embassy bombing operative obtain a Yemeni passport At some point Nashiri joined al Qaeda His cousin Jihad Mohammad Ali al Makki also known as Azzam was a suicide bomber for the Nairobi attack Nashiri traveled between Yemen and Afghanistan In late 1998 Nashiri proposed mounting an attack against a U S vessel Bin Ladin approved He directed Nashiri to start the planning and send operatives to Yemen and he later provided money Nashiri reported directly to Bin Ladin the only other person who according to Nashiri knew all the details of the operation When Nashiri had difficulty finding U S naval vessels to attack along the western coast of Yemen Bin Ladin reportedly instructed him to case the Port of Aden on the southern coast instead The eventual result was an attempted attack on the USS The Sullivans in January 2000 and the successful attack in October 2000 on the USS Cole Nashiri s success brought him instant status within al Qaeda He later was recognized as the chief of al Qaeda operations in and around the Arabian Peninsula While Nashiri continued to consult Bin Ladin on the planning of subsequent terrorist projects he retained discretion in selecting operatives and devising attacks In the two years between the Cole bombing and Nashiri s capture he would supervise several more proposed operations for al Qaeda The October 6 2002 bombing of the French tanker Limburg in the Gulf of Aden also was Nashiri s handiwork Although Bin Ladin urged Nashiri to continue plotting strikes against U S interests in the Persian Gulf Nashiri maintains that he actually delayed one of these projects because of security concerns 31Those concerns it seems were well placed as Nashiri s November 2002 capture in the United Arab Emirates finally ended his career as a terrorist THE PLANES OPERATION According to KSM he started to think about attacking the United States after Yousef returned to Pakistan following the 1993 World Trade Center bombing Like Yousef KSM reasoned he could best influence U S policy by targeting the country s economy KSM and Yousef reportedly brainstormed together about what drove the U S economy New York which KSM considered the economic capital of the United States therefore became the primary target For similar reasons California also became a target for KSM KSM claims that the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center taught him that bombs and explosives could be problematic and that he needed to graduate to a more novel form of attack He maintains that he and Yousef began thinking about using aircraft as weapons while working on the Manila air Bojinka plot and speculated about striking the World Trade Center and CIA headquarters as early as 1995 Certainly KSM was not alone in contemplating new kinds of terrorist operations A study reportedly conducted by Atef while he and Bin Ladin were still in Sudan concluded that traditional terrorist hijacking operations did not fit the needs of al Qaeda because such hijackings were used to negotiate the release of prisoners rather than to inflict mass casualties The study is said to have considered the feasibility of hijacking planes and blowing them up in flight paralleling the Bojinka concept Such a study if it actually existed yields significant insight into the thinking of al Qaeda s leaders 1 they rejected hijackings aimed at gaining the release of imprisoned comrades as too complex because al Qaeda had no friendly countries in which to land a plane and then negotiate 2 they considered the bombing of commercial flights in midair as carried out against Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie Scotland a promising means to inflict massive casualties and 3 they did not yet consider using hijacked aircraft as weapons against other targets KSM has insisted to his interrogators that he always contemplated hijacking and crashing large commercial aircraft Indeed KSM describes a grandiose original plan a total of ten aircraft to be hijacked nine of which would crash into targets on both coasts they included those eventually hit on September 11 plus CIA and FBI headquarters nuclear power plants and the tallest buildings in California and the state of Washington KSM himself was to land the tenth plane at a U S airport and after killing all adult male passengers on board and alerting the media deliver a speech excoriating U S support for Israel the Philippines and repressive governments in the Arab world Beyond KSM s rationalizations about targeting the U S economy this vision gives a better glimpse of his true ambitions This is theater a spectacle of destruction with KSM as the self cast star the superterrorist KSM concedes that this proposal received a lukewarm response from al Qaeda leaders skeptical of its scale and complexity Although Bin Ladin listened to KSM s proposal he was not convinced that it was practical As mentioned earlier Bin Ladin was receiving numerous ideas for potential operations KSM s proposal to attack U S targets with commercial airplanes was only one of many KSM presents himself as an entrepreneur seeking venture capital and people He simply wanted al Qaeda to supply the money and operatives needed for the attack while retaining his independence It is easy to question such a statement Money is one thing supplying a cadre of trained operatives willing to die is much more Thus although KSM contends he would have been just as likely to consider working with any comparable terrorist organization he gives no indication of what other groups he thought could supply such exceptional commodities KSM acknowledges formally joining al Qaeda in late 1998 or 1999 and states that soon afterward Bin Ladin also made the decision to support his proposal to attack the United States using commercial airplanes as weapons Though KSM speculates about how Bin Ladin came to share his preoccupation with attacking America Bin Ladin in fact had long been an opponent of the United States KSM thinks that Atef may have persuaded Bin Ladin to approve this specific proposal Atef s role in the entire operation is unquestionably very significant but tends to fade into the background in part because Atef himself is not available to describe it He was killed in November 2001 by an American air strike in Afghanistan Bin Ladin summoned KSM to Kandahar in March or April 1999 to tell him that al Qaeda would support his proposal The plot was now referred to within al Qaeda as the planes operation The Plan Evolves Bin Ladin reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar KSM s original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped but Bin Ladin considered the basic idea feasible Bin Ladin Atef and KSM developed an initial list of targets These included the White House the U S Capitol the Pentagon and the World Trade Center According to KSM Bin Ladin wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets Bin Ladin also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives Khalid al Mihdhar Nawaf al Hazmi Khallad and Abu Bara al Yemeni During the al Matar meetings Bin Ladin told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U S visas KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam Nashiri s cousin in carrying out the Nairobi bombing KSM had not met them His only guidance from Bin Ladin was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals born in Mecca Like the others in this initial group of selectees they were already experienced mujahideen They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995 By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999 they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions Khallad was another veteran mujahid like much of his family His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia where his father knew Bin Ladin Abdullah Azzam and Omar Abdel Rahman the Blind Sheikh Khallad departed for Afghanistan in 1994 at the age of 15 Three years later he lost his lower right leg in a battle with the Northern Alliance a battle in which one of his brothers died After this experience he pledged allegiance to Bin Ladin whom he had first met as a child in Jeddah and volunteered to become a suicide operative When Khallad applied for a U S visa however his application was denied Earlier in 1999 Bin Ladin had sent Khallad to Yemen to help Nashiri obtain explosives for the planned ship bombing and to obtain a visa to visit the United States so that he could participate in an operation there Khallad applied under another name using the cover story that he would be visiting a medical clinic to obtain a new prosthesis for his leg Another al Qaeda operative gave Khallad the name of a person living in the United States whom Khallad could use as a point of contact on a visa application Khallad contacted this individual to help him get an appointment at a U S clinic While Khallad was waiting for the letter from the clinic confirming the appointment however he was arrested by Yemeni authorities The arrest resulted from mistaken identity Khallad was driving the car of another conspirator in the ship bombing plot who was wanted by the Yemeni authorities Khallad was released sometime during the summer of 1999 after his father and Bin Ladin intervened on his behalf Khallad learned later that the al Qaeda leader apparently concerned that Khallad might reveal Nashiri s operation while under interrogation had contacted a Yemeni official to demand Khallad s release suggesting that Bin Ladin would not confront the Yemenis if they did not confront him This account has been corroborated by others Giving up on acquiring a U S visa and concerned that the United States might learn of his ties to al Qaeda Khallad returned to Afghanistan Travel issues thus played a part in al Qaeda s operational planning from the very start During the spring and summer of 1999 KSM realized that Khallad and Abu Bara both of whom were Yemenis would not be able to obtain U S visas as easily as Saudi operatives like Mihdhar and Hazmi Although Khallad had been unable to acquire a U S visa KSM still wanted him and Abu Bara as well as another Yemeni operative from Bin Ladin s security detail to participate in the planes operation Yet because individuals with Saudi passports could travel much more easily than Yemeni particularly to the United States there were fewer martyrdom opportunities for Yemenis To overcome this problem KSM decided to split the planes operation into two components The first part of the planes operation crashing hijacked aircraft into U S targets would remain as planned with Mihdhar and Hazmi playing key roles The second part however would now embrace the idea of using suicide operatives to blow up planes a refinement of KSM s old Manila air plot The operatives would hijack U S flagged commercial planes flying Pacific routes across East Asia and destroy them in midair possibly with shoe bombs instead of flying them into targets An alternate scenario apparently involved flying planes into U S targets in Japan Singapore or Korea This part of the operation has been confirmed by Khallad who said that they contemplated hijacking several planes probably originating in Thailand South Korea Hong Kong or Malaysia and using Yemenis who would not need pilot training because they would simply down the planes All the planes hijacked in the United States and East Asia were to be crashed or exploded at about the same time to maximize the attack s psychological impact Training and Deployment to Kuala Lumpur In the fall of 1999 the four operatives selected by Bin Ladin for the planes operation were chosen to attend an elite training course at al Qaeda s Mes Aynak camp in Afghanistan Bin Ladin personally selected the veteran fighters who received this training and several of them were destined for important operations One example is Ibrahim al Thawar or Nibras who would participate in the October 12 2000 suicide attack on the USS Cole According to KSM this training was not given specifically in preparation for the planes operation or any other particular al Qaeda venture Although KSM claims not to have been involved with the training or to have met with the future 9 11 hijackers at Mes Aynak he says he did visit the camp while traveling from Kandahar to Kabul with Bin Ladin and others The Mes Aynak training camp was located in an abandoned Russian copper mine near Kabul The camp opened in 1999 after the United States had destroyed the training camp near Khowst with cruise missiles in August 1998 and before theTaliban granted al Qaeda permission to open the al Faruq camp in Kandahar Thus for a brief period in 1999 Mes Aynak was the only al Qaeda camp operating in Afghanistan It offered a full range of instruction including an advanced commando course taught by senior al Qaeda member Sayf al Adl Bin Ladin paid particular attention to the 1999 training session When Salah al Din the trainer for the session complained about the number of trainees and said that no more than 20 could be handled at once Bin Ladin insisted that everyone he had selected receive the training The special training session at Mes Aynak was rigorous and spared no expense The course focused on physical fitness firearms close quarters combat shooting from a motorcycle and night operations Although the subjects taught differed little from those offered at other camps the course placed extraordinary physical and mental demands on its participants who received the best food and other amenities to enhance their strength and morale Upon completing the advanced training at Mes Aynak Hazmi Khallad and Abu Bara went to Karachi Pakistan There KSM instructed them on Western culture and travel Much of his activity in mid 1999 had revolved around the collection of training and informational materials for the participants in the planes operation For instance he collected Western aviation magazines telephone directories for American cities such as San Diego and Long Beach California brochures for schools and airline timetables and he conducted Internet searches on U S flight schools He also purchased flight simulator software and a few movies depicting hijackings To house his students KSM rented a safehouse in Karachi with money provided by Bin Ladin In early December 1999 Khallad and Abu Bara arrived in Karachi Hazmi joined them there a few days later On his way to Karachi Hazmi spent a night in Quetta at a safehouse where according to KSM an Egyptian named Mohamed Atta simultaneously stayed on his way to Afghanistan for jihad training Mihdhar did not attend the training in Karachi with the others KSM says that he never met with Mihdhar in 1999 but assumed that Bin Ladin and Atef had briefed Mihdhar on the planes operation and had excused him from the Karachi training The course in Karachi apparently lasted about one or two weeks According to KSM he taught the three operatives basic English words and phrases He showed them how to read phone books interpret airline timetables use the Internet use code words in communications make travel reservations and rent an apartment Khallad adds that the training involved using flight simulator computer games viewing movies that featured hijackings and reading flight schedules to determine which flights would be in the air at the same time in different parts of the world They used the game software to increase their familiarity with aircraft models and functions and to highlight gaps in cabin security While in Karachi they also discussed how to case flights in Southeast Asia KSM told them to watch the cabin doors at takeoff and landing to observe whether the captain went to the lavatory during the flight and to note whether the flight attendants brought food into the cockpit KSM Khallad and Hazmi also visited travel agencies to learn the visa requirements for Asian countries The four trainees traveled to Kuala Lumpur Khallad Abu Bara and Hazmi came from Karachi Mihdhar traveled from Yemen As discussed in chapter 6 U S intelligence would analyze communications associated with Mihdhar whom they identified during this travel and Hazmi whom they could have identified but did not According to KSM the four operatives were aware that they had volunteered for a suicide operation either in the United States or in Asia With different roles they had different tasks Hazmi and Mihdhar were sent to Kuala Lumpur before proceeding to their final destination the United States According to KSM they were to use Yemeni documents to fly to Malaysia then proceed to the United States using their Saudi passports to conceal their prior travels to and from Pakistan KSM had doctored Hazmi s Saudi passport so it would appear as if Hazmi had traveled to Kuala Lumpur from Saudi Arabia via Dubai Khallad and Abu Bara went to Kuala Lumpur to study airport security and conduct casing flights According to Khallad he and Abu Bara departed for Malaysia in mid December 1999 Hazmi joined them about ten days later after briefly returning to Afghanistan to attend to some passport issues Khallad had originally scheduled his trip in order to receive a new prosthesis at a Kuala Lumpur clinic called Endolite and Bin Ladin suggested that he use the opportunity to case flights as well According to Khallad Malaysia was an ideal destination because its government did not require citizens of Saudi Arabia or other Gulf states to have a visa Malaysian security was reputed to be lax when it came to Islamist jihadists Also other mujahideen wounded in combat had reportedly received treatment at the Endolite clinic and successfully concealed the origins of their injuries Khallad said he got the money for the prosthesis from his father Bin Ladin and another al Qaeda colleague According to Khallad when he and Abu Bara arrived in Kuala Lumpur they contacted Hambali to let him know where they were staying since he was to be kept informed of al Qaeda activities in Southeast Asia Hambali picked up Khallad and Abu Bara and brought them to his home enlisting the help of a colleague who spoke better Arabic Hambali then took them to the clinic On December 31 Khallad flew from Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok the next day he flew to Hong Kong aboard a U S airliner He flew in first class which he realized was a mistake because this seating assignment on that flight did not afford him a view of the cockpit He claims to have done what he could to case the flight testing security by carrying a box cutter in his toiletries kit onto the flight to Hong Kong Khallad returned to Bangkok the following day At the airport the security officials searched his carry on bag and even opened the toiletries kit but just glanced at the contents and let him pass On this flight Khallad waited until most of the first class passengers were dozing then got up and removed the kit from his carry on None of the flight attendants took notice After completing his casing mission Khallad returned to Kuala Lumpur Hazmi arrived in Kuala Lumpur soon thereafter and may even have stayed briefly with Khallad and Abu Bara at Endolite Mihdhar arrived on January 5 probably one day after Hazmi All four operatives stayed at the apartment of Yazid Sufaat the Malaysian JI member who made his home available at Hambali s request According to Khallad he and Hazmi spoke about the possibility of hijacking planes and crashing them or holding passengers as hostages but only speculatively Khallad admits being aware at the time that Hazmi and Mihdhar were involved in an operation involving planes in the United States but denies knowing details of the plan While in Kuala Lumpur Khallad wanted to go to Singapore to meet Nibras and Fahd al Quso two of the operatives in Nashiri s ship bombing operation An attempt to execute that plan by attacking the USS The Sullivans had failed just a few days earlier Nibras and Quso were bringing Khallad money from Yemen but were stopped in Bangkok because they lacked visas to continue on to Singapore Also unable to enter Singapore Khallad moved the meeting to Bangkok Hazmi and Mihdhar decided to go there as well reportedly because they thought it would enhance their cover as tourists to have passport stamps from a popular tourist destination such as Thailand With Hambali s help the three obtained tickets for a flight to Bangkok and left Kuala Lumpur together Abu Bara did not have a visa permitting him to return to Pakistan so he traveled to Yemen instead In Bangkok Khallad took Hazmi and Mihdhar to one hotel then went to another hotel for his meeting on the maritime attack plan Hazmi and Mihdhar soon moved to that same hotel but Khallad insists that the two sets of operatives never met with each other or anyone else After conferring with the ship bombing operatives Khallad returned to Karachi and then to Kandahar where he reported on his casing mission to Bin Ladin Bin Ladin canceled the East Asia part of the planes operation in the spring of 2000 He evidently decided it would be too difficult to coordinate this attack with the operation in the United States As for Hazmi and Mihdhar they had left Bangkok a few days before Khallad and arrived in Los Angeles on January 15 2000 Meanwhile the next group of al Qaeda operatives destined for the planes operation had just surfaced in Afghanistan As Hazmi and Mihdhar were deploying from Asia to the United States al Qaeda s leadership was recruiting and training four Western educated men who had recently arrived in Kandahar Though they hailed from four different countries Egypt the United Arab Emirates Lebanon and Yemen they had formed a close knit group as students in Hamburg Germany The new recruits had come to Afghanistan aspiring to wage jihad in Chechnya But al Qaeda quickly recognized their potential and enlisted them in its anti U S jihad THE HAMBURG CONTINGENT Although Bin Ladin Atef and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative The Hamburg group shared the anti U S fervor of the other candidates for the operation but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany Not surprisingly Mohamed Atta Ramzi Binalshibh Marwan al Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9 11 conspiracy Mohamed Atta Mohamed Atta was born on September 1 1968 in Kafr el Sheikh Egypt to a middle class family headed by his father an attorney After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990 Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years In the fall of 1991 he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there at least initially After completing a course in German Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992 He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then in the fall of 1992 moved to Hamburg to live with his host family After enrolling at the University of Hamburg he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg Harburg where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999 He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies at least in comparison to his jihadist friends and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan In school Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant with an excellent command of the German language When Atta arrived in Germany he appeared religious but not fanatically so This would change especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced According to Binalshibh as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg In the fall of 1997 he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians Atta proved a poor bridge however because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality But among those who shared his beliefs Atta stood out as a decisionmaker Atta s friends during this period remember him as charismatic intelligent and persuasive albeit intolerant of dissent In his interactions with other students Atta voiced virulently anti Semitic and anti American opinions ranging from condemnations of what he described as a global Jewish movement centered in New York City that supposedly controlled the financial world and the media to polemics against governments of the Arab world To him Saddam Hussein was an American stooge set up to give Washington an excuse to intervene in the Middle East Within his circle Atta advocated violent jihad He reportedly asked one individual close to the group if he was ready to fight for his belief and dismissed him as too weak for jihad when the person declined On a visit home to Egypt in 1998 Atta met one of his college friends According to this friend Atta had changed a great deal had grown a beard and had obviously adopted fundamentalism by that time Ramzi Binalshibh Ramzi Binalshibh was born on May 1 1972 in Ghayl Bawazir Yemen There does not seem to be anything remarkable about his family or early background A friend who knew Binalshibh in Yemen remembers him as religious but not too religious From 1987 to 1995 Binalshibh worked as a clerk for the International Bank of Yemen He first attempted to leave Yemen in 1995 when he applied for a U S visa After his application was rejected he went to Germany and applied for asylum under the name Ramzi Omar claiming to be a Sudanese citizen seeking asylum While his asylum petition was pending Binalshibh lived in Hamburg and associated with individuals from several mosques there In 1997 after his asylum application was denied Binalshibh went home to Yemen but returned to Germany shortly thereafter under his true name this time registering as a student in Hamburg Binalshibh continually had academic problems failing tests and cutting classes he was expelled from one school in September 1998 According to Binalshibh he and Atta first met at a mosque in Hamburg in 1995 The two men became close friends and became identified with their shared extremist outlook Like Atta by the late 1990s Binalshibh was decrying what he perceived to be a Jewish world conspiracy He proclaimed that the highest duty of every Muslim was to pursue jihad and that the highest honor was to die during the jihad Despite his rhetoric however Binalshibh presented a more amiable figure than the austere Atta and was known within the community as being sociable extroverted polite and adventuresome In 1998 Binalshibh and Atta began sharing an apartment in the Harburg section of Hamburg together with a young student from the United Arab Emirates named Marwan al Shehhi Marwan al Shehhi Marwan al Shehhi was born on May 9 1978 in Ras al Khaimah the United Arab Emirates His father who died in 1997 was a prayer leader at the local mosque After graduating from high school in 1995 Shehhi joined the Emirati military and received half a year of basic training before gaining admission to a military scholarship program that would fund his continued study in Germany Shehhi first entered Germany in April 1996 After sharing an apartment in Bonn for two months with three other scholarship students Shehhi moved in with a German family with whom he resided for several months before moving into his own apartment During this period he came across as very religious praying five times a day Friends also remember him as convivial and a regular guy wearing Western clothes and occasionally renting cars for trips to Berlin France and the Netherlands As a student Shehhi was less than a success Upon completing a course in German he enrolled at the University of Bonn in a program for technical mathematical and scientific studies In June 1997 he requested a leave from his studies citing the need to attend to unspecified problems in his home country Although the university denied his request Shehhi left anyway and consequently was compelled to repeat the first semester of his studies In addition to having academic difficulties at this time Shehhi appeared to become more extreme in the practice of his faith for example he specifically avoided restaurants that cooked with or served alcohol In late 1997 he applied for permission to complete his course work in Hamburg a request apparently motivated by his desire to join Atta and Binalshibh Just how and when the three of them first met remains unclear although they seemed to know each other already when Shehhi relocated to Hamburg in early 1998 Atta and Binalshibh moved into his apartment in April The transfer to Hamburg did not help Shehhi s academic progress he was directed by the scholarship program administrators at the Emirati embassy to repeat his second semester starting in August 1998 but back in Bonn Shehhi initially flouted this directive however and did not reenroll at the University of Bonn until the following January barely passing his course there By the end of July 1999 he had returned to Hamburg applying to study shipbuilding at the Technical University and more significantly residing once again with Atta and Binalshibh in an apartment at 54 Marienstrasse After Shehhi moved in with Atta and Binalshibh his evolution toward Islamic fundamentalism became more pronounced A fellow Emirati student who came to Hamburg to visit Shehhi noticed he no longer lived as comfortably as before Shehhi now occupied an old apartment with a roommate had no television and wore inexpensive clothes When asked why he was living so frugally Shehhi responded that he was living the way the Prophet had lived Similarly when someone asked why he and Atta never laughed Shehhi retorted How can you laugh when people are dying in Palestine Ziad Jarrah Born on May 11 1975 in Mazraa Lebanon Ziad Jarrah came from an affluent family and attended private Christian schools Like Atta Binalshibh and Shehhi Jarrah aspired to pursue higher education in Germany In April 1996 he and a cousin enrolled at a junior college in Greifswald in northeastern Germany There Jarrah met and became intimate with Aysel Senguen the daughter of Turkish immigrants who was preparing to study dentistry Even with the benefit of hindsight Jarrah hardly seems a likely candidate for becoming an Islamic extremist Far from displaying radical beliefs when he first moved to Germany he arrived with a reputation for knowing where to find the best discos and beaches in Beirut and in Greifswald was known to enjoy student parties and drinking beer Although he continued to share an apartment in Greifswald with his cousin Jarrah was mostly at Senguen s apartment Witnesses interviewed by German authorities after 9 11 however recall that Jarrah started showing signs of radicalization as early as the end of 1996 After returning from a trip home to Lebanon Jarrah started living more strictly according to the Koran He read brochures in Arabic about jihad held forth to friends on the subject of holy war and professed disaffection with his previous life and a desire not to leave the world in a natural way In September 1997 Jarrah abruptly switched his intended course of study from dentistry to aircraft engineering at the Technical University of Hamburg Harburg His motivation for this decision remains unclear The rationale he expressed to Senguen that he had been interested in aviation since playing with toy airplanes as a child rings somewhat hollow In any event Jarrah appears already to have had Hamburg contacts by this time some of whom may have played a role in steering him toward Islamic extremism Following his move to Hamburg that fall he began visiting Senguen in Greifswald on weekends until she moved to the German city of Bochum one year later to enroll in dental school Around the same time he began speaking increasingly about religion and his visits to Senguen became less and less frequent He began criticizing her for not being religious enough and for dressing too provocatively He grew a full beard and started praying regularly He refused to introduce her to his Hamburg friends because he told her they were religious Muslims and her refusal to become more observant embarrassed him At some point in 1999 Jarrah told Senguen that he was planning to wage a jihad because there was no greater honor than to die for Allah Although Jarrah s transformation generated numerous quarrels their breakups invariably were followed by reconciliation Forming a Cell In Hamburg Jarrah had a succession of living accommodations but he apparently never resided with his future co conspirators It is not clear how and when he became part of Atta s circle He became particularly friendly with Binalshibh after meeting him at the Quds mosque in Hamburg which Jarrah began attending regularly in late 1997 The worshippers at this mosque featured an outspoken flamboyant Islamist named Mohammed Haydar Zammar A well known figure in the Muslim community and to German and U S intelligence agencies by the late 1990s Zammar had fought in Afghanistan and relished any opportunity to extol the virtues of violent jihad Indeed a witness has reported hearing Zammar press Binalshibh to fulfill his duty to wage jihad Moreover after 9 11 Zammar reportedly took credit for influencing not just Binalshibh but the rest of the Hamburg group In 1998 Zammar encouraged them to participate in jihad and even convinced them to go to Afghanistan Owing to Zammar s persuasion or some other source of inspiration Atta Binalshibh Shehhi and Jarrah eventually prepared themselves to translate their extremist beliefs into action By late 1999 they were ready to abandon their student lives in Germany in favor of violent jihad This final stage in their evolution toward embracing Islamist extremism did not entirely escape the notice of the people around them The foursome became core members of a group of radical Muslims often hosting sessions at their Marienstrasse apartment that involved extremely anti American discussions Meeting three to four times a week the group became something of a sect whose members according to one participant in the meetings tended to deal only with each other Atta s rent checks for the apartment provide evidence of the importance that the apartment assumed as a center for the group as he would write on them the notation Dar el Ansar or house of the followers In addition to Atta Binalshibh Shehhi and Jarrah the group included other extremists some of whom also would attend al Qaeda training camps and in some instances would help the 9 11 hijackers as they executed the plot Said Bahaji son of a Moroccan immigrant was the only German citizen in the group Educated in Morocco Bahaji returned to Germany to study electrical engineering at the Technical University of Hamburg Harburg He spent five months in the German army before obtaining a medical discharge and lived with Atta and Binalshibh at 54 Marienstrasse for eight months between November 1998 and July 1999 Described as an insecure follower with no personality and with limited knowledge of Islam Bahaji nonetheless professed his readiness to engage in violence Atta and Binalshibh used Bahaji s computer for Internet research as evidenced by documents and diskettes seized by German authorities after 9 11 Zakariya Essabar a Moroccan citizen moved to Germany in February 1997 and to Hamburg in 1998 where he studied medical technology Soon after moving to Hamburg Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly probably in 1999 and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious grow a beard and compel his wife to convert to Islam Essabar s parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle Shortly before the 9 11 attacks he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership Mounir el Motassadeq another Moroccan came to Germany in 1993 moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it One of Motassadeq s roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a good man and organizing film sessions that included speeches by Bin Ladin Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group s trip to Afghanistan in late 1999 Abdelghani Mzoudi also a Moroccan arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993 after completing university courses in physics and chemistry Mzoudi studied in Dortmund Bochum and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995 Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg In April 1996 Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta s will During the course of 1999 Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time Witnesses have attested however that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States In short they fit the bill for Bin Ladin Atef and KSM Going to Afghanistan The available evidence indicates that in 1999 Atta Binalshibh Shehhi and Jarrah decided to fight in Chechnya against the Russians According to Binalshibh a chance meeting on a train in Germany caused the group to travel to Afghanistan instead An individual named Khalid al Masri approached Binalshibh and Shehhi because they were Arabs with beards Binalshibh thinks and struck up a conversation about jihad in Chechnya When they later called Masri and expressed interest in going to Chechnya he told them to contact Abu Musab in Duisburg Germany Abu Musab turned out to be Mohamedou Ould Slahi a significant al Qaeda operative who even then was well known to U S and German intelligence though neither government apparently knew he was operating in Germany in late 1999 When telephoned by Binalshibh and Shehhi Slahi reportedly invited these promising recruits to come see him in Duisburg Binalshibh Shehhi and Jarrah made the trip When they arrived Slahi explained that it was difficult to get to Chechnya at that time because many travelers were being detained in Georgia He recommended they go to Afghanistan instead where they could train for jihad before traveling onward to Chechnya Slahi instructed them to obtain Pakistani visas and then return to him for further directions on how to reach Afghanistan Although Atta did not attend the meeting he joined in the plan with the other three After obtaining the necessary visas they received Slahi s final instructions on how to travel to Karachi and then Quetta where they were to contact someone named Umar al Masri at the Taliban office Following Slahi s advice Atta and Jarrah left Hamburg during the last week of November 1999 bound for Karachi Shehhi left for Afghanistan around the same time Binalshibh about two weeks later Binalshibh remembers that when he arrived at the Taliban office in Quetta there was no one named Umar al Masri The name apparently was simply a code a group of Afghans from the office promptly escorted him to Kandahar There Binalshibh rejoined Atta and Jarrah who said they already had pledged loyalty to Bin Ladin and urged him to do the same They also informed him that Shehhi had pledged as well and had already left for the United Arab Emirates to prepare for the mission Binalshibh soon met privately with Bin Ladin accepted the al Qaeda leader s invitation to work under him and added his own pledge to those of his Hamburg colleagues By this time Binalshibh claims he assumed he was volunteering for a martyrdom operation Atta Jarrah and Binalshibh then met with Atef who told them they were about to undertake a highly secret mission As Binalshibh tells it Atef instructed the three to return to Germany and enroll in flight training Atta whom Bin Ladin chose to lead the group met with Bin Ladin several times to receive additional instructions including a preliminary list of approved targets the World Trade Center the Pentagon and the U S Capitol The new recruits also learned that an individual named Rabia al Makki Nawaf al Hazmi would be part of the operation In retrospect the speed with which Atta Shehhi Jarrah and Binalshibh became core members of the 9 11 plot with Atta designated its operational leader is remarkable They had not yet met with KSM when all this occurred It is clear then that Bin Ladin and Atef were very much in charge of the operation That these candidates were selected so quickly before comprehensive testing in the training camps or in operations demonstrates that Bin Ladin and Atef probably already understood the deficiencies of their initial team Hazmi and Mihdhar The new recruits from Germany possessed an ideal combination of technical skill and knowledge that the original 9 11 operatives veteran fighters though they were lacked Bin Ladin and Atef wasted no time in assigning the Hamburg group to the most ambitious operation yet planned by al Qaeda Bin Ladin and Atef also plainly judged that Atta was best suited to be the tactical commander of the operation Such a quick and critical judgment invites speculation about whether they had already taken Atta s measure at some earlier meeting To be sure some gaps do appear in the record of Atta s known whereabouts during the preceding years One such gap is February March 1998 a period for which there is no evidence of his presence in Germany and when he conceivably could have been in Afghanistan Yet to date neither KSM Binalshibh nor any other al Qaeda figure interrogated about the 9 11 plot has claimed that Atta or any other member of the Hamburg group traveled to Afghanistan before the trip in late 1999 While the four core Hamburg cell members were in Afghanistan their associates back in Hamburg handled their affairs so that their trip could be kept secret Motassadeq appears to have done the most He terminated Shehhi s apartment lease telling the landlord that Shehhi had returned to the UAE for family reasons and used a power of attorney to pay bills from Shehhi s bank account Motassadeq also assisted Jarrah offering to look after Aysel Senguen in Jarrah s absence Said Bahaji attended to similar routine matters for Atta and Binalshibh thereby helping them remain abroad without drawing attention to their absence Preparing for the Operation In early 2000 Atta Jarrah and Binalshibh returned to Hamburg Jarrah arrived first on January 31 2000 97 According to Binalshibh he and Atta left Kandahar together and proceeded first to Karachi where they met KSM and were instructed by him on security and on living in the United States Shehhi apparently had already met with KSM before returning to the UAE Atta returned to Hamburg in late February and Binalshibh arrived shortly thereafter Shehhi s travels took him to the UAE where he acquired a new passport and a U S visa Saudi Arabia Bahrain and one or more other destinations Shehhi also returned to Germany possibly sometime in March After leaving Afghanistan the hijackers made clear efforts to avoid appearing radical Once back in Hamburg they distanced themselves from conspicuous extremists like Zammar whom they knew attracted unwanted attention from the authorities They also changed their appearance and behavior Atta wore Western clothing shaved his beard and no longer attended extremist mosques Jarrah also no longer wore a full beard and according to Senguen acted much more the way he had when she first met him And when Shehhi while still in the UAE in January 2000 held a belated wedding celebration he actually had been married in 1999 a friend of his was surprised to see that he had shaved off his beard and was acting like his old self again But Jarrah s apparent efforts to appear less radical did not completely conceal his transformation from his Lebanese family which grew increasingly concerned about his fanaticism Soon after Jarrah returned to Germany his father asked Jarrah s cousin a close companion from boyhood to intercede The cousin s ensuing effort to persuade Jarrah to depart from the path he was taking proved unavailing 101Yet Jarrah clearly differed from the other hijackers in that he maintained much closer contact with his family and continued his intimate relationship with Senguen These ties may well have caused him to harbor some doubts about going through with the plot even as late as the summer of 2001 as discussed in chapter 7 After leaving Afghanistan the four began researching flight schools and aviation training In early January 2000 Ali Abdul Aziz Ali a nephew of KSM living in the UAE who would become an important facilitator in the plot used Shehhi s credit card to order a Boeing 747 400 flight simulator program and a Boeing 767 flight deck video together with attendant literature Ali had all these items shipped to his employer s address Jarrah soon decided that the schools in Germany were not acceptable and that he would have to learn to fly in the United States Binalshibh also researched flight schools in Europe and in the Netherlands he met a flight school director who recommended flight schools in the United States because they were less expensive and required shorter training periods In March 2000 Atta emailed 31 different U S flight schools on behalf of a small group of men from various Arab countries studying in Germany who while lacking prior training were interested in learning to fly in the United States Atta requested information about the cost of the training potential financing and accommodations Before seeking visas to enter the United States Atta Shehhi and Jarrah obtained new passports each claiming that his old passport had been lost Presumably they were concerned that the Pakistani visas in their old passports would raise suspicions about possible travel to Afghanistan Shehhi obtained his visa on January 18 2000 Atta on May 18 and Jarrah on May 25 Binalshibh s visa request was rejected however as were his three subsequent applications 105 Binalshibh proved unable to obtain a visa a victim of the generalized suspicion that visa applicants from Yemen especially young men applying in another country Binalshibh first applied in Berlin might join the ranks of undocumented aliens seeking work in the United States Before 9 11 security concerns were not a major factor in visa issuance unless the applicant already was on a terrorist watchlist and none of these four men was Concerns that Binalshibh intended to immigrate to the United States doomed his chances to participate firsthand in the 9 11 attacks Although Binalshibh had to remain behind he would provide critical assistance from abroad to his co conspirators Once again the need for travel documents dictated al Qaeda s plans Travel It should by now be apparent how significant travel was in the planning undertaken by a terrorist organization as far flung as al Qaeda The story of the plot includes references to dozens of international trips Operations required travel as did basic communications and the movement of money Where electronic communications were regarded as insecure al Qaeda relied even more heavily on couriers KSM and Abu Zubaydah each played key roles in facilitating travel for al Qaeda operatives In addition al Qaeda had an office of passports and host country issues under its security committee The office was located at the Kandahar airport and was managed by Atef The committee altered papers including passports visas and identification cards Moreover certain al Qaeda members were charged with organizing passport collection schemes to keep the pipeline of fraudulent documents flowing To this end al Qaeda required jihadists to turn in their passports before going to the front lines in Afghanistan If they were killed their passports were recycled for use The operational mission training course taught operatives how to forge documents Certain passport alteration methods which included substituting photos and erasing and adding travel cachets were also taught Manuals demonstrating the technique for cleaning visas were reportedly circulated among operatives Mohamed Atta and Zakariya Essabar were reported to have been trained in passport alteration The purpose of all this training was twofold to develop an institutional capacity for document forgery and to enable operatives to make necessary adjustments in the field It was well known for example that if a Saudi traveled to Afghanistan via Pakistan then on his return to Saudi Arabia his passport bearing a Pakistani stamp would be confiscated So operatives either erased the Pakistani visas from their passports or traveled through Iran which did not stamp visas directly into passports A MONEY TRAIL Bin Ladin and his aides did not need a very large sum to finance their planned attack on America The 9 11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between 400 000 and 500 000 to plan and conduct their attack Consistent with the importance of the project al Qaeda funded the plotters KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States train and live The plotters tradecraft was not especially sophisticated but it was good enough They moved stored and spent their money in ordinary ways easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time The origin of the funds remains unknown although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9 11 General Financing As we explained in chapter 2 Bin Ladin did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan Instead al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund raising network developed over time The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about 30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9 11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations For many years the United States thought Bin Ladin financed al Qaeda s expenses through a vast personal inheritance Bin Ladin purportedly inherited approximately 300 million when his father died and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda In early 2000 the U S government discovered a different reality roughly from 1970 through 1994 Bin Ladin received about 1 million per year a significant sum to be sure but not a 300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad Then as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s the Bin Ladin family was forced to find a buyer for Usama s share of the family company in 1994 The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale This action had the effect of divesting Bin Ladin of what otherwise might indeed have been a large fortune Nor were Bin Ladin s assets in Sudan a source of money for al Qaeda When Bin Ladin lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996 he owned a number of businesses and other assets These could not have provided significant income as most were small or not economically viable When Bin Ladin left in 1996 it appears that the Sudanese government expropriated all his assets he left Sudan with practically nothing When Bin Ladin arrived in Afghanistan he relied on the Taliban until he was able to reinvigorate his fund raising efforts by drawing on ties to wealthy Saudi individuals that he had established during the Afghan war in the 1980s Al Qaeda appears to have relied on a core group of financial facilitators who raised money from a variety of donors and other fund raisers primarily in the Gulf countries and particularly in Saudi Arabia Some individual donors surely knew and others did not the ultimate destination of their donations Al Qaeda and its friends took advantage of Islam s strong calls for charitable giving zakat These financial facilitators also appeared to rely heavily on certain imams at mosques who were willing to divert zakat donations to al Qaeda s cause Al Qaeda also collected money from employees of corrupt charities It took two approaches to using charities for fund raising One was to rely on al Qaeda sympathizers in specific foreign branch offices of large international charities particularly those with lax external oversight and ineffective internal controls such as the Saudi based al Haramain Islamic Foundation Smaller charities in various parts of the globe were funded by these large Gulf charities and had employees who would siphon the money to al Qaeda In addition entire charities such as the al Wafa organization may have wittingly participated in funneling money to al Qaeda In those cases al Qaeda operatives controlled the entire organization including access to bank accounts Charities were a source of money and also provided significant cover which enabled operatives to travel undetected under the guise of working for a humanitarian organization It does not appear that any government other than the Taliban financially supported al Qaeda before 9 11 although some governments may have contained al Qaeda sympathizers who turned a blind eye to al Qaeda s fundraising activities Saudi Arabia has long been considered the primary source of al Qaeda funding but we have found no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organization This conclusion does not exclude the likelihood that charities with significant Saudi government sponsorship diverted funds to al Qaeda 122 Still al Qaeda found fertile fund raising ground in Saudi Arabia where extreme religious views are common and charitable giving was both essential to the culture and subject to very limited oversight Al Qaeda also sought money from wealthy donors in other Gulf states Al Qaeda frequently moved the money it raised by hawala an informal and ancient trust based system for transferring funds In some ways al Qaeda had no choice after its move to Afghanistan in 1996 first the banking system there was antiquated and undependable and second formal banking was risky due to the scrutiny that al Qaeda received after the August 1998 East Africa embassy bombings including UN resolutions against it and the Taliban Bin Ladin relied on the established hawala networks operating in Pakistan in Dubai and throughout the Middle East to transfer funds efficiently Hawaladars associated with al Qaeda may have used banks to move and store money as did various al Qaeda fund raisers and operatives outside of Afghanistan but there is little evidence that Bin Ladin or core al Qaeda members used banks while in Afghanistan Before 9 11 al Qaeda spent funds as quickly as it received them Actual terrorist operations represented a relatively small part of al Qaeda s estimated 30 million annual operating budget Al Qaeda funded salaries for jihadists training camps airfields vehicles arms and the development of training manuals Bin Ladin provided approximately 10 20 million per year to the Taliban in return for safe haven Bin Ladin also may have used money to create alliances with other terrorist organizations although it is unlikely that al Qaeda was funding an overall jihad program Rather Bin Ladin selectively provided startup funds to new groups or money for specific terrorist operations Al Qaeda has been alleged to have used a variety of illegitimate means particularly drug trafficking and conflict diamonds to finance itself While the drug trade was a source of income for the Taliban it did not serve the same purpose for al Qaeda and there is no reliable evidence that Bin Ladin was involved in or made his money through drug trafficking Similarly we have seen no persuasive evidence that al Qaeda funded itself by trading in African conflict diamonds 129 There also have been claims that al Qaeda financed itself through manipulation of the stock market based on its advance knowledge of the 9 11 attacks Exhaustive investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission FBI and other agencies have uncovered no evidence that anyone with advance knowledge of the attacks profited through securities transactions To date the U S government has not been able to determine the origin of the money used for the 9 11 attacks Ultimately the question is of little practical significance Al Qaeda had many avenues of funding If a particular funding source had dried up al Qaeda could have easily tapped a different source or diverted funds from another project to fund an operation that cost 400 000 500 000 over nearly two years The Funding of the 9 11 Plot As noted above the 9 11 plotters spent somewhere between 400 000 and 500 000 to plan and conduct their attack The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance Similarly we have seen no evidence that any foreign government or foreign government official supplied any funding We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members Atta Shehhi Jarrah and Binalshibh received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999 It appears they supported themselves KSM Binalshibh and another plot facilitator Mustafa al Hawsawi each received money in some cases perhaps as much as 10 000 to perform their roles in the plot After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9 11 conspiracy al Qaeda began giving them money Our knowledge of the funding during this period before the operatives entered the United States remains murky According to KSM the Hamburg cell members each received 5 000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7 Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States al Qaeda s leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate approve and supervise the planning and direction of the operation communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them a personnel system that could recruit candidates vet them indoctrinate them and give them necessary training an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses the ability to move people and the ability to raise and move the necessary money The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how by the spring and summer of 2000 al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements By late May 2000 two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive
