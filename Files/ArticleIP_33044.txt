 Grade Expectations Next month college students around the country will return to campus hoping among other things to achieve high grades Of course high is a moving target I remember when C meant average today whenever I turn in my students final grades the dean s office instructs me to treat C as the minimum acceptable grade This side of Lake Wobegon we call that grade inflation It s a clich that when grades are inflated they convey less information The clich is only half true On the one hand inflated grades fail to distinguish between the merely above average and the truly superior But on the other hand inflated grades do a super job of distinguishing among fine gradations of weakness When the average grade is B the strong students are all lumped together with A s while the weak ones are sorted into C s D s and F s That s still a net loss in valuable information because employers care more about making distinctions at the top than about making distinctions at the bottom Therefore college degrees which derive their value from the information they carry become less valuable on average Here s a quick example Mary the A student is worth 40 000 to an employer and Jane the B student is worth 30 000 if grade inflation makes it impossible to tell them apart you might expect an employer to offer them 35 000 apiece But the inability to distinguish Mary from Jane makes it harder to assign them to appropriate tasks That lowers their average value to say 32 000 which is what they both get paid Jane wins and Mary loses but Mary s loss exceeds Jane s gain Does that mean that above average students should object to grade inflation Not necessarily because students do not live by starting salaries alone There are advantages to living with less competitive pressure and those advantages could more than offset the financial losses Besides students don t bear the full burden of those financial losses As degrees become less valuable colleges must cut tuition or lose enrollments Or more precisely they must sacrifice some growth in tuition or in enrollments both of which have been rising for reasons that have nothing to do with grade inflation A college that can distinguish itself from the pack by maintaining high standards should be able to reap substantial rewards in the marketplace because its degrees are worth more If colleges pay the price for grade inflation why do they allow it Partly it s because colleges don t assign grades Professors assign grades and professors face perverse incentives Being human they tend to take a special interest in their own students and are therefore tempted to give those students a boost at the expense of the anonymous strangers who signed up for someone else s class Besides easy graders are more popular on campus The costs of leniency measured in lost reputation are spread over the entire school while the benefits are concentrated in the professor s own classroom Therefore the professor is biased toward leniency The problem then is in the gap between the professor s interests and the college s Any solution must involve narrowing that gap That s where tenure comes in An untenured professor is like a corporate bondholder as long as the institution stays above water in the short run he s happy A tenured professor is like a corporate stockholder he has a permanent stake in the fortunes of the institution Professors should have job security for the same reason Alan Greenspan should have job security It instills a healthy respect for the long run According to a widespread belief grade inflation took off during the Vietnam War era in response to the idiosyncrasies of the Selective Service System According to an equally widespread belief the late 60s and early 70s were also a time when tenure became far more elusive Professors began moving from one school to another every few years with little reason to care about the reputational damage they left in their wakes So perhaps the war was irrelevant grade inflation was the inevitable consequence of upheaval in the tenure system But tenure is at best a partial solution to the incentive problem because even a tenured professor shares only a fraction of his institution s successes and failures Let me propose some improvements First college transcripts could show each professor s overall grade distribution allowing employers to interpret each individual grade in context Then instead of damaging his colleagues credibility the easy grader would damage only his own Second the dean s office could assign each professor a grade budget consisting of a certain number of A s B s etc Once you ve awarded say 10 A s you can t award any more till next year To cover extraordinary circumstances I d be willing to allow horse trading among professors three A s for five B s say and perhaps occasional borrowing against next year s budget A grade budget is not exactly the same thing as a mandatory curve because it would allow professors the flexibility to give more high grades in one class if they re willing to give fewer in another Still every now and then a professor would have four genuine A students and only three A s to give out One of those students would suffer unjustly But the A students are precisely the ones who suffer unjustly from grade inflation The question is not how to eliminate injustice which is as always impossible but how to minimize it For the individual professor a grade budget is a stifling constraint That doesn t make it a bad thing Economic theory tells us that when everyone is polluting a communal stream everyone can benefit from enforced moderation It always hurts to be constrained but sometimes it s worth it if your neighbors are constrained too With grade budgets professors would be forced to give fewer A s but the A s they gave would be more valuable If grade budgets are such a good idea why don t we have them That s a question about politics not economics so maybe it s best directed to a different sort of expert In cases like this it s the economist s job to explain where we ought to be headed and the political scientist s job to explain why we can t get there from here
