 Maytag s Spin Cycle If you weren t paying attention last week and even if you were you might have missed the dramatic fall in the stock of washing machine maker Maytag which began on Wednesday and continued through Friday Although Maytag has gained a lot of attention recently for its fantastic high end Neptune washer and its high powered CEO it s not exactly the kind of company that makes your ears perk up But the story of what happened to Maytag or more precisely the story of how Wall Street reacted to what happened to Maytag is such a clear illustration of the Street s conviction that there s nothing wrong with inside information as to be almost a parody Maytag s stock was driven down because the company is going to fall far short of earnings estimates in the next two quarters Unfortunately Maytag investors didn t find that out until the company announced the shortfall Friday morning after two full days of massive selling on no news at all Well no public news that is Clearly lots of people knew something Now Maytag insists that it didn t even know things were going to be so bad until its sales numbers came in and that it didn t tell any of its big shareholders to get out before the bad news broke Perhaps But trading volume on Wednesday was three times normal and trading volume on Thursday was six times normal A lot of that of course was just momentum selling as people leapt out of the way of what quickly became a falling knife But the size of the trades was such that the whole situation looks decidedly sketchy Here s the quirk in the whole story though Among the people raising the possibility that large shareholders were informed in advance are analysts at some of Wall Street s biggest investment banks and brokerage houses And among the people most annoyed by the company s late announcement are those same analysts Why Because when they talked to Maytag Thursday night the company reassured them that nothing was wrong and that there would be no change in their earnings forecasts Let s get this straight The analysts are annoyed because Maytag didn t tell them that something was wrong before it told the public that something was wrong In other words Maytag didn t give the analysts the chance to tell their clients to sell before other investors realized something was wrong Of course this reaction was accepted as par for the course on the Street even though if Maytag had told analysts anything it would have been as blatant a case of selective disclosure as you can imagine And I d say this was astonishing except for the fact that selective disclosure remains a painfully common practice Non institutional investors are excluded from company conference calls and snubbed by investor relations people Companies continue to disclose material information to analysts before issuing press releases And they spend far more time talking to large shareholders than they do talking to the public The ironic thing then is that Maytag did the right thing Thursday night even if it looks as if someone at Maytag might have done the wrong thing a couple of days before When analysts call looking for information that will help their clients and only their clients companies should just say Buzz off If we have something important to say you ll find out when everyone else does Oh I how long to be a fly on the wall for that conversation Well actually I don t want to be a fly since they have short and miserable lives But you get the point
