 Introduction Diabetic nephropathy DNP is a serious and common complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus leading to end stage renal failure in up to 30 of individuals with diabetes Early abnormalities of DNP affect glomeruli and include an increase in glomerular filtration rate microalbuminuria glomerular hypertrophy and thickening of the glomerular basement membrane followed by expansion of mesangial extracellular matrix and glomerulosclerosis 1 2 As with most chronic degenerative kidney diseases the gradual decline of renal function at later stages of DNP is invariably associated with tubular epithelial degeneration TED also called tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis IF hallmarks of degeneration to end stage renal failure 3 Pathomechanisms that may initiate and or mediate TED in DNP remain poorly understood While glomerular lesions consistent with human DNP have been described in various mouse models of diabetes TED and IF have not been described in diabetic mice 4 Combining detailed renal phenotype analysis with gene expression profiling of hyperglycemic mouse models of type 1 streptozotocin STZ and type 2 db db diabetes we recently reported that decreased mRNA levels of CD36 in kidneys were strongly correlated with albuminuria 5 CD36 is a transmembrane protein of the class B scavenger receptor family and is involved in multiple biological processes 6 CD36 is widely expressed and may interact with multiple extracellular ligands including thrombospondin 1 TSP 1 long chain free fatty acids FFAs modified oxidized low density lipoprotein ox LDL advanced glycation end AGE products and collagens I and IV 6 CD36 mediates phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and malaria parasitized erythrocytes 7 Furthermore CD36 mediates antiangiogenic activity associated with endothelial cell apoptosis induced by TSP 1 through p38 MAP kinase MAPK and caspase 3 8 Hyperglycemia induced synthesis of CD36 protein in macrophages has been associated with increased uptake of ox LDL by macrophages and foam cell formation in atherosclerotic lesions in people with diabetes 6 9 10 While diabetic cardiovascular complications are closely linked epidemiologically with albuminuria and DNP a role for CD36 in DNP and renal pathophysiology has not to our knowledge been described to date Here we report a novel functional role for CD36 scavenger receptor and AGE and FFA palmitate PA in tubular epithelial apoptosis associated with TED and progression of DNP Specifically we show that glucose stimulates CD36 cell surface expression in proximal tubular epithelial cells PTECs and increased CD36 renders PTECs susceptible to both AGE and PA induced PTEC apoptosis by mediating sequential activation of src kinase proapoptotic p38 MAPK and caspase 3 Based on these findings we propose a new two step metabolic hit model for TED in the progression of DNP Methods Animals Kidneys were obtained from 28 wk old C57BLKS J lepr db db STZ

Human Kidney Biopsy Sample and Patient Characteristics Human kidney tissues ten controls ten with diabetic nephropathy and ten with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis FSGS were obtained from archived kidney biopsy samples or from discarded nephrectomy specimens All diabetic samples were from patients with biopsy proven advanced DNP with serum creatinine ranging from 1 7 to 5 6 mg dl 151 to 444 M l heavy proteinuria 3 by dipstick or 3 6 gr d and hypertension All patients with FSGS were from patients with creatinine levels of 1 7 to 4 9 mg dl 151 to 435 M l heavy proteinuria 3 by dipstick and hypertension The diagnosis of FSGS was made on Periodic acid Schiff staining in the absence of immunodeposits on electron microscopy The diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy was based on the presence of diabetes proteinuria and the characteristic light microscopy findings Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for procurement of kidney specimens at the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital Statistical Methods Data are reported as mean and standard error of the mean SEM for continuous variables All cell culture experiments were performed at least three times and summarized Standard software packages SPSS and Excel for Windows were used to provide descriptive statistical plots unpaired t tests The Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons Significance for the quantification of the CD36 staining in human biopsy samples was calculated via the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test Results Increased Expression of CD36 Specifically in Proximal Tubules of Human Diabetic Kidneys Is Associated with TED Using microarray based gene expression profiling on whole kidney RNA together with supervised clustering methods we previously identified and validated gene expression patterns for molecular classification of diabetic mice with albuminuria and mesangial expansion 5 Reduced renal mRNA levels of the class B scavenger receptor CD36 were characteristic for diabetic mice with albuminuria 5 Here we examined patterns of CD36 protein expression in kidneys of non diabetic and diabetic mice and humans CD36 protein was detectable in the thick ascending limb of loop of Henle and in the collecting duct and absent in proximal tubules in both control and diabetic mouse kidneys Figure 1A 1D In contrast CD36 was detectable only rarely in individual proximal tubular cells in sections from non diabetic human kidneys controls Figure 1E and 1H but was markedly increased specifically in PTECs in human diabetic kidneys Figure 1F and 1I In addition we did not observe increased proximal tubular CD36 expression in kidney biopsy samples from patients with FSGS Figure 1J that were matched with DNP samples for the severity of proteinuria all in the nephrotic range and renal insufficiency all with elevated serum creatinine 1 7 5 0 mg dl Semi quantitative analysis of the distribution and intensity of CD36 positive PTECs CD36 PTEC score which was performed by two independent pathologists in a blinded manner demonstrated that mean CD36 PTEC scores were not different between FSGS kidneys and normal human kidneys but were significantly increased in DNP kidneys Figure 1K Periodic acid Schiff stained sections of kidneys from mice exposed to type 2 diabetes db db mice for 20 wk Figure 2A or type 1 diabetes STZ treated C57BL 6J mice for 20 wk data not shown demonstrated moderate to advanced mesangial expansion and glomerulosclerosis Figure 2A Tubular abnormalities were not detectable in either model Figure 2A In contrast TED and IF were associated with moderate to advanced mesangial expansion and glomerulosclerosis on kidney sections of human DNP Figure 2B These findings indicate that in humans with DNP diabetes induced upregulation of CD36 expression in proximal tubules was associated with moderate to advanced stages of TED and IF In contrast in diabetic mice with albuminuria mesangial expansion and glomerulosclerosis absence of CD36 expression was associated with normal appearance of the tubular epithelium and interstitial space These findings suggest an association between diabetes induced proximal tubular CD36 expression and TED Coincidence of Increased CD36 Expression and Increased Tubular Epithelial Cell Apoptosis in Human DNP CD36 has been shown to mediate apoptosis signaling induced by TSP 1 in endothelial cells 8 and by ox LDL in macrophages 14 We examined whether the strong upregulation of CD36 protein in PTECs observed specifically in human DNP was associated with tubular epithelial cell apoptosis in vivo TUNEL positive tubular epithelial cells also stained positive for CD36 protein Figure 2D and aquaporin1 Figure 2C indicating that apoptosis and CD36 expression coincided in PTECs in human DNP In contrast CD36 was not detectable in TUNEL positive PTECs in non diabetic FSGS kidneys and in normal human kidney data not shown Statistical analysis showed that the rate of TUNEL positive tubular cells was significantly increased in kidneys of human DNP compared with normal control human kidney Figure 2E In addition tubular epithelial apoptosis was increased but highly variable in FSGS kidneys data not shown In contrast tubular epithelial apoptosis rates were comparable between non diabetic control and all diabetic mouse kidneys Figure 2E The diabetic mouse group included 24 wk old STZ treated diabetic C57BL 6J or 129SvJ mice 0 23 0 1 TUNEL positive cells per 100 tubular cells and 24 wk old lepr db db mice 0 2 0 1 TUNEL positive cells per 100 tubular cells Together these findings indicate that CD36 expression in PTECs is associated with apoptotic events of proximal tubular cells and TED specifically in human DNP but not in FSGS with matched functional and clinical abnormalities These in vivo findings demonstrate a strong association of diabetes induced CD36 expression and apoptosis in PTECs in human DNP suggesting that CD36 may play a critical role in TED by mediating PTEC apoptosis in progressive human DNP High Ambient Glucose Induces CD36 Expression in Human PTECs High ambient glucose has been shown to induce CD36 protein synthesis in macrophages 9 Because CD36 protein was markedly increased in proximal tubules in human DNP we examined the effects of high ambient glucose on CD36 mRNA and protein expression in the human PTEC line HK 2 Figure 3 Exposure of cells to 30 mM D glucose for 24 h but not to control L glucose significantly increased levels of CD36 mRNA Figure 3A CD36 cell surface protein Figure 3C and CD36 protein expression in cell lysates Figure 3D In contrast CD36 mRNA and protein were not detectable in the murine PTEC line MCT at either normal or high ambient glucose concentrations data not shown Interestingly glucose stimulation decreased CD36 mRNA levels Figure 3B and CD36 cell surface protein Figure 3C in the murine collecting duct cell line M1 consistent with our previously reported findings in diabetic mouse kidney 5 Exposure of human HK 2 and murine M1 cell lines to defined preparations of FFA PA or AGE BSA had no effect on CD36 mRNA and protein expression levels data not shown These findings demonstrate that high ambient glucose causes upregulation of CD36 mRNA and protein specifically in human but not in mouse PTECs Together with our in vivo observations these results suggest that hyperglycemia may induce upregulation of CD36 mRNA and protein selectively in proximal tubules in kidneys of human DNP but not diabetic mice with albuminuria AGE BSA CML BSA and FFA PA Induce Apoptosis in Human PTECs via CD36 AGE albumin 15 and FFAs 16 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications including tubular degeneration 17 and tubular epithelial to mesenchymal transition 18 In addition AGE albumin and FFA are known to interact with CD36 19 20 However it is not known whether AGE and or FFA can activate CD36 signaling and apoptosis in tubular epithelial cells Treatment with AGE BSA for 2 5 or 10 wk or with CML BSA induced a significant increase in the number of apoptotic nuclei in CD36 positive HK 2 cells compared with control BSA treated or untreated HK 2 cells Figure 4A In contrast AGE BSA and CML BSA had no effect on the rate of apoptotic nuclei in CD36 negative murine MCT PTECs data not shown Because AGE BSA glycated for 5 wk AGE BSA5 induced robust apoptosis at concentrations between 20 and 40 M Figure 4A we chose this preparation and concentration for further analysis in all subsequent experiments AGE BSA5 induced apoptosis was blocked when cells were preincubated with neutralizing anti CD36 antibody while preincubation with control IgG antibody had no effect Figure 4A These results were confirmed by DNA laddering assay data not shown Among the most abundant glucose modified proteins detectable in the plasma of diabetic individuals are CML proteins 21 which are typically present at 1 6 to 2 3 M concentrations in the plasma and urine of diabetic individuals 22 23 To use physiologically relevant CML proteins in our in vitro experiments we prepared CMLmin BSA characterized by glycation of approximately 30 of lysine residues 21 When applied to HK 2 PTECs at concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 10 M CMLmin BSA increased apoptosis rates significantly Figure 4B The proapoptotic effect of CMLmin BSA was blocked by CD36 neutralizing antibody but not by control IgG Figure 4B CD36 has been shown to transport fatty acids in adipocytes 24 and in muscle cells 25 Concentrations of FFAs may be substantially elevated to levels of up to 700 M in individuals with type 2 diabetes or obesity 26 Thus we examined the effects of saturated FFA PA and monounsaturated FFA oleate on apoptosis of HK 2 PTECs in the absence or presence of anti CD36 neutralizing antibody PA significantly increased rates of apoptotic nuclei in a concentration dependent manner in HK 2 PTECs Figure 4C Anti CD36 neutralizing antibody but not control IgG blocked PA induced apoptosis Figure 4C In contrast oleate did not induce apoptosis even at concentrations as high as 300 M Figure 4C neither did it prevent PA induced apoptosis data not shown Of note these experiments were performed using a total fatty acid BSA ratio of 6 6 1 in order to closely model pathophysiologic states in which unbound FFA concentration is high 27 Taken together our findings demonstrate that pathophysiologically relevant species of AGE BSA and CML BSA as well as saturated FFA PA induce apoptosis in human PTECs at concentrations previously observed in plasma and or urine in humans with diabetes AGE BSA and PA Sequentially Activate src kinase Proapoptotic p38 MAPK and Caspase 3 through CD36 Receptor CD36 has previously been shown to trigger the activation of p59fyn p38 MAPK and caspase 3 GeneID 836 in response to thrombospondin in endothelial cells 8 Therefore we examined phospho src phospho p38 levels and caspase 3 activation in HK 2 PTECs treated with AGE BSA and PA in the absence or presence of anti CD36 neutralizing antibody Both AGE BSA5 and PA increased phospho src levels rapidly after as little as 5 min and over a prolonged time interval up to 3 h Figure 5A and 5B Phosphorylation of src kinase was blocked by anti CD36 neutralizing antibody Figure 5A and 5B This observation is consistent with previous findings demonstrating direct interaction between CD36 and p59fyn 8 however the involvement of other src kinases cannot be excluded We also observed increased levels of phosphorylation of p38 MAPK beginning 1 to 2 h after treatment and p38 activation was also completely blocked by anti CD36 neutralizing antibody Figure 5C and 5D These findings indicate that CD36 activates proapoptotic p38 MAPK possibly via src kinase activation in human PTECs when stimulated with AGE BSA5 and PA Chemical inhibition of p38 MAPK prevented the increase in the rate of apoptotic nuclei induced by both AGE BSA5 and PA in HK 2 PTECs Figure 5G indicating that p38 MAPK function is required for apoptosis induced by AGE BSA and PA through CD36 receptor AGE BSA and PA significantly increased activity of effector caspase 3 in human PTECs Figure 5E and 5F Caspase 3 activation was blocked by anti CD36 neutralizing antibody but not by control IgG Figure 5E and 5F Pan caspase inhibitor z VAD fmk and the specific caspase 3 inhibitor z DEVD fmk prevented apoptosis induced by PA and AGE BSA while the specific caspase 9 inhibitor z LEHD fmk had no significant inhibitor effect Figure 5G Together these findings indicate that CD36 receptor mediates sequential phosphorylation of src kinases and p38 MAPK leading to activation of caspase 3 and apoptosis in human PTECs exposed to AGE BSA and PA ligands Interestingly we did not observe phosphorylation of Smad2 and p42 44 ERK MAPK under these conditions as previously reported for AGE binding to the RAGE receptor 28 CD36 Is Sufficient to Mediate Apoptosis Induced by AGE BSA and FFA In contrast with CD36 positive human HK 2 PTECs we found that treatment of CD36 negative mouse MCT PTECs with AGE BSA had no effect on rates of apoptotic nuclei data not shown To test whether CD36 was sufficient to mediate AGE BSA induced apoptosis we transfected CD36 negative mouse MCT PTECs with a plasmid expressing human CD36 or empty control vector followed by treatment with control BSA or AGE BSA5 AGE BSA5 treatment had no significant effect on rates of apoptotic nuclei in MCT PTECs transfected with control vector Figure 6 In contrast AGE BSA significantly increased apoptotic nuclei compared with unglycated BSA in MCT PTECs transiently transfected with CD36 expression vector Figure 6 Nonglycated control albumin did not cause apoptosis Thus transgenic de novo expression of human CD36 in CD36 negative mouse PTECs was sufficient to mediate apoptosis induced by AGE BSA Discussion Advanced diabetic nephropathies in humans with type 1 or type 2 diabetes are uniformly characterized by TED or tubular atrophy and IF leading to renal failure 29 30 Although TED and IF are the strongest predictors for progression of DNP 31 mechanisms that underlie TED in DNP remain poorly understood Based on our in vitro and in vivo findings we propose a two step metabolic hit model for TED in DNP High ambient glucose but not AGE or FFA cause stimulation of CD36 expression in PTECs specifically in diabetic kidneys Increased CD36 expression mediates sequential activation of src kinase proapoptotic p38 MAPK and caspase 3 in PTECs in the presence of AGE and FFA PA resulting in PTEC apoptosis Proximal tubular epithelial apoptosis may be an initial mechanism for TED in DNP Our conclusions are supported by several key observations First we identify a new functional role for CD36 as an essential mediator of proximal tubular epithelial apoptosis inducible by AGE BSA CMLmin BSA and FFA PA Previous reports demonstrated a role for CD36 in mediating apoptosis induced by TSP 1 in endothelial cells and ox LDL in macrophages 8 14 In the present study we show for the first time to our knowledge that CD36 mediates apoptosis in differentiated epithelial cells that are exposed to AGE BSA CMLmin BSA and FFA induced metabolic injury characteristic of the diabetic milieu Interestingly AGE albumins and CML are present in the urine of individuals with diabetes with albuminuria due to DNP and have been shown to bind proximal tubular epithelium 22 32 While the presence or absence of FFAs in the urine of diabetics with DNP has not been determined to date FFAs may cause tubular apoptosis 33 It remains to be determined whether FFA interacts with CD36 to activate CD36 receptor signaling or whether CD36 mediates FFA uptake to activate src kinase and p38 MAPK signaling Irrespective of the upstream mechanism of FFA and CD36 interaction our results demonstrate very rapid activation of a well characterized intracellular kinase cascade of proapoptotic signaling Our finding that AGE BSA and PA induce apoptosis through a CD36 mediated and p38 and caspase dependent mechanism in tubular epithelial cells similar to TSP 1 and ox LDL in endothelial cells and macrophages respectively suggests that multiple context dependent extracellular stimuli of apoptosis may converge on CD36 scavenger receptor to activate src kinase and proapoptotic p38 MAPK pathway In the context of the diabetic milieu and diabetic complications our findings provide new molecular insights into diabetes induced AGE and FFA dependent injury of renal epithelial cells Almost all TUNEL positive apoptotic tubular epithelial cells showed increased expression of CD36 suggesting a strong correlation between upregulation of CD36 expression and increased apoptosis in PTECs specifically in human diabetic kidney in vivo Importantly biopsy samples from cases of FSGS that were matched for degree of proteinuria renal function and hypertension were characterized by TED IF and increased tubular epithelial apoptosis however proximal tubular CD36 expression was similar to that in normal human control kidney Therefore CD36 expression in PTECs is specifically associated with the diabetic condition and appears to be independent of degree of proteinuria and renal failure Indeed increased CD36 expression in PTECs in human DNP in vivo may be caused by hyperglycemia as we show that high glucose concentration stimulates CD36 expression in vitro It is intriguing that CD36 expression was not detected in PTECs in diabetic mice with longstanding hyperglycemia in vivo although underlying mechanisms for the species dependent differential regulation of CD36 in PTECs in vivo and in vitro between mouse and human remain unclear at this time Comparisons of human CD36 and mouse Cd36 genes indicate a high degree of sequence and structural similarity in both coding and regulatory regions suggesting that the mechanism or mechanisms that underlie our findings are likely determined by sequence independent epigenetically distinct response patterns to the diabetic milieu that differ between these species It is also possible that dietary or metabolic factors account for the differences in CD36 expression as mice were maintained on standard mouse chow characterized by significantly lower fat and cholesterol contents than typical western diets consumed by humans However dietary or other unknown environmental factors cannot explain the differential CD36 regulation by glucose in human and mouse PTECs Thus we are exploring whether biochemical or functional differences between mouse and human PTECs in glucose metabolism or glucose induced signaling can be identified However current lack of understanding of the observed differential regulation between human and mouse does not diminish the translational research significance of our findings with their clear therapeutic implications Thus the present study identifies a new CD36 dependent molecular signaling pathway that mediates tubular epithelial apoptosis and may underlie TED and IF hallmarks of disease progression specifically in human diabetic nephropathy Third to our knowledge our report provides the first controlled study demonstrating increased apoptosis specifically in PTECs in DNP with TED and IF These findings are consistent with a recent uncontrolled case series of five patients with DNP 34 and with previous reports demonstrating tubular apoptosis in kidneys of STZ treated diabetic rats 35 36 Interestingly our study shows that tubular epithelial apoptosis was associated with TED and IF in human DNP while normal appearance of tubular epithelium and interstitium was associated with baseline apoptosis rates in diabetic mouse models Together published observations from experimental diabetes models in mouse and rat and human DNP and our own findings in diabetic mouse models and human DNP suggest a striking association of TED and tubular epithelial apoptosis However whether tubular epithelial apoptosis causes TED in DNP will require further investigation Interestingly acute and chronic chemical inhibition of caspase activity in a nephrotoxic serum nephritis model of chronic progressive glomerulonephritis with TED and IF reduced tubular apoptosis and TED 37 Decreased tubular apoptosis and TED were associated with significantly reduced IF and decreased collagen synthesis in this model This finding suggests that tubular epithelial apoptosis may trigger TED and IF in this model of chronic glomerulonephritis in rat and supports our conclusions that diabetes induced tubular epithelial apoptosis may underlie TED associated with IF in human DNP In conclusion we report a new functional role for CD36 scavenger receptor in tubular epithelial apoptosis associated with tubular degeneration and progression of DNP Specifically we show for the first time that both AGE and FFA PA induce PTEC apoptosis through CD36 mediated activation of src kinase p38 MAPK and caspase 3 Because high glucose stimulates CD36 expression in human PTECs and because CD36 expression is increased in apoptotic tubular epithelial cells in human DNP we propose a two step
