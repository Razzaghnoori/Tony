 Tea With the Local Saint By J D McClatchy posted Wednesday March 18 To hear the poet read Tea With the Local Saint click I d bought a cone of solid sugar and a boxOf tea for the saint himself a felt tip penFor his son the saint elect and bubblegumFor a confusion of small fry the five year oldAunt say and her seven year old nephew Nothing for the women of course the tattooed One eyed moon faced matron or her daughterWhose husband had long ago run awayAfter killing their newborn by pouringA bottle of cheap cologne down its throat This was after all our first meeting I was to be introduced by a Peace Corps palWhose easy open California waysHad brought a water system to the villageAnd an up to date word to its vocabulary Every other guttural spillway of ArabicIncluded a carefully enunciated awesome The speaker bright eyed with his own banter We sat on a pair of Kurt Cobain beach towelsAnd under a High Quality Quartz Clock The plastic butterflies attached to whose handsSeemed to keep time with those in my stomach At last he entered the room the saint himself Moulay Madani in a white head scarf and caftanThe fading blue of a map s Moroccan coastline Its hem embroidered with geometric ports of call A rugged sixty with a longshoreman s jaw A courtier s guile and a statesman s earnest pauses He first explained the crescent dagger he fingeredHad been made two centuries ago by a clever Jew Then he squinted for my reaction I ve no tasteFor bad blood and gingerly cleared my throat to sayI was inclined to trust any saint who carried a knife From a copper urn glasses of mint tea were poured Of a tongue stiffening sweetness I was allowed to waveAway the tray of nougat or rather the flies on it Sipping I waited for a word a sign from the saint I d wanted to lie as if underground and watch Him dig up the sky or stand at a riverbankAnd have the water sweep off my presumptions Have him blow light into my changeling bones I wanted to feel the stalk rise and the blade fall I wanted my life s arithmetic glazed and fired I wanted the hush the wingstroke the shudder But sainthood I learned soon enough is a fateWorse than life nights on call for the demonsIn a vomiting lamb a dry breast a broken radio And days spent parroting the timeless adages Spent arbitrating water rights property lines Or feuds between rival herdsmen over scrub brush Spent blessing every bride and anyone s big belliedFourth or fifth wife praying that they deliver sons I thought back to the time not ten feet from him I heard a homily delivered by old John XXIII Sounding wholly seraphic in his murmured Italian Ten interpreters stepped from behind the throne The English one at last explained the Holy FatherHad urged us all to wear seatbelts while driving My heart sank at its plain good sense as hymnsEchoed and golden canopies enfolded the pope How like home it seemed with my own fatherA preoccupied patriarch of practicalityWhen what was wanted veered wildly betweenThe gruff headmaster and the drunken playwright Instead I got the distant advertising salesman The suburban dad of what turned out to be my dreams Dreams that decades later back at my hotel in Fez A bucket of cold water was suddenly poured on I d gone to the hammam stripped and lay on a patternOf sopping tiles that might have spelled God s will Steam shrouded the attendant methodically soapingThe knots of disappointment he d knuckled in my back He paused I drifted The freezing shock I looked upAt a bald toothless gnome in swaddling clothesOn his way back to the fountain for more bad news Something in his bowlegged walk perhaps the wearyRoutine of it made me think of the saint again Of how when tea was done and everyone had stood He reached for my head put his hands over it And gently pulled me to his chest which smelledOf dung smoke and cinnamon and mutton grease I could hear his wheezy breathing now like the prophet s Last whispered word repeated by the faithful Then he prayed for what no one had time to translate His son interrupted the old man to tell him a groupOf snake charmers sought his blessing and a blind thief The saint pushed me away took one long look Then straightened my collar and nodded me toward the door
