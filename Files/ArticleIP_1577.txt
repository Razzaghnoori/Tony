 Slates You Can Wear Hotel Ballroom produced by Paul Wolfe Jeff Iorillo Corey Stolberg and Robert Gondell of Foote Cone Belding in San Francisco The inevitabilities of age dictate that Generation Xers grow up get a job and go places whether they want to or not But the age old question remains What to wear This spot Hotel Ballroom produced for Levi Strauss by Foote Cone Belding suggests to Gen Xers that your pants can have the same attitude as you still young they re Levi s but not jeans and a good fit comfortable in your own identity yet at ease in the establishment world Well just enough to get by At first look we don t know what the ad s about We see a twentysomething guy wearing a tie but no coat it s in the garment bag wear it only when you have to entering a grand hotel The lobby which is shot in black and white possesses a grandeur seldom seen today outside beaux arts train stations There s a sense of something older in this space but not of the past It s the time space of grown up commitments where the Gen Xer has to live at least part time Maybe color is reserved for nights and weekends But even in the black and white world the Gen X attitude is still evident The clerk initially seen upside down hints at a world turned on its head As the guy in the pants approaches the desk the clerk accepts that he belongs Like the pants our hero fits but in his own way With a wan smile he asks for the phone The clerk half reluctantly points it out He can t question the Gen Xer who s carrying an attach case this guy could be anything even a young computer mogul As he strides toward the phone we hear the narrator s voice for the first time You know those pants that always fit But our hero doesn t find the phone he gets a little lost This world may accept him as fitting in but he s in it not of it He s kind of an innocent abroad innocent of course in a limited sense He wanders into a political rally and ends up on stage We see the scene from the Gen Xer s perspective the politician s evident insincerity aren t all politics staged and phony and the endemic irrelevance of the proceedings Our hero s demeanor speaks volumes as the politician shakes his hand and photos are taken as mementos of this nonevent But he does fit in if only for a moment and in his own way before extricating himself and moving on Almost Zelig like in the succeeding scenes he continues to fit in without getting permanently trapped He backs across the stage toward a podium where they are giving out awards is this a case of mistaken award giving or is he just a reluctant winner He s too young and there are too many self congratulatory award ceremonies anyway the ad seems to say In another scene he fits into a wedding There you are the grandmother says but at least he s not the groom he s not yet dressed in one of those rented black tie outfits that never seem to fit The background for the picture is a painted outdoor scene That s where he d rather be Instead he s suddenly in the hotel hallway again Hands on hips he pauses then strides toward another of those situations in which maturing Gen Xers will inevitably find themselves as we hear the only other bit of narration in the spot These are those pants these are Slates The hotel clerk s hand hits the bell summoning a bellhop to take our hero to his room or is it a suite What happened to the garment bag or briefcase Did he check them Did he ever find the phone and where s his cellular At the end we glimpse once more the rich wood paneled hallway Does it lead to a dead end or to a doorway Whatever it is the ad seems to say you can go there wearing your Slates and still be yourself You can write what you want on a slate it isn t just a copybook You can go where you have to wearing Slates without losing your identity You re still wearing Levi s even if you re the only one who knows it In their world you re still Gen X and you still see it all the same way mostly Robert Shrum
