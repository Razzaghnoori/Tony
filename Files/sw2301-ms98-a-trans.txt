 so do you have any credit cards yes i do i keep uh i have an American Express and a Visa card that i keep you know kind of for emergency purposes and i have you know i use a gasoline credit card which i you know pay off every every month um hum but i ve i ve gotten rid of all of the credit cards you know that i possibly could and my balances are practically zero on the ones that i have okay especially since you know it s no longer after this year or after tax year nineteen ninety there s there s no deductions for you know credit card interest that you pay so it s a um hum you know gosh credit cards run what anywhere from up to eighteen nineteen percent i guess yeah it s just a bad deal course there are emergencies you know that you you know probably need to have a card yeah i have one card uh huh that s that s probably enough and i try not to use it but right now it s maxed out absolutely yeah it s it s very easy to you know to do that or you know to abuse it it really is it s so easy to pull out the plastic um hum but we re trying our best not to not to add any you know credit card debt to our structure here yeah um i have uh the thing that that bothers me worse than the credit cards i think is uh you mentioned the gasoline credit card uh huh i don t have that but i ve got you know one of the the uh instant teller cards uh huh that you can use for point of sale purchases and we use that usually to buy gasoline and it s just it s really amazing how quickly that goes uh huh uh huh uh huh uh huh i m sure you re right i don t i don t i don t participate in that but you know a lot of folks do um hum yeah at least with the uh gasoline company credit cards you have you know up to thirty twenty five thirty days you know interest free for it yeah but you know the instant thing may be may may be the way of the future to you know to replace checks and every other thing yeah that s what they ve they ve talked about it of course it eliminates any waiting period and God help those people who have to float checks occasionally because you won t be able to with that yeah it certainly does absolutely that s right do you get any sort of discount when you use a card like that no i see oh it was well they consider it to be the same as cash i see i see i well because it actually is yeah it s better than cash it certainly is yeah uh huh they don t even have to deposit it it just goes straight in there that s right no returned checks or anything right yeah no i i understand it s becoming you know the popular thing to do we re not participating in that particular program at the moment and i don t really perceive doing it unless we absolutely have to um hum but uh i have in times past gotten into a bit of trouble with credit cards it s just you know too easy to do yeah but i m so glad he told me that when that they they got to such a point with their credit cards they didn t want to cut them up because they were afraid sometime they might actually need them that s right they paid them off and then they stuck them in a thing of water and froze them she said at least before she could use them she d have to thaw them out i mean that s funny well that s a novel idea yeah that would cause you think a little while wouldn t it that may not be a bad idea but i m kind of getting a little more leery of credit cards you know as time goes by unless you just absolutely have to now there are times when you d at least think you do anyway yeah yeah i i want to still have just one just in case but i d sure want to get the get it paid down and not use it for a while so we yeah yeah yeah that s right my wife and i really i guess are fortunate we re really not compulsive shoppers you know we we plan purchases you know pretty well you know watch for the best buys things like that um hum but uh some people have a real problem with it yeah well our our limit is you know fairly low uh huh and uh so that s that s one thing that s good sure absolutely yeah oh i ve got another call oh i m sorry it was nice talking to you okay take care all right bye bye bye bye
