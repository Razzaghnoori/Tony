 Edward J Gleiman Speech before the Envelope Manufacturers Association Williamsburg VA October 29 2000 Good morning ladies and gentlemen The law provides that the Postal Service may from time to time request that the Postal Rate Commission recommend rates and fees that shall provide sufficient revenues so that total estimated income to the Postal Service will equal as nearly as practicable total estimated costs of operating the Postal Service On January 12th the Postal Service submitted such a request seeking an additional 3 7 million dollars in revenue to be generated by an overall average rate increase of approximately 6 4 percent After lengthy deliberations during which the Commission held 40 days of hearings to consider 178 pieces of testimony presented by 122 witnesses representing 77 participants including the Postal Service the Commission has concluded that the Wait a minute I think I picked up the wrong presentation on my way out of the office yesterday Let me try again Good morning ladies and gentlemen When Maynard invited me to visit with you I plumb forgot that the Commission would be in the final throes of the R2000 1 rate case in late October So while it would certainly be a pleasure to be here under normal circumstances I want to extend a special thanks to you for having me here today If for no other reason it has provided an excuse to escape for a day the pressure cooker atmosphere associated with putting the finishing touches on a major rate case decision Good Lord willing and the creek don t rise or perhaps I should say if the computers don t crash we hope to have that decision out on Monday November 13th Maynard suggested that I talk about the future about postal reform its impact on the Commission and other changes the postal community may be facing Before I whip out my somewhat cloudy crystal ball I thought you might be interested in a brief outline of the process currently associated with postal rate making And as I talk about the process I will attempt to debunk a few myths and set the record straight on what you may have heard at previous get togethers I will also talk about an issue that I believe has greater potential to impact the future well being of the Postal Service and the postal community than the much discussed diversion of transactional mail to electronic bill paying Prior to 1970 postage rates were set by the Congress Rates generally did not cover the costs of providing service so Congress appropriated tax dollars to make up the difference The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 changed all that It replaced the Post Office Department with a new United States Postal Service and charged it with operating in a more business like fashion Congress would no longer set postal rates but it wanted to ensure that the public had an opportunity to be heard before the Postal Service changed rates or services Therefore it simultaneously established a separate independent Postal Rate Commission to provide an open process in which the public could participate in the development of postage rates Myth Number One Contrary to what you may have heard or read although the PRC was not among the 1968 recommendations of the Kappel Commission appointed by the President to study the future of the Post Office Department neither did it spring forth like a phoenix from the ashes in some secret conference between House and Senate legislators Permit me if you will to correct the record The key elements were there the entire time I read from the conference report on the 1970 Act at page 84 The House bill contained a Postal Rate Board as an independent agency not part of the Postal Service The Senate amendment contained an independent Postal Rate Commission within the Postal Service The conference substitute adopts the House provision for a freestanding entity changing the name to the Senate proposed Postal Rate Commission Perhaps there is a lesson or two here for those who yearn for a new Kappel type presidential commission as some sort of panacea to make recommendations to mold the future of the Postal Service Commissions study and recommend the President proposes and the Congress disposes as it sees fit Congress intended that mailers should be able to use the Postal Rate Commission s proceedings to assure that some mailers were not crosssubsidizing other mailers and to assure that postage rates reflected the costs actually incurred to provide service Further by requiring the Service to justify rate and service changes Congress hoped to provide a check on inefficiency Each of you probably has your own point of view on how well the system works to keep the Postal Service lean and efficient But I hope you would agree that if mailers participate and if the Postal Service is subject to public scrutiny the result is likely to be better than if proposals go entirely unreviewed A case in point can be found in the last omnibus rate case the R97 1 case Mailer participation in developing the public evidentiary record was responsible in part for enabling the Commission to shave some 750 million almost one third off of the Service s request for additional revenue As a result almost everyone received a smaller rate increase than would have otherwise been the case Another example periodicals mailers stung by sharply rising costs associated with the processing of their mail insisted that postal officials join them in an effort aimed at finding answers and ferreting intervenor told us on the record a rocket shot compared to most rate type proceedings Moreover when the Commission does attempt to shave some time off of the 10 months provided in the law representatives of mailers both large and small object Mailers want as much time as possible to examine the reams of data the Postal Service provides in support of its proposals With their money at stake Mailers prefer that things be done right rather than fast By the way the original 1970 law contained no time limit on rate cases The 10 month limit was added after one of the early cases overseen by an administrative law judge recruited from another agency seemed to go on forever Some think that we ought to go back in time ought to get rid of the Commission and replace it with not one but three administrative law judges to be borrowed from some other government agency Bad idea But don t take my word for it Shakespeare wanted me to remind those who prefer a return to Admin Law Judges that What s past is prologue And Santayana asked me to add that Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it I mentioned that the Commission also has other responsibilities which impact the postal community These include 1 approving both changes in existing services and the establishment of new services those are known as classification cases 2 adjudicating complaints from anyone who believes the Postal Service is not providing rates or services as required by law 3 issuing advisory opinions when the Postal Service proposes a substantially nationwide change in the nature of its services and 4 our mostly recently assigned task providing Congress with annual reports about the costs and revenues of international mail Finally the Commission is given 120 days to consider appeals from those who contend the Postal Service has proposed closing their local post office without following the safeguard procedures Congress wrote into law This brings me to Myth Number Three The Postal Service cannot close a post office without first obtaining the approval of the Postal Rate Commission which supposedly takes four years The facts are that the PRC gets involved in only appeals of closings and then for only 120 days That s four months Not four years You can t get four years out of the equation even if you use Washington fuzzy math And how many closings have been appealed According to a 1997 GAO report only 296 of 2 614 closings were appealed over a 20 year period I make that to be about 11 percent And what was the disposition of those appeals you ask USPS affirmed in 170 cases 31 cases dismissed and only 58 remanded on grounds that the USPS had not complied with the procedural requirements of the law Number of times the Commission took more than 120 days to rule on an appeal Zero Number of cases in which the USPS was told by the Postal Rate Many years ago when I was just starting my government career one of my mentors gave me some advice in the way of a quote purportedly from one Petronius Arbiter in 210 B C Actually I m not opposed to change to postal reform During my time at the Commission we ve made quite a few changes We ve issued rules to encourage experimentation by the Postal Service and established procedures for expedited treatment of non controversial cases We ve established a website on which we post overnight every document filed with the Commission and we ve created a search engine that enables everyone to word search these documents Want to find out how many times and in what context the aspect ratio of envelopes was mentioned in the current rate case How about in each and every case all the way back to 1971 Try our website Change is not the problem The problem is my concern is that much of what has been on the table in the way of postal reform over the past several years is tantamount to an uncontrolled and uncontrollable experiment Maybe it is my training in the sciences coming to the fore or maybe it s my belief that the Postal Service is too important to our economy and too intertwined in our everyday lives and livelihood to leave too much to chance Let me make clear at this point that I have a great deal of admiration for Representative John McHugh and his staff In the almost 17 years I spent on Capitol Hill I cannot remember more than a handful of instances in which a member invested more of him or herself in an issue And although I took issue with a number of provisions in his bill I consider it unfortunate that the Chairman has run out of time in his search for the Holy Grail of postal reform It is unclear who if anyone will take up the challenge in the 107th Congress In the event that someone does take up the McHugh gauntlet and seeks your support I think it is important that you that mailers not just blindly endorse a bill simply because its title includes the phrase postal reform Which rates would be lawful in this scenario The capped rates that do not cover cost or the rates that exceed the cap but cover costs What s a Postal Regulatory Commissioner to do More to the point what s a mailer really likely to experience in the way of rate increases By the way it s not altogether clear that this price cap regime would achieve one of its other principle objectives that is to put downward pressure on future cost increases Why Because the bill has an exigencies escape clause and another provision that prohibits the PRC from taking any action that might impact labor negotiations No I m not suggesting that the last provision I mentioned be drop from any future bill I do think however that some consideration should be given to a statutory revenue cap as one means of adding a bit of starch to the spine cost containment Without an effective cost containment program and I have yet to see one the Postal Service reformed or not cannot be what mailers want It cannot be a low cost efficient provider of service These examples are just a couple of the problems in the reform bill that many in the community wanted to put on a fast track through Congress Everyone talks about how it has been 30 years since the Postal Reorganization Act was enacted that the postal landscape is very different that now is time to change the law Again I am not opposed to legislative reform but if we are going to put our money on legislative reform we had better get it right because once that next major postal bill a reform bill is enacted it may be another 30 more years before we get a shot at fixing things again And what would legislative reform mean for the PRC If something akin to H R 22 were enacted the Commission would be neither strengthened norweakened It would be different It would be relegated largely to after the fact audits as opposed to its current pre approved role And it would grow to perhaps three or four times its current complement of 55 bodies Now while we are figuring out what should be done in the way of legislative change we the postal community the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission should not just sit back and wait There is much to explore much that can be done within the confines of current law We need to push the edges of the envelope all them The EMA is already working on a number of forward thinking projects As one of the world s slowest and worst typists I guess they call it keyboarding now I especially like the idea of envelopes carrying information I can scan into my computer to connect with a vendor s website or with an information source Let me throw out a few of my ideas for change that are not conditioned on congressional action NSAs or negotiated service agreements have been a hot topic in the legislative equation NSAs are for all intents and purposes not very different from narrowly drawn classification proposals a number of which the Commission has received and approved over the past few years If the Service has any such proposals on the drawing board it ought to send them over If mailers have ideas they ought to submit them If someone thinks we need to modify our regulations to encourage niche classification cases let us know NSAs are doable under current law Why wait for legislation if we can act now to drive costs out of the system and lower rates for qualified mailers Just before the R97 case was filed when many in the community were concerned about the size of the Service s request I suggested that a case calling for rates to be phased in over time might help avoid the rate shock that comes with large double digit increases This was not an entirely new idea It was a take off on a joint USPS PRC task force recommendation in the early 90s for a four year rate cycle with a mid cycle adjustment These proposals reflected the purported desire of mailers for smaller and implicitly more frequent rate increases We now seem to be in a two year rate case cycle Mailers are however understandably concerned over the cost of litigating these more frequent cases But by phasing in rates they may be able to have their cake and eat it too smaller periodic increases and fewer cases to litigate It is time I believe to dust off the task force recommendation and or to give some serious thought to the phased rate approach I mentioned our website a bit earlier We ve been told that getting documents posted overnight and providing a search engine has resulted in substantial savings to intervenors and the Postal Service The Commission can and should do more in this area With a little cooperation from the community I think we can implement electronic filing and service of documents I ve already made several suggestions in the package services area When I spoke to the Parcel Shippers Association in June of last year I suggested that given the Service s economies of scale in delivery alliances with other transportation or delivery firms to carry their parcels the last mile made sense and would make dollars for the Postal Service This is happening already I ve also suggested that the Service explore making low weight Parcel Post a wholesale only product and pushing low weight over the counter retail parcels into Priority Mail The price differential between Priority Mail and single piece parcels is very small For just a couple of cents more an individual can send a package Priority and if the individual purchases delivery confirmation it becomes actually less expensive to use the faster Priority Mail service Faster service at a lower price means satisfied customers Speaking of delivery confirmation it is currently available for Priority and Parcel Post The USPS has proposed extending this service to Standard mail My thought here Why stop with Standard There are roughly a quarter billion pieces of First Class mail for which individuals purchase the more expensive Certified Mail option Delivery of a Certified Mail piece is more costly to the Postal Service than handling a delivery confirmation piece Certified mail requires the carrier to make a special trip to the door If the carrier is already equipped with a scanner for delivery confirmation purposes the Service has an opportunity to avoid the time and time is money that it takes the carrier to make that special trip to the door Delivery confirmation provide more information quicker at less cost to both the Postal Service and the customer As an old vaudevillian might say I ve got a million of em Well maybe not that many but it is I think time to move on I do want to assure you though that while I have been talking trees I have not lost sight of the forest Last October there was a congressional hearing at which the General Accounting Office presented unverified Postal Service estimates of the impact of the diversion of First Class mail bills and payments to new technologies The lead on the story was USPS volume to decline with a loss of 17 billion in revenue At 33 cents a pop I make that to be just short of 50 billion pieces of mail And the price of a stamp according to the story it would increase by 17 cents That is a pretty bleak picture However at the risk of being labeled a troglodyte may I suggest that if you scratch the surface of that picture you might find that a few rays of sunshine still remain for hard copy mail While I have no doubt there will be diversion my uneducated guess is that the glide path will be longer and the incline not so steep Many believe that there will be gains to offset losses in transactional mail volume For instance Bob Wientzen of DMA reported just a couple of weeks ago that high tech ventures are generating new volumes of hard copy mail as what he called pure play Web companies launch catalogues and direct mail campaigns to drive traffic to their Web sites Maynard expressed similar views in a news article this past summer Moreover unless the Postal Service is incapable of shedding volume variable costs or waits until 2008 before adjusting First Class rates the price of a stamp does not have to go up by 17 cents Unless it waits until 2008 to shore up its base volume declines May not be so severe What if I m wrong What if the worst case scenario does come to pass As I recall from the numbers in that July 20th Atlanta Journal Constitution article there goes much of that 8 percent of envelopes that currently carry bills and payments That is not a pleasant prospect but it is a heck of a lot better than the prospect of losing a big chunk of the remaining 92 percent of your business because an overreaching law restricts the sharing of personal information and results in direct marketing volumes going south Personal privacy one s right to control the use of his or her personal information is a hot issue It is a hard one to be against And it is a dangerous one to ignore either as an individual or as a business person Elements of the postal or mailing community or whatever you might call it have been engaged in the privacy issue at both the federal and state levels More often than not those involved have been the businesses that would feel directly the impact of restrictions on the collection and sharing of person data the list companies the direct marketers Think about this if the direct marketers and list companies are forced to cut back because of data restrictions won t that impact the manufacture of goods that are marketed Might it result in printers printing fewer catalogues Won t it impact the envelope manufactures And could it not result in a decline in Postal Service volumes across the board Those members of the greater mailer postal community who have not been paying attention to the privacy issue must do so They must join with others in a broad based coalition that ignores differences they may have on traditional postal issues If there is less information and less prospecting there will be fewer sales Fewer sales means fewer parcels to deliver whether by white trucks with an eagle or big brown trucks The community needs as a whole I believe to be proactive in pursuing of a rational nation wide approach that addresses both the concerns the rights of individuals and the needs of the business community I cut my teeth on information policy and personal privacy issues about 25 years ago as project manager at the then Department of Health Education and Welfare I worked directly on implementation of the federal records Privacy Act of 1974 and the 1974 school records access law I support the cornerstone concept of these laws known as fair information practices And I submit that the federal privacy law governs the collection and use of personal data by federal agencies and which provides agencies a modicum of flexibility is a reasonable point of departure for future discussions of either industry selfregulation or legislation I had best stop at this point since I ve taken more time and spouted off more than I should have But let me leave you with a thought to keep in mind in the event you are asked to evaluate my presentation This fellow is flying a hot air balloon and suddenly realizes he is lost He cuts back on the hot air descends and yells to a man he spots on the ground Excuse me can you tell me where I am Sure the man yells back you re in a hot air balloon about 30 feet above this field The balloonist yells back You must work in information technology I do replies the man but how did you know Well shouts the balloonist everything you told me was technically correct but it s of no use to anyone The man on the ground thinks for a moment and yells back You must work in management Why yes I do replies the balloonist proudly but how did you know Well says the man on the ground you don t know where you are or where you are going but you expect me to be able to help You re in the same position you were in before we met but now it s my fault Thank you for having me here this morning
