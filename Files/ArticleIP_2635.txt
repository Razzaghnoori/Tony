 The Financial News Fad I believe it was the transformation of Maria Bartiromo into a household name that told me that something new was really afoot Granted she s only a household name in certain households but the 30 year old host of CNBC s Business Center has enjoyed a precipitous ascent up the fame ladder seeing herself featured in Newsweek and USA Today and interviewed by David Letterman Bartiromo in short has been anointed the new face of the new boom in business news The boom can be seen in the arrival of business news on the front pages of daily newspapers the rise of business coverage at mainstream publications like GQ and Vanity Fair and above all in the new attention being paid to television networks like CNBC and CNNfn The buzz at least is that the growing diffusion of stock ownership has made Americans care much more about the stock market than ever before while the uncontested authority of the free market has placed business at the center of the culture As it happens it s difficult to figure out whether business news really is much more popular or whether network executives and media analysts have just decided it should be CNBC s business shows have an average viewership of somewhere between 120 000 and 150 000 The network s viewership peaked at just over a million when the market crashed Oct 27 CNNfn meanwhile still gets hash marks instead of Nielsen ratings which means that its audience is so small that it can t be measured And while Moneyline CNN s 7 p m business roundup hosted by Lou Dobbs who s also in charge of CNNfn often draws close to half a million viewers that s still insignificant next to anything the major networks do Of course CNNfn is hindered by the fact that so few cable systems carry it it s available in only 8 9 million homes For its part CNBC insists that its audience during the trading day is underestimated by at least 40 percent because a significant number of brokers and traders supposedly keep their televisions tuned to it as they go about their business This may well be true but even if it is it doesn t tell us very much about the broader impact of the financial news boom since those analysts presumably have always paid serious attention to the market Nonetheless it seems likely that the growing importance of the stock market to the retirement plans of middle class Americans has translated into stepped up coverage of business news and a greater willingness on the part of mainstream news outlets daily newspapers and network television to showcase pieces on market turmoil The problem is that the new wave of business news doesn t really illuminate the workings of the system all that well In fact most so called business news isn t really news about business the creation and distribution of goods and services at all Instead most of it is market news fruitless attempts to explain what traders are going to do in the near future or somewhat beside the point explanations of why traders did what they did in the near past If CNBC and CNNfn are the sports pages of the late 1990s the way they cover the stock market is analogous to a football commentator worrying more about a team s popularity than about its won lost record To be sure if you watch CNBC all day long you ll pick up some interesting news about particular companies and the economy as a whole Unfortunately to get to the useful information you have to wade through reams of useless stuff with little guidance on how to distinguish between the two The basic reality of an all news channel after all is that there is a huge amount of time to fill every single day As a result CNBC and CNNfn both offer a hodgepodge of fundamental analysis technical analysis macroeconomic news trend spotters and the occasional hard news story A day spent watching CNBC is an object lesson in what the word pastiche really means From one angle of course this might seem to be the ideal expression of the supermarket approach to understanding the world or in this case the stock market CNBC doesn t offer just one angle on the market It offers multiple perspectives in order to let viewers choose for themselves I ll have two pounds of technical analysis one pound of momentum trading and a half pound of fundamentals Thanks So first we get a technical analyst who believes that if you look at the charts of a stock s movements over the past year you can discern coherent patterns that will guide you in predicting when that stock s price is due to rise or fall That analyst is followed by another who believes that the key is to seek out and buy those industries currently in favor with investors She in turn is followed by an advocate for a more conventional approach looking for companies with strong earnings growth that are currently trading at low stock prices The problem here is not that the technical analyst is crazy although he is The problem is that these analyses of the market are presented as if they re all of equal value when in truth for any one to be correct the others with some minor exceptions must be incorrect The network interviewer often the same one talking to these various analysts never says Your argument directly contradicts the one we heard just 15 minutes ago Why should we believe you Instead there s just a lot of nodding in assent One way of averting this problem would be for CNBC or CNNfn to feature discussions among advocates of different approaches to understanding the market But that sort of open conflict would run the risk of revealing the inherently futile nature of the project these networks are engaged in namely trying to make sense of the stock market s movement in the short term Each day after all there are lots of different reasons why the market does what it does But you ll never be able to summarize them all and more importantly whatever reasons you find today aren t going to help you understand what the market will do tomorrow In the short term investing is really just a random walk What s really wrong with the financial news boom then is that by creating the illusion that the walk is other than random it depends upon and encourages a trader s approach to investing The point of having a stock market after all is not so that people can buy Intel at 72 when it s on its way up and sell at 76 to reap a quick profit The point is that investors are supposed to direct capital toward companies that will make productive use of it and direct capital away from companies that will not Just as index fund investing defeats this purpose so too does trading based on anything other than an evaluation of a company s underlying prospects for the future That s why ideally CNBC would feature nothing but informative pieces on publicly traded companies with occasional glances at the overall economic climate Of course its ratings would soon be turned into hash marks Which might suggest that real business news is no more popular than it ever was
