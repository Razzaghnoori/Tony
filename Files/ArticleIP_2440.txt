 Privatize Marriage In the debate over whether to legalize gay marriage both sides are missing the point Why should the government be in the business of decreeing who can and cannot be married Proponents of gay marriage see it as a civil rights issue Opponents see it as another example of minority rights being imposed on the majority culture But why should anyone have or need to have state sanction for a private relationship As governments around the world contemplate the privatization of everything from electricity to Social Security why not privatize that most personal and intimate of institutions marriage Privatizing marriage can mean two slightly different things One is to take the state completely out of it If couples want to cement their relationship with a ceremony or ritual they are free to do so Religious institutions are free to sanction such relationships under any rules they choose A second meaning of privatizing marriage is to treat it like any other contract The state may be called upon to enforce it but the parties define the terms When children or large sums of money are involved an enforceable contract spelling out the parties respective rights and obligations is probably advisable But the existence and details of such an agreement should be up to the parties And privatizing marriage would incidentally solve the gay marriage problem It would put gay relationships on the same footing as straight ones without implying official government sanction No one s private life would have official government sanction which is how it should be Andrew Sullivan one of the leading advocates of gay marriage writes Marriage is a formal public institution that only the government can grant But the history of marriage and the state is more complicated than modern debaters imagine as one of its scholars Lawrence Stone writes In the early Middle Ages all that marriage implied in the eyes of the laity seems to have been a private contract between two families For those without property it was a private contract between two individuals enforced by the community sense of what was right By the 16 th century the formally witnessed contract called the spousals was usually followed by the proclamation of the banns three times in church but the spousals itself was a legally binding contract Only with the Earl of Hardwicke s Marriage Act of 1754 did marriage in England come to be regulated by law In the New England colonies marriages were performed by justices of the peace or other magistrates from the beginning But even then common law unions were valid In the 20 th century however government has intruded upon the marriage contract among many others Each state has tended to promulgate a standard one size fits all formula Then in the past generation legislatures and courts have started unilaterally changing the terms of the marriage contract Between 1969 and 1985 all the states provided for no fault divorce The new arrangements applied not just to couples embarking on matrimony but also to couples who had married under an earlier set of rules Many people felt a sense of liberation the changes allowed them to get out of unpleasant marriages without the often contrived allegations of fault previously required for divorce But some people were hurt by the new rules especially women who had understood marriage as a partnership in which one partner would earn money and the other would forsake a career in order to specialize in homemaking Privatization of religion better known as the separation of church and state was our founders prescription for avoiding Europe s religious wars Americans may think each other headed for hell but we keep our religious views at the level of private proselytizing and don t fight to impose one religion by force of law Other social conflicts can likewise be depoliticized and somewhat defused if we keep them out of the realm of government If all arts funding were private as 99 percent of it already is for instance we wouldn t have members of Congress debating Robert Mapplethorpe s photographs or the film The Watermelon Woman So why not privatize marriage Make it a private contract between two individuals If they wanted to contract for a traditional breadwinner homemaker setup with specified rules for property and alimony in the event of divorce they could do so Less traditional couples could keep their assets separate and agree to share specified expenses Those with assets to protect could sign prenuptial agreements that courts would respect Marriage contracts could be as individually tailored as other contracts are in our diverse capitalist world For those who wanted a standard one size fits all contract that would still be easy to obtain Wal Mart could sell books of marriage forms next to the standard rental forms Couples would then be spared the surprise discovery that outsiders had changed their contract without warning Individual churches synagogues and temples could make their own rules about which marriages they would bless And what of gay marriage Privatization of the institution would allow gay people to marry the way other people do individually privately contractually with whatever ceremony they might choose in the presence of family friends or God Gay people are already holding such ceremonies of course but their contracts are not always recognized by the courts and do not qualify them for the 1049 federal laws that the General Accounting Office says recognize marital status Under a privatized system of marriage courts and government agencies would recognize any couple s contract or better yet eliminate whatever government created distinction turned on whether a person was married or not Marriage is an important institution The modern mistake is to think that important things must be planned sponsored reviewed or licensed by the government The two sides in the debate over gay marriage share an assumption that is essentially collectivist Instead of accepting either view let s get the government out of marriage and allow individuals to make their own marriage contracts as befits a secular individualist republic at the dawn of the information age
