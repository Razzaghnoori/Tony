Leonardo DiCaprio and two flamboyant guy pals were recently spotted perusing the sheets and towels at Los Angeles Beverly Center After poring over dozens of colors and styles Tilton reports the fussy fellas finally agreed on over 8 000 worth of luxury linens and a dreamy down filled comforter and duvet cover for Leo s master bedroom The Star meanwhile maintains that Jerry Seinfeld s new fiancee
