 well how do you feel about it well uh i don t have any strong convictions about it that s for sure um i know i haven t done any Peace Corps service and i don t know anybody in my immediate family that has or you know has ever even thought about it do you know uh do you know anybody that s been it no the the only people i know that have done anything remotely like that are people that have gone to be missionaries and that s only because i went to Baylor and a lot of students from Baylor go and and serve as missionaries during the summer but i think i think that s a terrible idea that s like forcing someone to donate to a charity yeah i mean it it s nice to to try to teach young people some some uh uh civil uh consciousness but forcing them to to donate basically their time and efforts yeah it s definitely up to the person uh so i d have to say that uh it you know the people who do it well some feel it s rewarding i don t know you know but uh i don t know how we got the subject you know i have nothing to say about this it it i don t either i don t either i was i almost hung up because i thought well gosh i don t i don t really have an opinion except for no i think that s dumb um hum well how long you been in San Antonio but uh i ve been here for um just uh almost five years well no almost four years okay and i lived with Dana in school okay that s how we know each other and uh you you were just up there then huh uh huh last weekend we went to Six Flags Saturday uh oh okay yeah a good old time well that s good well back to the topic at hand what other types of community service would they be talking about i mean the the recording mentioned the Peace Corps well it sounded like i mean this is like major long term commitment like a year or six months or yeah so you re looking at the Peace Corps or sabbatical maybe or you know i don t know i mean but uh i mean i m all for donating my time to worthy causes like i do some volunteer work here and there and every once in a while i ll do uh a uh local Big Brother Big Sister thing um hum or i ll go you know do a but that that time is minuscule compared to what what it sound like they were referring to yeah yeah i i couldn t possibly commit a year or two of my life to to go do something yeah yeah they couldn t cover my hourly rate i couldn t afford it no kidding but uh i have this thing against bugs too and seems to me like the Peace Corps they send you someplace that there s a lot of bugs yeah Africa a lot of yeah have to live in a shack with no air conditioning and no medicine and no anything i d probably catch a terrible disease and die yeah well i doubt that but you know i guess well i i mean it would it would have to be tough going somewhere you don t know the culture usually i guess i think that maybe that s why some people do it is yeah uh to see the other cultures or you know and some of that but um hum uh to do that i don t know i d have to be i don t know oh i don t know either the other growing up all i knew was oh you go to high school you you know you work you go to college you get out of college and you get a good job and you work and and none of this you go spend two years in the Peace Corps to expand to broaden your horizons um hum well you know uh i know American Express i m now i m working at American Express now and they uh huh after a certain amount of years of service these employees can take off like six months or something for some type of sabbatical or some you know some something like that uh huh and they re allowed to take that time off and then come back where they left off oh so it is something that i think uh you know even the larger organizations will support uh it s really it s really for the community to give you know to to give back to the community type of thing i m for i don t know pretty it s for yeah i think at the same time it s for some people to you know help them grow in other areas kind of like joining the military well i mean in that respect a lot of people join the military to to grow up yeah maybe and to decide what they want to do and the Peace Corps or something like that is probably useful as as that kind of a time yeah maybe a little bit in that perspective but uh i know a lot of people that have gone in the military i mean in you know when they re in the college sometimes it s to support help support college you know the money um hum uh others people don t know what they want to do but as far as uh you know the Peace Corps i guess i suppose there s a few people that have done it at that point in their lives but i think a lot of it s you know when the people get older they ll do something like that i d probably have a different perspective if i actually knew someone that had gone into the Peace Corps yeah i i i don t but i don t and none of my didn t mean to cut you off there oh that s okay none and none of my really close friends in college went off to be missionaries or anything so i don t really know anyone first hand that s that s committed committed a chunk of their life to do service work everybody i know has been well i m going to go get a job good job and make some money and buy a nice car uh i know so or try or try to make a living yeah but uh yeah i i have no i don t know anybody that s that done that either so i it s it s interesting we got this topic because i i i don t know what i marked off to get this but i certainly didn t mark off anything to get this one i can t i can t imagine and the switchboard s been down for several days and the last time i called it before it went down i had this topic and i didn t feel like talking about it so i hung up and i guess they they keep you on the same topic until you actually talk to somebody about it so you had the same one huh yeah oh well well you you ll get it over with here i know it how many times have you talked oh probably five or six yeah not a whole lot oh i ve done maybe four or five yeah did Dana sign you up for this well she just sent me the information out i i got a hold of it you know i just sent it back in and yeah that s she stuck my name on some list so they mailed me the information that i filled out what other topics have you had well that s pretty um i ve talked about camping with someone i ve talked about the weather great great that one was interesting because i talked to a man in in Washington DC and it was hot here and it was snowing there so that was pretty interesting um hum and i talked to someone about the uh the uh education system i forget exactly what the focus was on that one but that was fairly interesting and i ve talked to somebody about credit card usage yeah and and i talked to this person who i gathered from speaking to her that that she and her family just didn t have much and they didn t have much credit available to them um hum and so she basically didn t use credit cards and didn t know very much about them and how they work and and how you can use them to your advantage and and how you know you hm yeah i always you can do certain things with them i use everything with my Visa and i pay it all off so that s a good deal for me i get free money for thirty days so yeah yeah that s the way i use them uh i try i try to make sure i don t get in debt so yeah yeah well that s always a good plan i can t think of anything else that i ve talked about all the the most most of the ones on the list i checked off stuff like football and and stuff that i can i i would enjoy talking about and i haven t gotten a one of them yet when i ve called i had uh let s see i ve had fishing and uh i can t remember me and i think me and Dana had football yeah we did oh how funny yeah uh we so we talked about the Cowboys a little bit and i m out here in Phoenix so we talked about Phoenix Cardinals and um hum so so that one was all right and then what else i had i think i had some other uh like staying in shape or working out this other guy i got this guy from New York so i had to talk to someone about hobbies and the switchboard called me so i was caught a little off guard and i couldn t think of anything at all so i started making stuff up i told this woman that my hobby was gardening and i can t even i can t even grow an ivy my grandfather gave me a plant once that told and he told me when he gave it to me that it was impossible to kill you could freeze it you could and you ve probably never gardened in your life you could dry it out no matter what you couldn t kill it well i killed it pretty quick yeah i don t i don t have too much of a green thumb either so i do have one plant here it s been hanging out for a while but i think it s one of your easiest plants i can t i don t know the name of it but i m not too much into
