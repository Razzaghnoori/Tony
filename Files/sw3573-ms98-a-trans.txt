                okay well   there we are   all right um um well uh tell me about the car that youve got     well i have a Honda um hatchback nineteen eighty four   and uhhuh   and i had a hatchback a nineteen seventy eight version before this one   uhhuh   and uh ill be honest with you i have never found any automobile that has been more conscientiously constructed and and uh put together and it it does its job all i have to do on my Honda is change the oil and the filter every thirty five hundred miles and i i did have to put two front two new front tires on at fifty thousand miles but that car just purrs like the day it was built i get forty two miles per gallon on the highway and right between twenty eight to thirty driving around in town its a uh five speed straight stick machine   umhum   and i can carry more in that uh that trunk area in my little Honda than i can in the big cars and i have a large um Pontiac and i have a sixty nine Cougar which really is im saving because its its old but its in beautiful shape   umhum   but i can carry as much in my Honda or more than i can in in those other bigger cars   well thats very interesting ive had ive had exactly the same experience with the one that ive got its a and surprisingly its also an eighty four   oh     and um   LX   yeah im still there um im sorry what   it was an LX   yes its an LX its not a hatchback but its um its uh   uhhuh yours is a four door   four door yeah and very very comfortable car big roomy trunk uh and uh and very happy with it and i must admit its you know if if if uh   umhum yeah   yeah my only consideration were were you know buying another car just to tool around town and and make you know brief trips and things like that i i would very very seriously consider buying one uh i think theyre extraordinarily reliable cars um my my real concern with with uh   yes we are   uh why im not sure i i want to buy a Honda is because i have to make a kind of a a steady um trip down the road about once a month because im divorced and i have a daughter that lives down in North Carolina and uh   well hm     i drive down interstate ninety five and its just an absolutely wild highway   ninety five is wild in any car theres no doubt about that   yeah and   because i i i run over to Crystal City or used to im retiring the end of this month   uhhuh   but im very much aware of the crazy driving that goes on over there   and you well youve got it and uh so having precious cargo in the car with me as you can well imagine its very hard for me to imagine that that uh a Hondas going to be as safe a car as as the one that ive got got my eye on which is a Volvo   umhum umhum   in in fact  quite frankly ive owned a Volvo in the past and uh ive ive theyre expensive cars to keep up when they need service but uh   umhum   ive found that ive had a lot of luck with them uh course im a mechanically inclined kind of person and i always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that you know need to be taken care of and so forth and i guess thats one thing that that recommends the Honda to a lot of people is is theres just very little that you have to do under the hood and   yes it just just sits there and purrs and you all you got to do is the main major thing of changing that oil and that filter i get six hundred miles on a tank of gas   oh i know its really amazing   yeah beautiful beautiful machine   its absolutely incredible         so um yeah anyway ive been looking at the prices of these cars and and and so forth and i think that its its very surprising some of these very expensive Volvos can be gotten for a lot less money than you would think if youre willing to   is that right uhhuh   buy ones that are about the vintage of the the cars that you and i currently own     umhum   and um   well a brand new Volvo costs what thirty thousand dollars   well certainly some of the top end ones you can still get get uh even the the low end wagons um for less than twenty thousand dollars   uhhuh   and uh we get you know in the Washington area of course being as affluent as it is there are lots and lots of Volvo dealerships down here   um umhum   so therere lots and lots of them available in the paper at any any week and i sort of you know scan the paper and look at them and so forth and   yeah   so um  anyway and thats thats the other thing is that ive ive never really been too terribly much of a new car person i think ive bought one or two new cars in my life and ive tended to um to uh buy cars that are you know two or three and sometimes even four and five or six years old this Honda that i have i bought used and in fact it had an extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it ive just rolled seventy thousand miles and its a seventy four i mean an eighty four so   well my my eighty eighty four just has seventy seven on it     yeah   and ive made many trips to Washington and down to Virginia Beach Virginia where my mother lives and things like that and i drive it
