 so what kind of camping do you like well we uh as a little girl i used to go camping with my family and uh we d load up our car and take tents and cots and all kinds of stuff and the place that we went the most often was uh in Oklahoma it s about a two or three hour drive and it is a little bitty national park right in the right in a town called Sulphur Oklahoma and it was real pretty had lots of trees and creeks to play in and it was a lot of fun so you like that more civilized kind of camping you got cots yeah probably so yeah well i m i m sort of a rough and ready camper i ll uh uh huh whatever i can carry on a backpack oh is is what i go with yeah um when i was in the Air Force i used to be up in South Dakota uh huh and there were some really nice places up in the Black Hills to go camping uh huh and i had this really nice place you had to uh drive in as far as i could and then park and then you had to walk in the rest of the way uh huh but it was across a little stream and it was sort of um uh not a big area but there was a perfectly round stand of trees uh huh and it had a nice little area inside that course it gave you shelter and everything yeah and it was right next to a nice cold stream huh so it was my favorite place uh huh and probably the worse thing that ever happened was around March the weather starts getting funny it will be warm one day and freezing the next yeah so but that s also about the time you start getting cabin fever yeah well i had cabin fever really bad so i loaded up the car and took off and i got up there and got camped or got got my camp setup uh huh and that night it got down to seventeen below and started snowing oh my goodness yeah did you have uh very warm sleeping bag or oh i had i had a nice sleeping bag i also had uh uh catalytic heater oh my goodness um but i woke up and the snow was halfway up the the front of the tent i m going oh no i go out i had all my stuff set i had my little campfire thing setup and my my pots and pans and stove and all that oh yeah and i get everything s buried under snow so i m out there digging around so i think well to hell with it you know i ll go i ll go play around for a while well there s this fallen tree across the stream and these streams of course are felt fed by melted snow so they re cold anyway uh huh yeah oh yeah so here i am going across this snow encrusted log oh no and i slipped and fell in oh no and crashed through the ice right up to my neck in freezing cold weather i could just feel my heart going oh oh oh no uh how did you get out of that well fortunately i had the presence of mind when i slipped i just i just went with it i didn t try to twist or anything uh huh and as i went i just turned and stuck my arms out and i hit the hit the log with my arms uh huh and that pretty much saved me from going all the way under yeah um anyway i finally pulled myself out and i mean just as soon as i got out my clothes started freezing oh man oh that s awful yeah so i i trotted back to the car rather quickly uh jumped in went home and took a hot shower and changed clothes and went back oh my goodness oh that s quite an experience i probably would have had a heart attack and died right there on the spot it was i think i almost did that was something oh that i bet yeah i i enjoy camping i like getting out especially i don t i don t understand these people people take these camper trailers and stuff i mean that s that s not camping i mean that s like yeah yeah yeah that s just like moving to another area for a while yeah i mean here you are you got you know you got showers and stoves and refrigerators and TV s and air conditioning yeah yeah i mean good grief that s not camping i know it s kind of funny i like to rough it yeah well did you go camping by yourself then you didn t go with other people or no usually i went by myself it was sort of get away from everybody time huh yeah and you ve been locked up with folks all winter it s time to get away by yourself yeah yeah and it was so it was so nice up there that just i mean it was so quiet and peaceful yeah well that s nice yeah it s nice nice area yeah just a second uh when i uh planned my little uh schedule of when i could talk on the phone this one was suppose to be asleep and she s not cooperating yeah she fooled you yeah i think so uh i ve got three kitty cats and they were suppose to be taking a nap and oh one just crawled up in my lap and every time she hears me on the phone she s got to come sit in my lap yeah wants you to got to be got to be part of the action here my kids want a cat so bad and uh i d i d like to get them one but we live close to a busy street and almost everyone has a cat it s been hit run over maimed you know and i just can t stand the thought of it oh yeah all all mine are uh purebreds so i keep them in so yeah keep them in the house yeah especially well that may be our only option if we ever get one especially especially this one huh she s a mess huh aren t you kitty cat well this is real interesting that you re as far away as you are because i really thought this was uh uh we re sort of like TI exclusive yeah TI people yeah and so i just figured no it s just this area you know yeah well that s interesting have you had many calls well you re my third one and i have never gotten the courage to do it myself isn t that funny well i tell you it s it s easy to do it s just uh like when i started calling you it was two twenty my time one twenty your time i guess uh huh uh huh and however long it took however long we ve been on that s how long it took for some for the computer to find somebody for it to oh my yeah i ve been sitting here and sitting here and sitting here oh i never thought about that that it would take a long time to find someone available i didn t think it would take as long as it does but like last night when i made one uh huh the long that was the longest one i waited thirty five minutes oh my goodness and sometimes you ll get it on the first try i mean it s just yeah i guess it depends on the time of day too yeah this is not a real good time of day because most people listed their home numbers and of course they re gone yeah yeah but i ve got a class tonight so i wanted to get these out of the way yeah this is this is my thirtieth call oh wow yeah that s great well i got a catalog that you know shows all the gifts and things you can get and yeah uh huh i started getting inspired thinking oh we need to do this i d like to have a few of those things yeah the only reason i d do it is because i want to make sure that i get all my calls in before they they just up and pull the plug on the program you know yeah that s right and they probably will soon so yeah because being a student i m doing it for the money yeah yeah i can see that i want to make sure i m i m my roommate does it too huh well that s pretty neat yeah well it ll be a nice little bit of money we re going to yeah yeah every time i ve talked to one of them my husband said i can t believe that you made five dollars every time you do that it sounds easy so he signed up to do it but he s never done one so well of course there s this other one that i ve i ve talked to fairly regularly in Dallas um same thing her husband signed up for it and she s the one that does it i know yeah i know it s crazy but he ll spend the money i bet that s right yeah he ll say yeah i did that yeah we re going to take the money and get uh go out and find a nice stud for Himy Persian oh yeah she s a she s a beauty we re going to going to get a nice litter off of her well that will be neat yeah she s she s so sweet too oh i tell you my kids would love to they d just want any kind of a cat bless their hearts and like i said um i really would like to have one too because i know how much they want one It s just hard one my youngest daughter has asthma and uh been a little afraid to have a cat in the house all the time with a child that has asthma yeah so i thought well i need an outdoor cat but if i have an outdoor cat i m afraid it s going to get hurt so uh huh i have a problem yeah that s that s bit a problem i mean you could always buy a uh you could always buy a Sphinx yeah those are hairless cats of course they re huh i don t think they d be too fun oh they are they re they re loads of fun that s the most playful cat around are they huh but they on the other hand too they cost twenty five hundred dollars oh my land i d be scared to death to have anything that expensive yeah my my roomy wants to buy a a Sphinx huh and i keep saying no no no oh i ve never heard of that no yeah we both decided on a Devonrex though it s sort of like a Sphinx it s a very short haired cat huh it s almost like just fuzz huh but uh they re substantially cheaper yeah i would hope so we re we re into this breeding business pretty heavy now and he well that s good yeah as long as you don t lose sight that they re still kitty cats yeah yeah and they re fun to have around yeah i guess so this one here is just sweet oh that s neat she s kneading on my my stomach pushing and pushing and drooling quit drooling on me look at this i m wet well it was nice talking to you i think i m going to have to catch my daughter before she eats any more candy when i m on the phone that s her sign that she can do what she wants to do oh that s it all right it was good talking to you yeah you too talk to you later Janet bye bye okay thanks good bye
