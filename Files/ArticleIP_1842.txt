 Francis Ford Coppola Every couple of years Francis Ford Coppola s devoted fans and such people still exist do something heartbreaking They see his new film This month has brought the latest Coppola punishment The Rainmaker Or rather John Grisham s The Rainmaker a title that tells you everything you need to know about the movie Critics are greeting Coppola s film the usual Grisham tale of an idealistic young lawyer slingshotting a Goliath with a desperate generosity Casting about for something nice to say most reviewers have hit upon the conclusion that J G s The Rainmaker is better than the typical Hollywood movie by which they mean it has fewer automatic weapons fewer car chases and more character actors than regular fare does One well meaning critic called it the best Grisham movie since The Firm This is sad Francis Ford Coppola the director of The Godfather The Godfather Part II The Conversation Rumble Fish and Apocalypse Now and the winner of five Academy Awards is being praised for making the second best John Grisham movie What s even sadder The Rainmaker is actually much better than most of Coppola s recent work In the past 15 years he s become the most hackish of the studio hacks His last dozen films have ranged from bombastic dreck Bram Stoker s Dracula The Godfather Part III The Cotton Club to infantile dreck Jack Captain Eo to biographical dreck Tucker The Man and His Dream to pretentious dreck One From the Heart New York Stories He has also been producer for an astonishing volume of bad cinema and television including NBC s The Odyssey the 1992 movie Wind and White Dwarf a sci fi movie for Fox Despite this record of unadulterated mediocrity a fog of optimism continues to envelop Coppola Rainmaker reviewers are saying the same thing about Coppola that they said when Jack opened in 1996 when The Godfather Part III opened in 1990 when Tucker opened in 1988 He s ready to make his comeback This movie it is promised will be Coppola s last as a studio lackey Soon he will return with his own project independent of Hollywood s morons and make the great movie that They have stopped him from making since the late 70s Coppola is cryptic about what this project will be but there are vague rumors about Megalopolis a long planned film comparing Imperial Rome and modern Manhattan Other rumors have him filming Jack Kerouac s On the Road The optimists are sure to be disappointed they misdiagnose the cause of Coppola s illness People continue to believe in Coppola because he is the romantic archetype of the movie director He has embedded himself in the mythology of the film industry like no director since Orson Welles or D W Griffith Coppola made his name as the director who would risk everything his fortune his family even his sanity for his art During the 70s and the 80s Coppola bucked Hollywood by opening his own studio American Zoetrope It was a doomed enterprise but a noble one For a few years Coppola did free himself and his prot g s from Hollywood s thrall In the late 70s he cemented his reputation as an Artist with Apocalypse Now He gave himself a nervous breakdown gave Martin Sheen a heart attack and spent 16 million of his own money to complete the picture His Apocalypse Now lunacy is brilliantly chronicled in the documentary Hearts of Darkness In the early 80s Coppola drove himself into bankruptcy again for One From the Heart his beloved musical romance He made a black and white movie for kids Rumble Fish Coppola has made more actors into stars than any 10 other directors combined and he has pioneered technology notably video editing that other filmmakers have come to rely on In person Coppola is expansive generous a brilliant talker a salesman He is in short the very model of what a movie maker should be This vision of Coppola as romantic genius makes it very easy to rationalize his failures as poor accountancy His career can be summed up as the case of a man who needed a financial manager says Roger Ebert Coppola spent much of the 80s in bankruptcy driven there by the failure of One From the Heart and his studio s collapse So of course he became a hired gun He needed to pay his debts According to the mythology Coppola was given third rate scripts and managed to transform them into second rate entertainment like The Cotton Club Gardens of Stone and Peggy Sue Got Married Coppola who had been notorious for delivering his own movies late and over budget earned a reputation as a reliable director He stuck to his budgets and almost all his studio movies even the reprehensible Jack earned money Coppola too buys into the notion that he would have kept making great movies if only he d been debt free He s obsessed with the notion of artistic purity The Rainmaker is a two hour tribute to the idea of not selling out Click on the graphic to see the movie s emotional climax when the young lawyer hero confronts the old lawyer villain about selling out In recent interviews Coppola has upbraided himself for his own But Coppola may be misjudging the reason why he s made so many bad movies He thinks that selling out making movies for financial rather than artistic reasons has put a crimp in his style But he has always been a sellout Or to put it more kindly the quality of his movies has never depended on whether the movies were sellouts or not Some of Coppola s personal movies are magnificent The Conversation and arguably Apocalypse Now But others are dreadful One From the Heart Tucker Some of Coppola s sellout movies are dreadful The Cotton Club Jack But Coppola s two greatest movies the Godfather s were studio funded studio managed projects The Godfather in fact was the quintessential sellout Paramount picked Coppola to direct the movie because he would work for cheap Why would he work for cheap Because he had just bankrupted himself making a disastrous independent movie called The Rain People Coppola has become a studio hack for much more banal reasons He got older mellower more respectable He has his estates his winery his Belize resort his merchandise It s impossible to imagine today s Coppola driving himself or his actors the way he did during the filming of Apocalypse Now He also seems to lack the inspiration for a grand project His last truly personal movies were Tucker back in 1988 and One From the Heart back in 1982 Neither was good Recently Coppola said People want me so badly to do something truly astounding To show them something they haven t seen before I would like to do that and I really believe I can do it This may be the heart of Coppola s dilemma He views his life as a story of unfulfilled promise the tale of an artist constrained by commerce It isn t Coppola s life is the story of fulfilled promise He made two of the greatest if not the two greatest movies in American history These were triumphs enough for any career It is Coppola s tragedy that he believes his best work is always ahead of him yet keeps on making Rainmaker s
