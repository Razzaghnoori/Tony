 Beating Around the Bush Everything you need to know about Gov George W Bush R Texas you learned in kindergarten Launching his presidential campaign in Iowa this weekend Bush outlined a threefold agenda to impose bad consequences for bad behavior and love our neighbor as we want to be loved ourselves to help churches and charities to nurture to mentor to comfort people in need and to insist that every child must be educated A less daring platform can scarcely be imagined Yet the media lauded Bush s speech for its boldness citing the contrasts he drew with President Clinton while appealing to a different kind of audience from the one that had elected his father and distinguishing himself from the rest of the crowded Republican field How does Bush pass off his clich s as confrontations By fabricating illusory distinctions and debates 1 Compassionate conservatism This is Bush s unofficial slogan Saturday in Iowa Rep Jim Leach R Iowa introduced Bush as a conservative with a conscience with compassion Bush used the word compassion 13 times in his speech concluding I know this approach has been criticized But why Is compassion beneath us Is mercy below us Should our party be led by someone who boasts of a hard heart I m proud to be a compassionate conservative I welcome the label And on this ground I will make my stand The crowd applauded and the press swooned As the Los Angeles Times described the scene Taking up a challenge from some opponents Bush defended his philosophy of compassionate conservatism How does Bush spin compassion the world s most universal value as a courageous stand As with most magic tricks the sleight of hand occurs at the outset when Bush says his philosophy has been criticized In truth none of Bush s rivals has criticized compassion or boasted of a hard heart On the contrary some call compassionate conservatism an offensive phrase because it suggests that unmodified conservatives lack compassion just as many liberals complained that Vice President Al Gore s practical idealism implied that unmodified idealists were impractical Others dismiss this phrase as weasel words designed to substitute for positions on specific issues What Bush s opponents have criticized in short is not his approach but its redundancy and insubstantiality By conning the media into reporting that he was defending his philosophy Bush snuffed out the real question whether he has a philosophy to defend 2 Prosperity with a purpose This is Bush s official campaign theme It s supposed to convey what he offers that Gore doesn t Clinton and Gore may have brought us prosperity the slogan suggests but Bush will give our prosperity a purpose And what is that purpose According to Bush America must be prosperous so that anybody who wants to work can find a high quality high paying job America must be prosperous so that people can realize their entrepreneurial dreams America must be open so that every citizen knows the promise of America America must be educated so that all our citizens can realize the American dream In other words the purpose of prosperity is prosperity 3 The responsibility era Bush doesn t talk about moral issues that might get him into trouble such as abortion or homosexuality Instead he pledges to usher in the responsibility era in which we will confront illegitimacy instill discipline and love in juvenile justice and accept that we re responsible for our neighbors and helping in our communities Lest anyone point out the abstractness and obviousness of these commitments Bush says they stand in stark contrast to the last few decades when our culture has clearly said If it feels good do it and if you ve got a problem blame somebody else Does Bush really think the last few decades supervised in large part by his father and President Reagan were the era of irresponsibility Or is he painting a dark background to lend the illusion of luster to his pale moral agenda Likewise Bush often uses sharp language to obscure fuzzy thought Some people think it is inappropriate to draw a moral line in the sand Not me he proclaims And what is his line Children must learn to say yes to responsibility yes to hard work yes to honesty and yes to family Likewise Bush asserts We must teach our children there are wrong choices Such as Drugs alcohol and teen pregnancy he says And what s wrong with teen pregnancy It s a sure fire way to fall behind he explains using the language not of a pulpit but of a Planned Parenthood clinic 4 New idealism In Iowa Bush elicited applause and media excitement by taking what the Los Angeles Times called several shots at Clinton I will not use my office as a mirror to reflect public opinion declared Bush Government should not try to be all things to all people I do not run polls to tell me what to think We will show that politics after a time of tarnished ideals can be higher and better We will give our country a fresh start after a season of cynicism Americans are waiting for new hopes new energy and new idealism The difference between an idealist and a cynic in this view is that the idealist is willing to take a stand contrary to public opinion On taxes Bush proposes to give Americans more money in the name of compassion On special interest pork He told Iowans he supports ethanol subsidies On Kosovo He welcomes the peace agreement but says America should be suspicious of it On the GOP s campaign against James Hormel the gay man Clinton has appointed to be ambassador to Luxembourg Bush says that any qualified appointee should be allowed to serve but that he won t speak out against the campaign because Hormel isn t conservative On fiscal restraint Bush says A fter we meet priorities when we have money left over we must pass it back to the taxpayers Note the caveat about priorities Sound familiar Like his father Bush substitutes virtue for substance When asked by Newsweek what his family stands for George W answered Honesty integrity serving for the right reasons And what are those reasons America and what America stands for he replied To bring integrity and decency to the process and to serve for the right reason which is country above self But I m going to have a specific agenda that addresses what I think are the big concerns as we go into the 21 st century The younger Bush s constant assurances that he s going to unveil his 10 point plans and specific incentives any day now a vague pledge to be specific are the functional equivalent of his father s constant allusions to vision The less you have of something the more you boast of it abstractly 5 A uniter not a divider Bush s greatest feat has been to spin his evasion of controversies as a virtue A leader must be a uniter not a divider he declares This country is hungry for a new style campaign that is positive hopeful inclusive and unites America With those words the Republican front runner takes a bold stand against taking bold stands Shame on lesser candidates who demand that he choose sides on the difficult issues of the day He s in his own league And by selling the media distinctions without a difference he intends to keep it that way
