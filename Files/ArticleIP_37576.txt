                                  My Fathers Estate            A letter from an illmannered former highschoolclassmate of long ago one of several like it which I pass on in paraphraseI saw that your father had died she wrote He was always so clever aboutmoney Did he leave you a big estate Did he figure out a way around the estatetax Its a rude question but it has an answer            My sister and I have been going through my fathersestate lately with his lawyer and were pawing through old dusty files tofind bank account numbers and rules for annuities so maybe its a good time tothink about what my father Herbert Stein left to us            He did indeed leave somemoney By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal orSports Illustrated  it was not worthy of much ink In any event becauseof the classwarfarebased death tax the amount that will be left is vastlyless than what he had saved As an economist my father was famous fordefending taxes as a necessary evil But even he was staggered not long beforehis death when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to theInternal Revenue Service            The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate ofabout  percent after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxedat around  percent and all that after paying estate expenses When I thinkabout it I want to cry My father and mother lived frugally all their livesThey never had a luxury car They never flew firstclass unless it was on theexpense account They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacationWhen he last went into the hospital my father was still wearing an old pair ofgray wool slacks with a sewedup hole in them from where my dog ripped themyears ago            They never had livein help My father washed thedishes after my mother made the meatloaf My father took the bus whenever hecould His only large expenditure in his and my moms whole lives was to payfor schools for his children and grandchildren He never bought bottledimported water he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for himThey still used bargainbasement furniture from before the war for theirbedroom furniture and their couch I never once knew them to order the mostexpensive thing in a restaurant and they always took the leftovers home            They made not one pennyof it from stock options or golden parachutes They made it all by deprivingthemselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs ofposterity To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue willprimarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it Theonly possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people whowere less selfdisciplined            There are a few material tangible items that an assessorwill have to come in to appraise There are my fathers books from his days atWilliams College and the University of Chicago many of them still neatlyunderlined and annotated in his handwriting which did not change from until days before his death Most of them are about economics but some arepoetry            Thats another item my father left his own poetryand his massive prose writings Very little of it is about anything at allabstruse There are no formulas and no graphs or charts except from his verylast years There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when shedied about how much he loved the sights of Washington about how dismaying itwas that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics Andthere are his satires of haiku about public policy his takeoffs on Wordsworthand Shakespeare often composed for a friends birthday then sometimes laterpublished I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father washardly a writer for the large audience            Some of them will go tothe Nixon Library and some will be on bookshelves in the very small andmodest house my wife and I own in Malibu a place he found beguiling becausehe had always wanted to live by the ocean and write And there are hisfurniture and his clothes none of which has any value at all except to mebecause they remind me of him and because when I stand near them in hiscloset I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes thecloset smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation inschools And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon his White Housecufflinks photos of Camp David certificates and honorary degrees andclippings of great events of state And there are his love letters to and frommy mother when they were courting in  and  still tied with light blueribbon in what was my mothers lingerie drawer talking about their lovetriumphing over the dangers of the Depression I suppose well have to place avalue on these and have them taxed too            But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sisterThe really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax The mans legacyto his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised indollars and cents            The example of loyalty and principle When he hadjust taken over as the chairman of President Nixons Council of EconomicAdvisers he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman brother of DustinHoffman Almost immediately John Dean then White House counsel came to seemy father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman Apparently Ron Hoffman hadsigned a public antiwar letter The FBI or whoever said that showed he wasnot loyal and not qualified My father said that this was a free country thatRon Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN and thathe would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policyAfter much worrying Hoffman was allowed to stayand performed well            My father was loyal and the IRS cannot impound thatlegacy When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of  most ofwhich were unearned and a chunk of which was earned my father never thought ofdisavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon Even though he had anappointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket Pop several timesextended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles overinflation and recession and never once publicly said a word against Nixon            Long after when Nixon was blasted as anantiSemite my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew kindconcerned about all on his staff regardless of ethnicity proIsraelproJewish in every important cause My father would never turn his back on aman who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to theStein family as RN had been            Loyalty There is noitem for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed            My father lived his life especially in the latter years ofit in a haze of appreciation Whatever small faults he could and did find withAmerica he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement ofmankind was America whose current failings were trivial by historic standardswhich was in a constant process of amelioration and which offered its citizensthe best chance in history for a good life            When he did consider the failures of American lifein the past especially institutionalized racism he did so to note theastonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime He had no use forthose who held up a mirror of faultfinding from the left or the right when hecould see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made forblacks Jews women Asians Hispanics and every other minority            He appreciated art especially ballet and opera Hesat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo andJuliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca  He lived to go to theKennedy Center to see great ballet or opera and he talked of it endlessly Buthe also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federalbuildings of the statues of Bolvar and George Washington and San Martin Heappreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of theCosmos Club He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and ofthe rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains Va insummer            This quality ofgratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed at least notso far            He appreciated his friends and did not differentiatebetween them on the basis of fame or position He took the words of hislongtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute a think tankwhere he hung his hat for many years into account and the words of MrsWiggins who ran the cafeteria at the AEI and the thoughts of Alan Greenspanor the head of Goldman Sachs and valued them entirely on their merits to himnot on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had He never once inmy lifetimes recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect forrichesin fact like Adam Smith he believed that the pleadings of the richmerited special suspicion He did not believe that my sister or I should devoteour lives to the pursuit of money and by his life set an example to us ofpursuing only what was interesting and challenging not what paid the most Inever knew him to chase a deal or a job he never in his whole life applied fora job for any other reason except that it was of interest to him He derivedmore pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Clubabout John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations thatpaid him handsomely            My fathers stance against seeking money for its ownsakeso wildly unsuited to todays age but so reassuring to hischildrencannot be taken by the Treasury            Pop had a way of putting what I thought of ascatastrophes into their rightful context If I was hysterical about losing somescriptwriting job my father would brush it aside as a basic risk part of thelife I had chosen If my stocks went down even dramatically my father wouldexplain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat I was far farahead of the game Most reassuring my father would tell me that my family andI could always come to Washington DC and live quietly keeping him companyfor which not a lot of money was required My father lived on a fraction ofthe income from his savings even allowing for paying for his grandchildrenseducation            Once about  years ago when my boss treated meunfairly my father said that if it happened again I should quit and he wouldtake care of me until I found a job I never needed to do it but the offerhung in my mind as a last refuge forever            This reassurancethatsomehow things will be all right that there is a lot of ruin in a man as wellas in a nation to paraphrase his idol Adam Smithhas become part of me andI can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly taxpayment due or a bad day on the market Again the IRS taxes it at zero            My father himself as far as I know inherited no money atall from his father He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve mostproblems that spending beyond ones means was a recipe for disaster thatflashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish Hedid inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he wouldnever live in was probably a bad mistake He rarely spoke in moral absolutesHe believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices butthat there were surely consequences to those choices that could be consideredHe passed these beliefs on to me although they have become somewhat attenuatedby my plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood Still I am one of the onlymen I know here who has never been drastically short of money so far andthat I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence            Most of all my father believed in loving andappreciating those persons close to him He stayed close to all his pals fromthe Nixon days and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan who hadbeen a friend and colleague although he was bewildered by Pats stands on manyissues He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friendsat the American Enterprise Institute which he thought of as one of his threehomesthe Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but wellsituated apartment atthe Watergate were the others            He could formattachments readily Even in his last days in the hospital he took a liking toa Ukrainianborn doctor and used to refer to him as Suvorov after theRussian general written of glowingly in War and Peace which still sitson the table next to his reading chair with his notes on little pieces ofpaper in it            He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in  andnever really got over the loss of a soul mate of  years who literallydreamed the same dreams he did Once he wrote my mother a poem which hecalled Route  about the beauty of Route  north of Charlottesville Vaand the pleasure of riding along it with my mom He filed it away for furtherwork and never touched it again The day after my mothers death he founditwith her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills andthose clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop She had written herpoem which she titled Only You and put it back in the file without evertelling him He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widowwhom he also came to appreciate and live for He probably spent more timetrying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financialfeature of his own life A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in herkitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete            Even in his hospital bed hearing my sons voice onthe phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain He sounds sosweet when he calls me Grandpa  my father said beaming even with tubes inhim            Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for helpthat he hesitated let alone declined to give Usually this was some researchwe were too lazy to do but which he did without any resistance at all When Iwas a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didnt want to do hissimple answer was to say Lets do it together Itll take half as long Iuse that with my son almost every day along with the devotion and my fathersexample about his friends from long ago to make my life work He stayed closewith friends from Williams College Class of  especially Richard Helms ofthe CIA He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams Johnny Davis classof  who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi days before he wentinto the hospital            This quality of devotionand the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in myfathers estateand cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of  percentPlus I can pass it on to my son without any generationskipping surcharge            And he left something else of perhaps even greater value agood name Many people quarreled with my fathers ideas about taxes or aboutwhen to balance the budget He faced frequent opposition to his belief in alarge defense budget Of course most of the people he knew disagreed with himabout RN But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly bymeans of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment but not for any venalreason or by the process of money changing hands His reputation for honestywas simply without a speck of question upon it            This good name cannot be taxed at all at least notright now My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keepit clean Its priceless incalculable in value            So in answer to the query from the forwardhighschool classmate Yes my father did leave an immense estate and yes hedid manage to beat the estate tax The only problem is that I miss him everysingle minute and I already had the best parts of the estate without his beinggone so the death part is pure loss
