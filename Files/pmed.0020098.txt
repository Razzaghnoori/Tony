 Michael Makover s Viewpoint We Should Use High Sensitivity Carotid Ultrasound to Detect Very Early Atherosclerosis and Treat Aggressively Atherosclerotic vascular disease is the greatest cause of death and disability in developed countries The best way to prevent these outcomes is to detect disease at the earliest possible stage and to attack it with pinpoint targeted aggressive treatment B mode ultrasonography of the carotid artery to measure the intima media thickness IMT Figure 1 is the most effective way to do that It is time to end the mindset that thinks of atherosclerosis as an inevitable function of aging It is not it is a disease whether it causes an acute event or gradual decline As with any disease the earlier and more intensively we attack it with medications and lifestyle changes the more successful we will be in containing and reversing it Ultrasonography of the carotid to detect plaque and increased intimal wall thickness is the best safest and easiest early detector we have Patients at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease are identifiable only up to a point using traditional methods including the Framingham risk score 1 the European SCORE Systemic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2 and the C reactive protein level 3 These are particularly effective for people in the highest risk groups but they have serious flaws They do not take family history of premature coronary artery disease into account they do not benefit from new assays that can differentiate lipoproteins by particle size and number both of which are important factors in atherogenicity and they do not include the quality of the patient s diet abdominal fat content racial and ethnic genetic differences confounding medical conditions certain gender differences and other factors Thus many patients deemed low risk for acute events within a period of time might still develop disease All of the current risk models were developed within the obsolete gestalt of life spans of perhaps 60 to 70 years whereas people are now increasingly living productively into their 80s and 90s Risk tables are based only on cardiac events over a relatively short time period of ten years Progress in medical science is now on the steepest slope of exponential growth It is reasonable to expect that those who maintain healthy circulation will experience good quality life beyond the 100 year mark in the surprisingly near future and perhaps to 120 years not long after Furthermore risk escalates with age Thus an initial low risk profile becomes far more significant when considered in the context of long lives Equally important gradual impairment of blood flow that nourishes tissues can lead to peripheral vascular disease increased susceptibility to infection cognitive decline frailty and other changes that impair life quality and longevity While risk factors help individualize treatment they do not address the most critical issue identifying atherosclerosis at the very earliest stage to try to stop and reverse the process before any damage has occurred Risk factors identify those who might develop disease The smoking gun is to identify disease when it actually first develops Atherosclerosis begins as a lipid and inflammatory cell deposition in the intimal subendothelial space which expands outward with only a slight inward intrusion on the lumen This does not affect blood flow unless the lumen side plaque cap ruptures and a clot forms and expands into the blood stream Most clots are limited by thrombolytic mechanisms but significant blockage usually results as the clot is scarred over Some clots expand all the way across to the other side of the artery completely occluding it causing a heart attack or stroke 4 Thus if we could discover plaque at the very earliest stage we could aggressively attack it with our full armamentarium of lifestyle modification addressing all the factors noted above and medications statins ACE inhibitors aspirin niacin ezetimibe and others to stabilize and then reverse the process before a rupture occurs The REVERSAL trial among many others has shown that atherosclerosis is reversible with aggressive treatment 5 Carotid ultrasound is an easy safe noninvasive method for detecting early focal plaques and early thickening of the inner lining of the artery 6 There is ample evidence that this is an effective and reproducible detector and a predictor of progression and symptomatic disease 7 In contrast angiography is invasive and is insensitive to early changes in the artery wall thickness Magnetic resonance imaging is expensive cumbersome and still experimental Calcium scoring by computed tomography is less sensitive and less reproducible and suggests plaque presence only indirectly 8 Angiography and calcium scoring entail considerable X ray exposure Using high sensitivity carotid ultrasound as a primary screening tool would add modest cost but that would be more than offset by sharply reducing the enormous worldwide toll of atherosclerosis Screening tests should be easy affordable widely available and predictive Carotid ultrasound meets all these criteria and should be used to screen everyone early on who is at any increased risk by measure of the expanded risk factors noted above Makover s Response to Ebrahim s Viewpoint While the population approach is obviously very important there is no reason not to use the high risk approach as well High risk is the wrong term all arteries matter over a 120 year life span We must attack atherosclerosis at the very onset not wait until it is high risk All previous approaches were designed to detect those at allegedly higher risk by various criteria This misses the point Once plaque exists risk exists especially when viewed over a full lifetime not the current ten year standard And although the aggressive approach I outlined in my viewpoint would obviously have a cost the savings a reduction in the financial toll of cardiovascular disease would be greater than the cost Ultrasonography of the carotid artery intimal wall is effective and highly predictive according to the great preponderance of studies 8 Ebrahim cites two studies to support his argument that measuring carotid IMT offers no additional predictive power over conventional screening tools 18 19 but the first of these has serious flaws such as a significant dropout rate that the authors assumed was random a short follow up period and the inclusion only of people of an advanced age 18 and the other concluded that carotid IMT measurement substantially improved prediction of future coronary heart disease 19 Millions of people are at risk now and cannot wait for endless studies to prove over and over what we already know It is not na ve for well people to want to remain well and to maintain their arteries to enable healthy older lives Nor should we disparage as worried the very human desire to remain that way Population wide planning is important but doctors take care of each patient as an individual Carotid ultrasonography is by far the best way to design treatment for every patient exactly as needed I believe that there is already sufficient evidence and sensible rationale to meld already well proven technologies and approaches into a comprehensive aggressive attack on atherosclerosis
