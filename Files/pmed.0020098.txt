                    Michael Makovers Viewpoint We Should Use HighSensitivity Carotid Ultrasound to        Detect Very Early Atherosclerosis and Treat Aggressively        Atherosclerotic vascular disease is the greatest cause of death and disability in        developed countries The best way to prevent these outcomes is to detect disease at the        earliest possible stage and to attack it with pinpointtargeted aggressive treatment        Bmode ultrasonography of the carotid artery to measure the intimamedia thickness IMT        Figure  is the most effective way to do that        It is time to end the mindset that thinks of atherosclerosis as an inevitable function        of aging It is not it is a disease whether it causes an acute event or gradual decline        As with any disease the earlier and more intensively we attack itwith medications and        lifestyle changesthe more successful we will be in containing and reversing it        Ultrasonography of the carotid to detect plaque and increased intimal wall thickness is the        best safest and easiest early detector we have        Patients at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease are identifiable only up to        a point using traditional methods including the Framingham risk score  the European        SCORE Systemic Coronary Risk Evaluation  and the Creactive protein level  These        are particularly effective for people in the highest risk groups but they have serious        flaws They do not take family history of premature coronary artery disease into account        they do not benefit from new assays that can differentiate lipoproteins by particle size        and number both of which are important factors in atherogenicity and they do not include        the quality of the patients diet abdominal fat content racial and ethnic genetic        differences confounding medical conditions certain gender differences and other factors        Thus many patients deemed low risk for acute events within a period of time might still        develop disease        All of the current risk models were developed within the obsolete gestalt of life spans        of perhaps  to  years whereas people are now increasingly living productively into        their s and s Risk tables are based only on cardiac events over a relatively short        time period of ten years Progress in medical science is now on the steepest slope of        exponential growth It is reasonable to expect that those who maintain healthy circulation        will experience good quality life beyond the year mark in the surprisingly near future        and perhaps to  years not long after Furthermore risk escalates with age Thus an        initial low risk profile becomes far more significant when considered in the context of        long lives Equally important gradual impairment of blood flow that nourishes tissues can        lead to peripheral vascular disease increased susceptibility to infection cognitive        decline frailty and other changes that impair life quality and longevity        While risk factors help individualize treatment they do not address the most critical        issue identifying atherosclerosis at the very earliest stage to try to stop and reverse        the process         before any damage has occurred Risk factors identify those who         might develop disease The smoking gun is to identify disease when it        actually first develops Atherosclerosis begins as a lipid and inflammatory cell deposition        in the intimal subendothelial space which expands outward with only a slight inward        intrusion on the lumen This does not affect blood flow unless the lumenside plaque cap        ruptures and a clot forms and expands into the blood stream Most clots are limited by        thrombolytic mechanisms but significant blockage usually results as the clot is scarred        over Some clots expand all the way across to the other side of the artery completely        occluding it causing a heart attack or stroke         Thus if we could discover plaque at the very earliest stage we could aggressively        attack it with our full armamentarium of lifestyle modification addressing all the factors        noted above and medicationsstatins ACE inhibitors aspirin niacin ezetimibe and        othersto stabilize and then reverse the process before a rupture occurs The REVERSAL        trial among many others has shown that atherosclerosis is reversible with aggressive        treatment  Carotid ultrasound is an easy safe noninvasive method for detecting early        focal plaques and early thickening of the inner lining of the artery  There is ample        evidence that this is an effective and reproducible detector and a predictor of        progression and symptomatic disease  In contrast angiography is invasive and is        insensitive to early changes in the artery wall thickness Magnetic resonance imaging is        expensive cumbersome and still experimental Calcium scoring by computed tomography is        less sensitive and less reproducible and suggests plaque presence only indirectly         Angiography and calcium scoring entail considerable X ray exposure        Using highsensitivity carotid ultrasound as a primary screening tool would add modest        cost but that would be more than offset by sharply reducing the enormous worldwide toll of        atherosclerosis Screening tests should be easy affordable widely available and        predictive Carotid ultrasound meets all these criteria and should be used to screen        everyone early on who is at any increased risk by measure of the expanded risk factors        noted above                    Makovers Response to Ebrahims Viewpoint        While the population approach is obviously very important there is no reason not to        use the high risk approach as well High risk is the wrong term        all arteries matter over a year life span We must attack        atherosclerosis at the very onset not wait until it is high risk All previous        approaches were designed to detect those at allegedly higher risk by various criteria This        misses the point Once plaque exists risk exists especially when viewed over a full        lifetime not the current tenyear standard And although the aggressive approach I        outlined in my viewpoint would obviously have a cost the savings a reduction in the        financial toll of cardiovascular disease would be greater than the cost        Ultrasonography of the carotid artery intimal wall is effective and highly predictive        according to the great preponderance of studies  Ebrahim cites two studies to support        his argument that measuring carotid IMT offers no additional predictive power over        conventional screening tools  but the first of these has serious flaws such as a        significant dropout rate that the authors assumed was random a short followup period and        the inclusion only of people of an advanced age  and the other concluded that carotid        IMT measurement substantially improved prediction of future coronary heart disease                Millions of people are at risk now and cannot wait for endless studies to prove over and        over what we already know It is not nave for well people to want to remain well and to        maintain their arteries to enable healthy older lives Nor should we disparage as worried        the very human desire to remain that way Populationwide planning is important but        doctors take care of each patient as an individual Carotid ultrasonography is by far the        best way to design treatment for every patient exactly as needed I believe that there is        already sufficient evidence and sensible rationale to meld already wellproven technologies        and approaches into a comprehensive aggressive attack on atherosclerosis
