                                 Making It                        Hello Richard            I wanted to go back to something you said yesterday asit has been rattling around my brain all night You noted an immense dividebetween wiredup screwedup America  and a quieter America where men maysuffer far less from identity crises because they are trying to get by ratherthan get ahead I have already discussed the fact that wired up America isfar more extensive than its presumably screwed up epicenters But now I wantto address the notion that one must be in Los Angeles New York or theequivalent to be getting ahead That formulation strikes me as emblematic ofthe very ornamental culture that Faludi derides For many of the peoplebattling it out in these places winning or getting ahead means beingnoticed by the otherson camera in the news in a magazine and so on Thementality of others notice me therefore I am is quite appropriate if you are years old but pretty pathetic for a grownup This ornamental culture islike a perpetual twilight of adolescence it is a thwarted adulthood For thosewho exist only in the gaze of others getting ahead may well mean achievingmore time at the center of attention but that really gets them nowhere newand least of all ahead Maybe that explains Susan Faludis enigmatic visageon the cover of Newsweek participating in theornamentation thing but knowing better            The real challenge of getting ahead as an adult isfar more complex It involves the work of forging an identity that hascoherence and integrity whether or not anyone is looking But adultdevelopment as Gilligan Kegan and many others have noted does not stopthere with the achievement of an autonomous identity It can also mean learningthat my humanity is larger than the roles I inhabit and in the exploration ofmy individuality I also paradoxically discover the possibility of a deeperconnection with many kinds of people Autonomy is not an end in itself but afoundation for the ongoing work of individuation and real intimacy Thesetriumphs of adulthood are hard won and as you said about children they oftenspring from darkness and grief They always spring from engaging with themessiness of real life            All over America and indeed all over the world peopleare getting ahead in this truer sense they are not merely getting byThey are geologists and hospice workers and emergencyroom doctors and researchscientists and lobstermen and forest rangers and cooks and microbiologists andfarmers and mechanics and entrepreneurs and programmers and smallbusinesspeople and mothers and veterinarians and teachers They are in the hills of thealtiplano caring for their land and their animals and their families They arein the Brazilian rain forest fighting ranchers and government ineptitude Theyare in East Timor standing for independence They are in all the quiet placeswhere the cameras do not roam making love making family making dinner andmaking a world They are not hanging around making bombs and complaining aboutlost dominance Nor is Donald Trump their role model They are too busy forthat Too busy getting ahead            I am persuaded that the new economy already shows signsof offering much more opportunity for adults to move beyond the conformistpressures of the large  th centuryorganizations and the fragmented identities of industrial society I think thisemerging era will provide more adults with the possibility of becomingindividuals as it enables us to reintegrate work and life in many new rich andvaried patterns And by the way only about  percent of those home offices Imentioned yesterday are dedicated to telework            Once again hats off to Susan Faludi for theauthenticity of her effort and the seriousness of her subject Whether or not Iagree with her analysis I do think that these times require a reexamination ofmany centuryold formulations including masculinity and particularly the rolethat gender has played in the maintenance of traditional economic models Maythe debate continue so that we can all well get ahead             As everShoshana Zuboff
