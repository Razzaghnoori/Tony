 Making It Hello Richard I wanted to go back to something you said yesterday as it has been rattling around my brain all night You noted an immense divide between wired up screwed up America and a quieter America where men may suffer far less from identity crises because they are trying to get by rather than get ahead I have already discussed the fact that wired up America is far more extensive than its presumably screwed up epicenters But now I want to address the notion that one must be in Los Angeles New York or the equivalent to be getting ahead That formulation strikes me as emblematic of the very ornamental culture that Faludi derides For many of the people battling it out in these places winning or getting ahead means being noticed by the others on camera in the news in a magazine and so on The mentality of others notice me therefore I am is quite appropriate if you are 14 years old but pretty pathetic for a grown up This ornamental culture is like a perpetual twilight of adolescence it is a thwarted adulthood For those who exist only in the gaze of others getting ahead may well mean achieving more time at the center of attention but that really gets them nowhere new and least of all ahead Maybe that explains Susan Faludi s enigmatic visage on the cover of Newsweek participating in the ornamentation thing but knowing better The real challenge of getting ahead as an adult is far more complex It involves the work of forging an identity that has coherence and integrity whether or not anyone is looking But adult development as Gilligan Kegan and many others have noted does not stop there with the achievement of an autonomous identity It can also mean learning that my humanity is larger than the roles I inhabit and in the exploration of my individuality I also paradoxically discover the possibility of a deeper connection with many kinds of people Autonomy is not an end in itself but a foundation for the ongoing work of individuation and real intimacy These triumphs of adulthood are hard won and as you said about children they often spring from darkness and grief They always spring from engaging with the messiness of real life All over America and indeed all over the world people are getting ahead in this truer sense they are not merely getting by They are geologists and hospice workers and emergency room doctors and research scientists and lobstermen and forest rangers and cooks and microbiologists and farmers and mechanics and entrepreneurs and programmers and small business people and mothers and veterinarians and teachers They are in the hills of the altiplano caring for their land and their animals and their families They are in the Brazilian rain forest fighting ranchers and government ineptitude They are in East Timor standing for independence They are in all the quiet places where the cameras do not roam making love making family making dinner and making a world They are not hanging around making bombs and complaining about lost dominance Nor is Donald Trump their role model They are too busy for that Too busy getting ahead I am persuaded that the new economy already shows signs of offering much more opportunity for adults to move beyond the conformist pressures of the large 20 th century organizations and the fragmented identities of industrial society I think this emerging era will provide more adults with the possibility of becoming individuals as it enables us to reintegrate work and life in many new rich and varied patterns And by the way only about 20 percent of those home offices I mentioned yesterday are dedicated to telework Once again hats off to Susan Faludi for the authenticity of her effort and the seriousness of her subject Whether or not I agree with her analysis I do think that these times require a reexamination of many century old formulations including masculinity and particularly the role that gender has played in the maintenance of traditional economic models May the debate continue so that we can all well get ahead As ever Shoshana Zuboff
