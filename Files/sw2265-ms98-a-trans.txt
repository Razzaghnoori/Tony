 uh tell you what um i ll let you start or if that s all right okay um my major source of information i guess is TV news excuse me i uh wake up to it in the morning this is my i guess my prime time for news first thing in the morning while i m getting ready to go to work oh i quite frequently uh glance through headlines or in the newspaper but uh primarily mine is uh TV news how about yourself pretty interesting yeah i have to have to agree with you um normally don t have time in the morning to to watch the any type of TV usually catch it going to work on the radio or when i drag the paper in from the front and it pops out of the bag i usually catch the headlines which is normally what you see the night before on the evening news yeah so uh i ve kind of um um true uh we have a one year old in the house so it s kind of hard sometimes to watch TV during the during the during the night but i usually try to catch the ten o clock or um um those type of issues i d to say during the war uh there were we were the American public was probably flooded with um uh huh uh too much information and as far as the sub question about was i satisfied am i satisfied with the coverage i d have to say yes but when it came to the war issues it was like who s telling the truth you could between the channels there was uh the casualties were differently the amount of missiles launched were different and it was almost too much information over communicated well that s true but uh i uh my personal opinion is that the uh the various network news medias were uh trying to interpret the news to the best of their abilities since they were not very well informed by the military true i agree with you now i can appreciate that especially after what happened in Vietnam yeah which is a is a joke uh but i mean let s face it today s today s uh means of communications we could uh very well a newscaster could very well give away away a piece of top secret information um hum and uh pat himself on the back for for uh making a big scoop yeah that s a good point uh but i would have to say across the board i m i m satisfied with the way uh the news is is spread um of course here at Texas Instruments uh the rumor mill runs rampant the secretary s probably are the best resource of what the layoff status is very true i find T News very enlightening and i check that everyday and of course with that goes along the the stock price of TI yes yeah yeah yeah yeah i agree with you i i m glad you mentioned that because i think i have to since i don t have the opportunity in the morning i ll probably catch the the head lines on T News that s a good point of course T News is is more or less headlines uh i don t think much of of their sports coverage um hum yeah true kind of short all they give the scores yeah least but uh that s right i m not yeah outside of of uh pro football i m not too interested in other games uh other sports anyway um hum but uh the the T News is is a good way to keep up to date i think they do a pretty good job selecting the most important items well that s great yeah i do i surely do they do they surely do uh anything anything else cross your mind uh i guess most of us go by the audio which is the the television television or the radio uh huh um yeah but you need to continue to read so you you can people learn to read you know well i spent twenty years in professional in uh commercial broadcasting ten in radio and then ten in uh TV and i know what it takes to get some of those little bits and of bits and pieces of news on the air hm uh i mean there there are times where uh video uh reporter actually will risk is life life and limb i ve seen it happen time and time again and uh well i remember one time up in Nashville Tennessee was one of the fellows fellows got mixed up in a with a riot going on down there but he was lucky he got out of it hm for some reason because he was carrying a camera uh they left him alone ouch everybody got excited um hum that s tough that s tough well i ve enjoyed speaking with you nice talking to you too Jim did you get your catalog on your your your gifts no oh yeah i just got mine in the mail so it kind of inspires me to keep calling oh well i ll have to be looking for it then yeah they re not to shabby they re pretty good is that right well good yes sir have a great day bye bye you too
