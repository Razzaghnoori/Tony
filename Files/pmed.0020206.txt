                            As a neurologist subspecializing in epilepsy at a respected academic institution I DH        assumed that I knew everything I needed to know about epilepsy and patients with epilepsy        I was wrong        In September of  John Lester my colleague in the Department of Neurology at        Massachusetts General Hospital showed me an online bulletin board for neurology patients        that he had created  In reading through the online messages I observed hundreds of        patients with neurological diseases sharing their experiences and discussing their problems        with one another        I knew that many patients with chronic diseases had been making use of online medical        information  Nonetheless I was shocked fascinated and more than a bit confused by        what I saw Id been trained in the old medical school style my instructors had insisted        that patients could not be trusted to understand or manage complex medical matters        Thinking back through my years of training and practice I realized that there had always        been an unspoken prohibition against groups of patients getting together I had the        uncomfortable sense that by promoting interactions between patients and deemphasizing the        central role of the physician I might be violating some deep taboo                    Remarkably Complex Stories        My initial doubts notwithstanding I found dozens of wellinformed medically competent        patients sharing information on a variety of topics I was especially struck by the many        stories recounting the development of a particular patients illness the patients efforts        to manage it and the resulting interactions with health professionals By telling their        stories in such elaborate detail experienced group members could offer a great deal of        useful advice and guidance to those newly diagnosed based on what they had learned in        their own online research what they had been told by their clinicians and what they had        deduced from personal experiences with the disease        These patient stories often included a number of empowering elements that set them        apart from the advice patients typically receive from their clinicians role modeling by an        active critical wellinformed expert patient  httppatientwebnet comparative        reviews and recommendations of clinicians and treatment facilities  and advice about        how to handle the practical details of living with a chronic illness  such as how to        organize a home medical record manage treatment side effects find the best drug prices        and deal with lessthanperfect health professionals and healthcare provider systems and        a wide variety of other topics relating to effective medical selfmanagement These        extended patient narrativesno two alikethus gave rise to an accumulated body of what my        colleagues and I began to think of as an expert patient knowledge base We concluded that        these patient narratives could be invaluable resources for clinicians and researchers        interested in taking an indepth look at the changing roles of patients and clinicians in        the Internet age        The constant outpouring of sympathy and support that we observed in interactions among        community members surpassed anything a patient might conceivably expect to receive at a        doctors office As Richard Rockefeller President of the Health Commons Institute has        suggested diseasespecific online patient networks provide their members with an        invaluable type of aroundtheclock support that he has called the chicken soup of the        Internet         Working with several colleagues I initiated an observational study to analyze the ways        in which Epatients were using this new medium Since I am an epilepsy specialist we        decided to focus on an epilepsy support group at the site Lester had created BrainTalk        Communities httpwwwbraintalkorg Figure   The BrainTalk Communities currently        host more than  free online groups for neurological conditions such as Alzheimer        disease multiple sclerosis Parkinson disease chronic pain epilepsy and Huntington        disease for patients across the globe More than  individuals visit the BrainTalk        Communities Web site on a regular basis This site is now owned and operated by an        independent nonprofit group BrainTalk Communities and is no longer formally associated        with Massachusetts General Hospital        What we found surprised us We assumed that most interactions would be support related        with some members describing their medical experiences and others offering active        listening sympathy and understanding But while such interactions were an important part        of the group process they were observed in only about  of the postings In the        remaining  of the postings group members provided each other with what amounted to a        crash course in their shared disease discussing topics such as the anatomy physiology        and natural history of the disorder treatment options and management guidelines for each        form of treatment and treatment side effects medical selfmanagement the daytoday        practicalities of living with the disease and the effects of their condition on family and        friends Table                     A Source of Information        Much of the information that the group provided to members was similar to what I        routinely provided to my own clinic patients So I was surprised to learn that many of the        clinicians caring for group members provided considerably less information guidance and        support And some apparently provided none at all Statements such as My provider is too        busy My provider doesnt care or My provider doesnt seem to know about        suchandsuch were alarmingly common About  of the members posts spontaneously        mentioned that they had been unable to get the medical information that they needed from        their own clinicians When we surveyed members directly more than  said that they had        been unable to obtain all the medical information they would have liked from their        physicians Table  This was a primary reason for many members participation in the        group        Some other types of information especially practical tips for living with epilepsy and        the social aspects of the disease went far beyond what I had been providing for my own        patients I am a boardcertified epilepsy specialist at one of the most highly respected        medical centers in the United States yet I learned a great deal about these topics from        the support group I now share many of the things I learned from group members with my        clinic patients        The BrainTalk Communities epilepsy support group that we observed was facilitated by        volunteer patient moderators with little or no professional input About  of the        postings contained information that some of our medical reviewers considered at least        partly mistaken misinterpreted outdated or incomplete We observed that other group        members frequently corrected such misinformation And group participants appeared to        understand that they should not take uncorroborated statements as hard facts They seemed        well aware that some postings were erroneous and in fact seemed to substantially        overestimate the incidence of questionable materials        We observed no serious problems as a result of these questionable postings and saw many        reports by patients who had obtained better care prevented medical mistakes or averted        serious injury because of the information and advice they received from fellow group        members We concluded that as Ferguson and Frydman have suggested many professionals have        seriously overestimated the risks and underestimated the benefits of online support groups        and other online health resources for patients probably because they do not operate within        our familiar professionally centered constructs                     What Ive Learned        In retrospect the most important thing I DH have learned from our online group was        that patients want to know about and in most cases are perfectly capable of understanding        and dealing with everything their physician knows about their disease and its treatments        After observing the group I realized that I had been providing my patients with a very        limited subset of what I knew about their condition Today there is nothing that I know        about epilepsy that I would hesitate to share with a patient For example I now offer my        patients an open and frank discussion of the very rare sudden unexpected death in epilepsy        syndrome I had previously not mentioned this rare but alarming complication fearing that        some patients might become overly concerned with it But once I discovered that BrainTalk        Communities group members discussed this topic quite openly and freely online reviewing        the scientific data in a sophisticated way I began to share my knowledge on this topic        with my clinic patients My newfound frankness has been much appreciated And none of my        patients have become unduly troubled by these discussions        I have also learned that an online group like the BrainTalk Communities epilepsy group        is not only much smarter than any single patient but is also smarter or at least more        comprehensive than many physicianseven many medical specialists While some postings do        contain erroneous material online groups of patients who share an illness engage in a        continuous process of selfcorrection challenging questionable statements and addressing        misperceptions as they occur And while no single resource including physicians should be        considered the last word in medical knowledge the consensus opinion arrived at by patient        groups is usually quite excellent And if more expert clinicians offered to consult        informally with the online support groups devoted to their medical specialtiesas I now        dowe could help group members make information and opinion shared in these groups even        better        I had been taught to believe that patients could only be empowered by their        clinicians And while I do believe that clinicians can help in this regard by sharing their        knowledge openly and by encouraging patient selfreliance it now seems quite clear that        growing numbers of patients are perfectly capable of empowering themselves with or without        their clinicians blessing Physicians and other health professionals should do all they        can to support them in this worthy effort        As a result of what weve learned from these online patient networks our research group        has developed a passwordprotected Web site PatientWeb httpsfishermghharvardedu        for the patients that we see in the clinicall those patients with epilepsy who receive        medical care at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Womens Hospital Thanks        to what we have learned from these online groups we plan to pilot new ways for private        local online groups made up of patients with the same disease and receiving care from the        same clinicians to collaborate with each other and with their clinicians more        effectively                    Conclusions        Clinicians have overestimated the downsides while seriously underestimating the        benefits of conditionspecific online patient support communities These free online        resources now provide invaluable services  hours a day seven days a week for patients        across the country and around the world It would be unfortunate indeed if medical        professionals let their uneasiness at this emerging trend toward patient empowerment and        autonomy cloud their ability to assess the impressive benefits these groups provide        Many patients are now ready willing and able to take a more active role in their own        care and the care of others with related diseases By encouraging patients to do more for        themselves and for each other clinicians can help mitigate many of the negative effects of        contemporary timepressured medical practice Thus even though there may now be less time        for the counseling storytelling support information sharing and empowermentbased        training that was once a routine part of the typical office visit we can now help our        patients obtain such services by referring them to online patient networks        The distributed expertise of online support groups is by no means limited to the        emotional aspects of the illness and to the practical logistics of living with the        disorder It can also include current reviews of the literature reports from the latest        medical meetings accounts of behindthescenes activities at the best treatment centers        sophisticated guidance on dealing with medical professionals and excellent advice on        dealing with complex aspects of medical management        Finally I have concluded that few if any physicians could have created a system like        BrainTalk Communities As a techsavvy nonphysician intimately familiar with both the        inner workings of medical care and the power of information technology systems to create        effective online communities John Lester was less proprietary than most physicians are        about medicines proper professional turf He was also less inhibited by professional        biases regarding the potential value of the medical contributions that unqualified        individuals might make This is not an isolated occurrence We suspect that the intensely        professionally centered enculturation most physicians receive in their training and        practice environments may render them in the words of John Seely Brown and Paul Draguld        blinkered if not blind to the emergence of many promising new technocultural changes        which currently present new opportunities for healthcare innovation  Thus physicians        who seek to innovate in these areas might benefit greatlyas I havefrom joining forces        with Web developers Netsavvy social scientists experienced Epatients and other        colleagues unencumbered by the limiting belief systems that may result from our traditional        medical training        In light of their empowering social dynamics and volunteer economics we suspect that        patientled online groups may prove to be a considerably more promising and sustainable        healthcare resource than professionally moderated therapy groups And we are convinced        that networked work teams linking patients caregivers and medical professionals will be        an important model for future healthcare innovation
