 Movie Evita Hollywood Pictures After months of tie ins fashion reviews books and all out hype the reviews are in and critics still can t tell if Evita s a movie The New Yorker s Anthony Lane calls it more of a film version of a stage show the New York Times Janet Maslin calls it Madonna s most colossal music video Evita has three main problems according to critics 1 It lacks humanity This is a weird inert terribly distant piece of moviemaking says New York s David Denby 2 It lacks a point 3 It has awful politics it s a kind of fascist pseudo opera Denby It s The Triumph of Her i e Madonna s Will the Wall Street Journal s Joe Morgenstern Madonna fares slightly better but only slightly At a certain point you realize that Madonna hasn t a single musical moment that goes beyond artful amplified competence Morgenstern The official Evita site has the works clips stills audio Madonna on The Role of a Lifetime etc Also check out Louis Menand s review of the film in Slate Movie Portrait of a Lady Gramercy Male critics cringe at Jane Campion s Portrait of a Lady female critics call it her masterwork Jane Campion has done something of which I never thought her capable writes The New Yorker s Lane S he has made a boring film The New Republic s Stanley Kauffmann deems the film a feminist morality play But the New York Times Maslin calls the movie daring abstract and filled with imagination and surprise the Village Voice s Amy Taubin declares As Raging Bull is to Martin Scorsese Portrait of a Lady is to Jane Campion See the film s official Web site Book A Life of Picasso Volume 2 1907 1917 by John Richardson with the collaboration of Marilyn McCully Random House Almost every critic has heaped praise on the second volume of John Richardson s biography of Pablo Picasso which covers the painter s cubist period Magisterial declares Frances Spalding in the Times of London It s among the grand English language biographies of our time says poet Richard Howard in the New York Times Book Review And art historian Dore Ashton describes it as definitive The New Yorker s Adam Gopnik is the notable exception He accuses Richardson both of crudeness he sees sex as the meaning of every painting and of whitewashing his subject he downplays Picasso s misogyny Without the Continuing Saga of Pablo s Greatness there s not much there except some wonderful drawings and a lot of irritability Random House plugs Richardson s book at its site Musical Once Upon a Mattress The Broadhurst Theatre on Broadway The revival of the 1959 musical is being hailed as one of the most monumental Broadway flops in years Misbegotten says Ben Brantley of the New York Times Dead on delivery agrees Clive Barnes of the New York Post Based on Hans Christian Andersen s story The Princess and the Pea the production features Sarah Jessica Parker in the role that made Carol Burnett a star Donald Lyons of the Wall Street Journal says that Parker lacks the whimsy and stupid Lucille Ball like humor to pull it off The critics add that the musical itself which had a plot that was forgettable and incoherent was pretty lame to start with Movie Hamlet Columbia Kenneth Branagh masterful Shakespearean or insufferable egomaniac Reviews of his four hour Hamlet with its unlikely cast Billy Crystal Robin Williams Charlton Heston don t resolve the question In the pro Branagh camp lie the New York Times Maslin and the Los Angeles Times Kevin Thomas who actually likes Branagh s Hollywood touches such as the to be or not to be soliloquy performed before a two way mirror In the other camp is John Anderson of Newsday who derides Branagh s antic energy and New York s Denby who calls the film overscaled huge and hideously exposed He says that e ven the soliloquies come off as an extrovert s meditations as bouts of self loathing such as Leonard Bernstein might have had after a bad concert Check out the Hamlet Web site which has everything you ever cared to know about Branagh and about interactive Hamlet games Book The Odyssey by Homer translated by Robert Fagles Viking The new translation of Homer s The Odyssey has whipped up so much fervor that Paul Gray in Time has proclaimed the existence of the Fagles phenomenon Robert Fagles a Princeton classicist translated The Iliad in 1990 and sold an astonishing 140 000 paperback copies of his version Anticipating similar sales Viking shipped 27 000 copies of The Odyssey to bookstores and 10 000 copies of a tape of the actor Ian McKellen reading it Gray attributes Fagles popularity to his simple straightforward language Other reviewers place Fagles work in the same league as Fitzgerald s and Lattimore s classic translations In the New York Times Book Review Richard Jenkyns declares Fagles language timeless Updates The backlash against The People vs Larry Flynt has begun Early reviews offered high praise for Milos Forman s loving portrait of the pornography magnate but recent articles in the New York Times and the New Republic point out that the film s hero the publisher of Hustler actually was a racist misogynistic scum bag Louis Menand writing in the New York Review of Books calls Michael Crichton s techno thriller Airframe commercial culture s revenge on itself More plaudits for Margaret Atwood s Victorian thriller Alias Grace In the New York Times Book Review Francine Prose compares the book to a 19
