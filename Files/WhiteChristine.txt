                     This is an interview with Tammy White         Where were you born                     I was born in Charlotte                     How long ago                     Hmph  years  years ago                  I was there for  years                     So you are a native Charlottean                     Until I moved to Gaston County which was seven or eight years ago                     I guess you pretty well seen that town grow up                     I still work in Charlotte                  I still feel like I live there since Gaston County is only five minutes next door to Charlotte                     Whats changed the most about the city since youve been a child                            And add more                  Didnt used to be so dangerous to drive and now it is very dangerous to drive         I dont think they should let kids drive anymore         Not until theyre about   years old         I think they should have a learners permit for a long time                  Weve had so many people move in from everywhere                     I guess you dont even recognize Charlotte anymore its changed so much                     I recognize it because it changes with me each and everyday         Dont look like it used to                              What where were you born in Charlotte                     Presbyterian Hospital                     That was in December                               Yeah         I was the first granddaughter born         There were a bunch of grandsons on both sides of the family         So I was named after each grandmother and Mama liked Tammy and stuck it in the middle         So I had a real long name when I went to school         I was in the first grade before I found out what my whole name was                     What was your whole name                     Christine Tammy Marie Watkins         I lay my head down on the desk and cried because I had to learn how to write a long name and everyone elses was short         Id been writing Tammy Watkins                  I could read and write before I went to school because Mama had a lot of time to spend with me         My next sister wasnt born until I was like five years old         Long pause The teachers were upset because I was way ahead of everybody else                  They didnt know what to do with me                     Like a misfit                     And I got in trouble all the time                  They still liked me though they still helped me                     What do you remember as a child         Tell me the story about the coat                     Which one         The big furry blue coat                     Yeah                     That was like in the fifth grade fourth grade         Blue was my favorite color         Everything I had was blue         So Mama and Daddy bought me a big blue furry coat for my birthday or Christmas         I dont know         Birthday and Christmas run together         Usually what I got for birthday was for Christmas and Christmas for birthday         Because my birthday was so close to Christmas I only got one present         It was a big old ugly blue fur coat         I felt like a big blue polar bear         So I hid it under the bushes on the way to the bus and pick it up on the way home         Same things kids do now except they pick out their own coats         They just change their mind after a week         Long pause I was a tomboy         I only had boys to play with                  When I was little I used to want to be a boy                  When I grew up I wondered why         Why you want to be something that was so inhuman                              Why do you say that                                       Well guys are all right as long as theyre your friends                           I still have more guy friends than girlfriends         Even after all these years                              Remember anything else as a little child                                       Jumping off high buildings         Swinging a swing as far as it would go and jump out of it and see who could jump the farthest         Or wed take the swing and pull the swing out all the way around until it until it dunked and wed swing all the way around the top of it         Wed build playhouses out in the woods tree houses out in the woods         We dig a we dug an underground cavern out of the mud one time and stole a bunch of stuff from all the houses around         We had carpet in there and rugs and furniture and everything         We played in it a couple of years until the parents found out and then they had a fit they said we could have smothered to death if it fell in or rained or anything         That was neat         You had to climb down in it         It looked real neat too it looked better than some of our houses         Dug it out little by little made it bigger         Of course it probably wasnt as big as I remember it to be                  I used to love to go up to my Aunt Sandras house because she had three boys and shed let us run wild through the neighborhood         When I was at home with Mama and Daddy wouldnt even let me out of the yard         They watched me like a hawk         Sandra was scared to death when it was time for Mama to come pick me up because Id be muddy and dirty from head to toe                  Mama hated it that I was a tomboy                  She always bought me dolls and everything         She knew I didnt want dolls         Theyd just sit there in my room                     What about them dogs         Hum                     Oh the dogs         I dont I dont really remember some of the dogs but I remember more what she told me         I remember being and having the dogs all around         That was before Debbie was born         I was like three or four         And theres pictures pictures of me with the dogs         Mama said there was like six dogs that run through the neighborhood         And she said she was always playing with me that and she said she never worried about them hurting me         She said that I was up in a tree or something and she told me to come to her                  And she started started pulling me or something I dont remember exactly so the dogs circled her and snarled and growled at her and she got backed back into the house         And I wouldnt come in because I knew I was going to get a whipping for climbing up in that tree         And later I guess I forgot and she knew I would         I guess she bribed me to come in with some candy and and then she tore my tail up         She said it still didnt stop me      from hanging around with the dogs or anything she felt like they because protected me I could stay out in the yard for hours and shed check on me like every  minutes and I was taken care of         She said nobody else would bother me either         Said never occurred to her that those dogs might hurt me but they never did         Said I always had a gift for animals      I guess because I was never afraid of them         Now that Im older Ive grown afraid of them and they can tell it                              What about your secret garden                     Oh yeah         I was when I was in junior high in eighth grade                     Hum         What happened                     Went through wed ride bikes through the woods and everything         I loved to ride bikes         Rode bikes for a long time until I was a big old girl         And we went into the woods and there was bunch of vines that covered like a blanket         And Id walk through those vines and it was real shady and cool         Itd be like  or  degrees cooler than it was outside         And there were big rocks and a nice creek big giant rocks         Id sit our there and read      or whatever         It was just peaceful         And I took Mama out there one time and asked her if shed spend the day with me         Just one time because she always worked she didnt have much time to spend with us         That was after she left Daddy                  I got her a bicycle I borrowed a bicycle for her         She pushed it most of the way         She couldnt ride it         It hurt her legs         I couldnt understand that         I thought it was a whole lot easier to ride that bike than walking         Fixed us a picnic lunch and she brought a book and we went out there         And she still talks about that         She really liked it         She said it was really just as beautiful as I always said it was         Its gone now                     Bulldozed over         A new project slapped up                     I dont know who it belonged to         It was out behind the houses                     That was over on Arrowood Road                     No that was um that was in Huntersville         When Mama left Daddy we went and moved out to Huntersville                     Oh                     For a little while         We used to go in the woods back by back off Arrowood Road         I lived in Windsong Trail thats right across the street when we lived on Arrowood Road         We didnt move very far that time         Wed go out there and pick blackberries and sell them out in the woods         I had a friend of mine he huffed a can of   and died when he was camping out         And uh one of his guys buddies that was with him just got sick and ended up in the hospital         Long pause I think everybody cried                  He was a popular boy                     Kids just dont know how easy it is to die                     Well so huffing is nothing new they did it when I was kid         I didnt hear about it as much then as I do now though                  And boy hed take up for um all the underdogs         So a lot of people were sad                  I hung around with uh one girl and um two guys and then later we uh had another girl join our group         I hung around with them boys from the fourth grade on up to through to high school         But when Mama left Daddy and everything and we moved away and then moved back I still went to school with them                  Kenny Kenny huh               He died not too long ago on a motorcycle                     Didnt you go up in the mountains for a summer or something with your aunt                     Yeah         One week out of the summer every year                     Where they live                        They lived in um Black Mountain for a long time and then they moved to   another mountain                     Thats in NC                     Uh huh                              So you never did leave the state did you                     Um uh                     I know Earl use

                            What did you do up in the mountains                     Everything                     Did you make a quilt                     No                     Did you churn butter                     No         They were more modern up there than we were down here                  My aunt and uncle were teachers and principals         She had a boy that was about Debbies age         And shed take me to uh not not every year but there were some years shed take me to a day camp because she wanted me to play with kids my age and she didnt have any         And shed take me out shopping and buy me all kind of new clothes         She wanted a little girl      and I was it         Because all my boy cousins got to go up there and stay every summer too for a week         And she said they about run her crazy         She said I was the only slow time she got         She said Id help her and everything and I enjoyed helping her         Went to the library                     Did you ever go horseback riding or anything                     Yes                  I didnt go horseback riding up in the mountains         Mama paid for my lessons down here in Charlotte         And then she couldnt pay for them anymore so I started working in the stables to continue then         It was English English style back riding                  I used to skip school during junior high and steal a pony and return it and go back home         Did that a lot         Long pause                     Remember anything else as a      child                     I remember a lot of things Im just not going to put it on this tape                           Then my children will hear it and then try to pull it too                  Im still friends with some of my high school elementary school and junior high friends         I see them about once every six months or a year         Some more often than that                     Who was your best friend                     Well Kenny and Billy were my best friends until I met Angie         Angie was Ive known Angie as long as Kenny and Billy but she was more into boys for other reasons than what I was and I was just not mature enough for boys yet except to play with         So she kind of bored me         She ended up having like six kids later with three or four different guys         I really dont know                     So I guess you havent talked to her in a long time                     Not since um I had Justin         I seen her the last time when I had Justin         Not since Marshall was born         Worked at BP Oil on Park Rd          she used to come in there all the time         That was on the south side of town         We were raised on the south side of town                     That side sure has grown up hasnt it                     There are still parts over there I still dont recognize
