 A Modern Woman Hermione Lee s biography of Virginia Woolf is a revelation Not that Lee offers any startling new gossip On the contrary The facts that she juggles have sat in the public domain for years and the story has been worn to threads by frequent telling Woolf was born Virginia Stephen in 1882 the freakishly talented spectacularly cheekboned youngest daughter of Leslie Stephen a successful but depressive London intellectual and Julia Duckworth a stoic beauty who brought to the marriage children of her own Virginia s early years were drenched in book chat but otherwise not so different from other crowded stifling Victorian youths The children had a swarm of spinster aunts curious animal inspired nicknames like Ape and Marmot and not a moment of privacy Then disaster struck struck and struck again First Virginia s mysterious and saintly mother broke under the strain of Victorian women s work nursing invalids running a staff of servants though the immediate cause of death was rheumatic fever Then her father in his grief selfishly leaned on Virginia s half sister Stella for support and after a period of exhausted servitude she died too Virginia spent her teens getting over a nervous breakdown the recovery was delayed by her half brother George who chased her around the house and fondled her When her father followed Julia and Stella to the grave Virginia and her sister Vanessa and their brothers Thoby and Adrian left their posh family home for the decrepit neighborhood of Bloomsbury They invited Thoby s smart ambitious Cambridge cronies Lytton Strachey Clive Bell and John Maynard Keynes over for unchaperoned partying Soon they began to talk about and experiment with sex straight and otherwise except perhaps Virginia whose libido at this stage was according to Lee dribbled away on childish crushes on maternal women Most of all Virginia wrote supporting herself with a brutal workload of reviews dreaming of delicate but radical new ways to tell a story This is Woolf s back story as it were the preface to her bohemian celebrity during the 1920s Even in the bare bones narration it s fertile Almost too fertile in fact as open to selective interpretation as a Rorschach test Depending on whom you consult following her apprenticeship in suffering Woolf became the woman who wrote To The Lighthouse and The Waves a stream of consciousness pioneer and a cool ethereal priestess of high modernism Or the rage filled victim of abuse and feminist crusader of A Room of One s Own Or to her detractors a frivolous gossip Luckily for us Lee isn t especially invested in any of these eye catching slants She accepts that all these versions of Woolf are more or less fair And she believes that Woolf s writing reflects a lifetime spent contemplating her strange tangle of traits For lack of a better word this is the most lifelike biography I ve ever read Lee counts on our basic familiarity with Woolf s story and this frees her up to tease it into all kinds of subtle themes in much the same way you or I might retrospectively organize our lives under such motley headings as Life Under Reagan or The Period When I Was Especially Close to Jim A visceral early chapter on the houses of Woolf s childhood tells us what sensory data the little girl would have absorbed the constant smell of cigars the pale yellow shade covering the window that overlooked the sea Later chapters calmly walk us through some of the more hotly debated Woolfian themes matching each exactly to its place in Woolf s life Female friendships supplied critical nurturing Lee says and the famous affair with Vita Sackville West was a thrill but Woolf never saw herself as a strict Sapphist As for her husband Leonard he earned Virginia s complete loyalty by stoically caring for her during her breakdowns but he comes across as stiff humorless and inclined to unconsciously pull male rank Maybe it s the unusual non mustiness of Lee s approach but I was struck by the number of current concerns that Woolf s life anticipates Living at the mercy of her quixotic brain chemistry she took notes on her moods observing when her head felt cool and quiet or sizzling She was precociously attuned to the interplay of mind and body far more so than her peers One also wonders whether if Woolf were alive today she would join the hordes of writers abandoning fiction for the memoir Probably not Her ambition love of make believe and need to experiment would have driven her back to the novel Yet she felt the impulse to tell her story directly Lee guesses that it was because Woolf predicted in advance the ridicule of her male friends and literary competitors that she kept herself from doing so Here is her despairing diary entry after she visited a memoir club and read a chapter aloud I couldn t help figuring a kind of uncomfortable boredom on the part of the males to whose genial cheerful sense my revelations were at once mawkish and distasteful What ever possessed me to lay bare my soul Lee demonstrates brilliantly the centrality of this issue of male censorship real and perceived to Woolf s writing Growing up in her father s shadow Woolf felt perfectly comfortable writing like a smug Victorian patriarch But she understood that a tone of cool authoritativeness left no room for her childhood catastrophes her anger at getting a girl s paltry education her palpable delight in reading To discuss such experiences she needed a less omniscient voice a new style one that in its fragmentation would become a hallmark of modernism But she was afraid to go too far to alienate all the genial cheerful men whose standards she continued to internalize As a result Woolf constantly seesaws in her writing between revealing and concealing To be perfectly honest I think the tension hurt her fiction I ve always admired her novels but found the experience of reading them frustratingly indirect circular dissociative Now I begin to understand why On the other hand Woolf s back and forth led to insights that escaped the male modernists Lee argues that Woolf s essays are badly undervalued today and she s right Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown the defense of modernism she delivered before a puzzled Cambridge audience in 1924 seems in retrospect wiser and more realistic than just about everything else on the subject In that essay Woolf explained that she and Joyce and Eliot and the rest had no choice but to abandon baggy old Victorianism Why Because as she famously proposed on or about December 1910 human character changed and it was the writer s duty to explain this change to readers Note the humble attention to human character and readers not just to high art and artists Woolf stood up for her peers but she also understood if people found her overweeningly concerned with style or found Eliot obscure or Joyce obscene a pimply undergraduate She knew that modernism was a work in progress not a new system to be defended to the death In Lee s hands Woolf s feminism becomes more radical and more flexible than one might think She was no dogmatist She even thought feminist was a dead and corrupt word now that women had the right to earn a living But later in life she argued that it was not enough for women to get rooms of their own in which to become towering dominant writers like men She challenged the ugly human desire to be towering and dominant She went as always to the question of human character wondering if there might be a moral advantage in the centuries women had spent as anonymous people of no status She played with the notion of a Society of Outsiders without office meetings leaders or any hierarchy without so much as a form to be filled up or a secretary to be paid Woolf s supple outsiderism might seem to have worn pretty well But in the partisan 1930s it was dismissed as dotty and vague She sank into depression It didn t help that fiction writing was becoming harder and that war was approaching Given that Woolf s mind was beginning to cloud over again Lee thinks that her decision to kill herself by walking into the Ouse one day in the 1940s was in its way a brave one But it cast a shadow over her life It made her story too readily available to people who wanted to see her as a victim or a crusader or a martyr to art What Lee s biography reveals is much more interesting Woolf devoted herself to literature and believed in the rights of women but both these passions were part of a humbler and therefore grander pursuit Getting down to the essential thing is how she put it when talking about literature Freedom from unreal loyalties is the striking phrase in her late feminist essay Three Guineas In either case the goal was to see life a little more clearly
