 Newsweek to Faludi All Is Forgiven Chatterbox was a bit surprised to see Susan Faludi s forthcoming book Stiffed The Betrayal of the American Man get the red carpet treatment from Newsweek The magazine put Faludi on this week s cover and inside ran a lengthy excerpt with no fewer than four sidebars to read them click here and here and here and here and to top it all off an extremely sympathetic interview with the author Perhaps Chatterbox wouldn t have been so surprised had he known that Faludi recently became a Newsweek contributing editor But that s surprising too Why Because Faludi s hugely successful previous book Backlash was in large part an attack on well Newsweek Backlash is remembered as a broadside against 1980s culture as a whole and to quote its subtitle its undeclared war against American women That culture is represented in Backlash mainly through the news media which if you read the book quickly comes off as uniformly hostile toward feminism But if you take a closer look you ll notice that some news outlets come off worse than others Faludi doesn t make a big deal of this presumably because she never really intended Backlash to be a critique of particular news organizations so much as well a broadside against the culture as a whole That the culture as a whole quickly turned Faludi s book into a runaway best seller has always suggested to Chatterbox that Backlash s thesis was an oversimplification According to Faludi s acknowledgements Backlash began as a story for the San Jose Mercury News s Sunday magazine debunking an unpublished academic study by David Bloom a Harvard economist and Patricia Craig a Yale graduate student purporting to show that never married college educated women faced at age 30 only a 20 percent chance of getting hitched in their lifetimes The findings became famous when they landed on the cover of Newsweek Much of Backlash is dedicated to demolishing both the Bloom Craig research itself and Newsweek s further distortion of it most famously Newsweek s preposterous claim that a single gal was more likely to be killed by a terrorist than to find a mate Faludi writes that a former Newsweek bureau intern who was involved in the story s preparation later explains how the terrorist analogy wound up in the magazine What happened is one of the bureau reporters was going around saying it as a joke like Yeah a woman s more likely to get bumped off by a terrorist and next thing we knew one of the writers in New York took it seriously and it ended up in print Newsweek also gets cuffed about in Backlash for decrying the emotional fallout of feminism for hyping cocooning a trend pretty much invented by Faith Popcorn for attacking the myth of Supermom for running two covers on the trend of childlessness and for exaggerating the problem of drug addiction among pregnant mothers among other sins In many instances Faludi s digs at Newsweek are actually somewhat unfair The conflict between women s traditional motherhood role and their increased participation in the workplace isn t just something dreamed up by newsmagazine writers But that isn t the point The point is that an implicit theme running throughout Backlash is that in a world plagued by stupid superficial journalism Newsweek is stupider and more superficial than most print outlets That doesn t make Faludi a hypocrite for becoming a contributing editor at Newsweek Even if she thinks the magazine is no better now than it was in the 1980s she probably figures she ll help it improve But look at this week s Faludimania cover package from Newsweek s point of view They re heaping laurels onto someone who s called them a bunch of sexist ninnies Is this an admirable show of open mindedness a pathetic demonstration of low self esteem or inevitable mindless worship of whatever is hot Perhaps a bit of each
