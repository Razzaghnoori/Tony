 you said you have four cats yes i have four cats how old are they about well they range from let s see about a year and a half to nine years old oh gosh yes i haven t had my oldest one quite nine years i ve had him probably five years yeah oh okay get so attached to them oh yes i love my cats i lost one one time uh the first one i got he jumped off the balcony actually of a second story apartment and he d never been outside like you know by himself outside oh oh no uh huh and it started raining and i was hysterical i was i mean you would have thought a child had died i called everyone i knew i had every friend i knew in the apartment searching for this cat and they laughed at me they thought that was so hysterical yeah um hum yes i understand oh no i understand we have uh we ve gone through the same thing with ours we ve cut you know they ve been ill i mean i take off work to take care of my cats you know the my boss thinks i m absolutely crazy oh yeah and then we had a baby and its like all right who comes first the cat or the baby right the cat was here first so i know it s hard and and then when we go to sleep at night you know it s like uh my husband and i have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us it s like all right whose corners is this one oh how funny that s sweet i have the two the other two cats i have are outdoor cats oh uh huh and they didn t used to be actually but they got kind of wild and weren t doing very well inside so i put them outside once i got a house and they re doing great out there they love it but the other one the first one i got he doesn t want anything to do with outside unless you re there oh uh huh other than that he gets scared to death if you shut that door he goes into hiding oh no i think it s from the time he jumped off the balcony and lord knows what happened to him yes uh huh that s it but he s probably been through all kinds of nightmares right traumatized for life here probably oh yeah we ve all four of ours are house cats we started out with two with two outdoor cats but our neighbor decided he didn t like cats and shot one of them are they oh no oh well he lived through it oh i couldn t believe it we went through like twenty two hundred dollars worth of vet bills the the cat almost died and but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat oh he loves life now oh my gosh uh i imagine and he s like oh thank you so much i wonder how many of his lives he missed when that happened i know we wondered about that but uh oh that was a traumatic experience for us too oh oh i can imagine what did he shoot him with uh well uh from what we can tell it was a pellet gun and then he started chasing him with a bull whip oh oh my gosh oh yes it was absolutely nuts uh but uh luckily enough you know we found the cat in time and uh rushed him to the vet and it took us about six weeks people are crazy oh Lord of in and out of the vet and surgery and today i mean he started off as a stray and then we did all this for him oh man but oh they he s been a wonderful cat i imagine they usually are after something like that happens to them it just seems to mellow them or something oh yes but uh we wouldn t have we wouldn t have them i mean i don t see us without pets without cats there s just uh there s this they just fill this void no oh yeah i kept i keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because i feel like i don t i can t take care of them as well because they re outside and it worries me that one day one of them won t come back and uh huh yes i feel like they need a big home a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things but i can t give them up i just i go hysterical when they don t come home oh just oh no right and you worry about oh who s taking care of them you know oh yeah and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat and you go crazy thinking it might be yours uh huh uh right well i didn t realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until i brought one home one night we we i had one that had we had we had to put to sleep he got so sick and uh well i fell in love with this uh it s a Chinchilla Persian and uh brought him home and uh huh ooh oh my husband just died it was like we can t take it back you ve got we ve got to keep it now really well it s here now we have to keep it yeah my my first one that i got i had just moved away from home and got my own apartment and it took me about two weeks to realize that was real lonely so i found this one uh huh um hum yes in a actually it was on a sign at Taco Bell drive thru that said free kittens and i thought well that s interesting i ll call them and he was the only one left and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she d gotten all her kittens oh uh huh uh right oh uh huh and he was the last one she carried across you know the whole big sad story so of course i had to take him i felt so sorry for him after that and he is uh you can tell he was weaned too young because he ll nurse on your ears and your fingers oh right right oh no yeah he i asked the vet why he did that and he said he was probably weaned too young which he was because his mom was killed so but he is the lovingest cat everybody people who don t even like cats like him yeah oh he never meows he he doesn t have any front claws i had him declawed but he doesn t bite anybody he s just he s just kind of there real friendly and docile oh uh huh oh that s good oh we just uh just love them they uh you know get to feeling so lovey and dovey and they ll come up and just start kneading in our chest and it s like oh your claws need trimming oh yeah yeah we do we call that doing biscuits it looks like their kneading bread oh yes yes oh it just drives us nuts oh i just love cats i like dogs they re okay i had i had a dog when i lived at home but they re a lot more trouble than cats actually um yeah they really are the cats are so independent and they have so much more personality than a dog oh yeah oh yeah they do and but oh they re so much fun to watch them play it s just just hysterical oh they are i love it it s so funny to get more than one cat together because it brings out their personalities and they just act so funny yes oh we ve got uh well the two that were outside they re like brothers i mean i ve never seen two cats so close and uh they uh will get to playing chase through the house and it is hysterical i mean and then the other two cats w ill follow in suit
