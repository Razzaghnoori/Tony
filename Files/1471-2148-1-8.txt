                    Background        The determination of multiple complete genome sequences        of bacteria archaea and eukaryotes has created the        opportunity for a new level of phylogenetic analysis that        is based not on a phylogenetic tree for selected molecules        for example rRNAs as in traditional molecular        phylogenetic studies      but ideally on the entire        body of information contained in the genomes The most        straightforward version of this type of analysis to which        we hereinafter refer to as genometree building involves        scalingup the traditional treebuilding approach and        analyzing the phylogenetic trees for multiple gene families        in principle all families represented in many genomes        in an attempt to derive a consensus organismal phylogeny              However because of the wide spread of        horizontal gene transfer and lineagespecific gene loss at        least in the prokaryotic world comparison of trees for        different families and consensus derivation may become        highly problematic      Probably due to all these        problems a pessimistic conclusion has been reached that        prokaryotic phylogeny might not be reconstructable from        protein sequences at least with current phylogenetic        methods            With the complete genome sequences at hand it appears        natural to seek for alternatives to traditional        alignmentbased treebuilding in the form of integral        characteristics of the evolutionary process Probably the        most obvious of such characteristics is the        presenceabsence of representatives of the analyzed species        in orthologous groups of genes and recently at least        three groups have employed this approach to build genome        trees primarily for prokaryotes       An        alternative way to construct a genome tree involves using        the mean or median level of similarity among all detectable        pairs of orthologs as the measure of the evolutionary        distance between species     Yet another possibility        involves building species trees by comparing gene orders        This approach had been pioneered in the classical work of        Dobzhansky and Sturtevant who used inversions in         Drosophila chromosomes to construct        an evolutionary tree     Subsequently mathematical        methods have been developed to calculate rearrangement        distances between genomes and using these phylogenetic        trees have been built for certain small genomes such as        plant mitochondria and herpesviruses      These        approaches however are applicable only to genomes that        show significant conservation of global gene order which        is manifestly not the case among prokaryotes              Even relatively close species such as for example         Escherichia coli and         Haemophilus influenzae two species        of the subdivision of Proteobacteria retain very little        conservation of gene order beyond the operon level        typically twotofour genes in a row and essentially        none is detectable among evolutionarily distant bacteria        and archaea       Very few operons primarily        those coding for physically interacting subunits of        multiprotein complexes such as certain ribosomal proteins        or RNApolymerase subunits are conserved across a wide        range of prokaryotic lineages      On the other        hand pairwise comparisons of even distantly related        prokaryotic genomes reveal considerable number of shared        predicted operons which creates an opportunity for a        meaningful comparative analysis                The critical issue with all these approaches to genome        tree building is to what extent each of them reflects        phylogeny and to what extent they are affected by other        evolutionary processes such as lineagespecific gene loss        and horizontal gene transfer Comparative analyses have        strongly suggested that these phenomena make major        contributions to genome evolution at least in prokaryotes                These phenomena have the potential to        severely affecting phylogenetic tree topology particularly        when similar sets of genes are lost indifferent lineages        because of similar environmental pressures or when a        preferential trend of horizontal gene flow exists between        different lineages The possibility even has been discussed        that the amount of lateral gene exchange is such that it        invalidates the very principle of representing the        evolution of species as a tree instead the only adequate        representation of evolutionary history could be a complex        network        Genometrees seem to be the last        resort for the species tree concept Unless phylogenetic        signal can be revealed by at least some approaches based on        genomewide comparisons the conclusion seems imminent that        this concept should be abandoned and replaced by a more        complex representation of evolution        Here we compare the topologies produced with five        largely independent approaches to genometree building i        presenceabsence of genomes in Clusters of Orthologous        Groups of proteins COGs ii conservation of local gene        order pairs of adjacent genes among prokaryotic genomes        iii distribution of percent identity between apparent        orthologs iv sequence conservation in concatenated        alignments of ribosomal proteins v comparative analysis        of multiple trees reconstructed for representative protein        families We find that while the presenceabsence approach        is most heavily affected by gene loss and horizontal        transfer the other four methods reveal stronger        phylogenetic signals Although the topologies of the trees        constructed with different approaches were only partially        compatible three previously unnoticed highlevel clades        among bacteria were revealed with notable consistency We        suggest that in spite of all the complexity brought about        by horizontal gene transfer and lineagespecific gene loss        these groups reflect certain evolutionary reality ie the        trajectory of evolution for a relatively stable gene core        It appears that this is the only meaningful way to treat        the notion of a species tree as the history of a        relatively large ensemble of genes not a comprehensive        representation of the history of entire genomes                    Results                  New criteria for genometree construction                      Conserved gene pairs in prokaryotic            genomes            The results of the present analysis of conserved            gene pairs are consistent with the notion of the            fluidity of prokaryotic gene order caused by extensive            recombination Only  invariant genes pairs were            detected all of which consists of genes for ribosomal            proteins and RNA polymerase subunits The remaining             gene pairs were missing in at least one genome            The number of gene pairs represented in three four and            a greater number of genomes decayed rapidly with            highly conserved pairs forming the tail of the            distribution Fig  The  quantile of this            distribution excluding the highly conserved pairs was            found to fit the geometric model with a high            statistical significance Fig  This is compatible            with random independent loss of gene pairs during            evolution suggesting that with the caveat of            horizontal transfer the number of gene pairs shared by            three genomes could reflect the evolutionary distance            between them            The number of conserved gene pairs present in            individual prokaryotic genomes varied from  for             M genitalium to  for             P aeruginosa Table  Analysis            of the cooccurrence of gene pairs among the            prokaryotic genomes shows high values of the Jaquard            coefficient which reflect partial conservation of gene            order see legend to Table  for closely related            species for example  for             E coli and             H influenzae and  for             M thermoautotrophicum and             M jannaschi Table  The value            of this coefficient varied from  to  with a            mean of  for archaea and from  to  with            a mean of  for bacteria In contrast for            archaealbacterial comparisons the values varied from             to  with the average of  Table  These            observations appear to indicate that the distribution            of conserved gene pairs among prokaryotic genomes            carries a phylogenetic signal                                Distributions of identity percentage between            probable orthologs from complete prokaryotic            genomes            Figure shows a sampling of the distributions of            identity percentage between pairs of apparent orthologs            identified as reciprocal best hits from a range of            genome pairs separated by varying phylogenetic            distances Most of the distributions are clearly            unimodal and the distributions for pairs of            phylogenetically distant genomes such as those from            different major bacterial lineages or bacteria versus            archaea have their modes within a relatively narrow            range around  identity Figure             The use of reciprocal best hits is a conservative            way to identify the set of probable orthologs between            pairs of genomes because some of the orthologs are            missed due to complex relationships between groups of            paralogs Nevertheless all genometogenome            comparisons included at least  for the smallest            genomes such as the mycoplasmas and typically a            considerably greater number of protein pairs                and data not shown This suggests that parameters of            the distributions of the similarity level between            probable orthologs identified in this fashion could            potentially serve as useful measures of the            evolutionary distance between genomes                                Genome trees constructed with three different            approaches            Genome trees were generated using the approaches            described under Material and Methods All the trees            showed a clear separation of the two major prokaryotic            domains Bacteria and Archaea Fig    Several            terminal bifurcations that reflect clustering of            relatively close species such as three mycoplasmas              M genitalium M pneumoniae and             U urealiticum  two spirochetes                         B burgdorferi and             T pallidum  and             H pylori and             C jejuni are also reproduced in            all trees Fig    This retention of both the            deepest and the terminal branchings shows that all            types of data used for tree construction contained at            least a crude phylogenetic signal However beyond            these obvious aspects of topology and in particular            with respect to clustering of distantly related            bacteria and archaea the trees produced with different            approaches showed significant differences which appear            to reflect the relative contributions of phenotypic and            phylogenetic signals A quantitative comparison of the            tree topologies using the symmetric distance method            showed that the presenceabsence tree was most            different from the trees made by the other methods            Table                                 Presenceabsence of genomes in COGs            The topology of the parsimony tree built using this            criterion appears to reflect primarily the phenotypes            of the respective organisms Fig  This is most            clearly manifest in the two major bacterial clusters            that appear in this tree each with a strong bootstrap            support            i bacteria with large genomes namely             E coli B subtilis Synechocystis            sp Deinococcus radiodurans and             Mycobacterium tuberculosis and            freeliving bacteria with small genomes             A aeolicus and             T maritima             ii parasites with small genomes mycoplasmas            spirochetes chlamydia and rickettsia            Parasites with moderatesized genomes              H influenzae N            meningitidis and             P multocida H pylori and             C jejuni  formed two distinct            groups Thus wellestablished phylogenetic            relationships between freeliving and parasitic            bacteria such as those within the Proteobacteria              E coliH influenzaeP multocidaN            meningitidis  and within lowGC Grampositive            bacteria              B subtilismycoplasmas  are            not reflected accurately in this tree topology The two            freeliving bacteria with small genomes the            hyperthermophiles             A aeolicus and             T maritima did not join either            the freeliving or the parasitic bacterial cluster            despite their small number of genes similar to that in            bacterial parasites Fig  That these bacteria do            not group with the parasites despite similar genome            sizes suggests that it is not the number of genes per            se but rather the degree of genome degradation and the            loss of coherent sets of genes that affect the topology            of the presenceabsence tree The inclusion of the            parasites             M tuberculosis and             Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the            cluster of bacteria with large genomes probably            reflects the recent origin of parasitism in these            lineages It is further notable that in this tree the            two representative of Crenarchaeota              A pernix and             S solfataricus  do not comprise            a sister group of the Euryarchaeota the remaining            archaeal species but rather for am branch within the            Euryarchaeal cluster see discussion below            In previous studies that employed similar approaches            to genometree building phylogenetically reasonable            clades were observed after a simple omission of            parasitic species      Such an operation could be            applied to the tree shown in Fig  indeed resulting            in the correct recovery of the proteobacterial and            Grampositive bacterial lineages However it seems            that because known natural groups could be reproduced            by this approach only after omission of certain species            on the basis of independent prior knowledge this            method hardly can be useful for delineating new            phylogenetically sound clades                                Conserved gene pairs            The topology of the tree based on gene pair            conservation seems to carry a stronger phylogenetic            signal than the gene presenceabsence tree because it            correctly groups together related freeliving and            parasitic bacteria despite major differences in gene            repertoires Fig  The bacterial side of this tree            consists of three major clades i proteobacterial            clade that in addition to bona fide Proteobacteria            includes also             A aeolicus M tuberculosis D            radiodurans and             Synechocystis sp ii            Grampositive clade that additionally includes             T maritima and iii an            unexpected clade that unites spirochetes and chlamydia            In the archaeal domain the two species of the            Crenarchaeota did not form a clade but instead were            present as separate branches interspersed with            euryarchaeal species To further assess the robustness            of the obtained tree we varied the parameters of the            included conserved pairs by allowing distances between            the genes comprising a pair from  to  and changing            the minimal number of genomes in which a conserved            gene pair had to be present from  to  These changes            did not significantly affect the tree topology data            not shown The topology of a neighborjoining tree            constructed by using the number of gene pairs shared by            two genomes to calculate the evolutionary distance            between them was similar to the topology of the maximum            parsimony tree Table and data not shown            At least some unusual aspects of this trees the            topology could be explained by horizontal transfer of            operons between particular bacterial and archaeal            lineages Specifically it has been noticed previously            that             T maritima shares a considerable            number of genes and operons with Grampositive            bacteria to the exclusion of other bacteria                this seems to be compatible with the position of             T maritima with the            Grampositive cluster Similarly considerable            horizontal gene transfer appear to have occurred            between the             Sulfolobus and             Thermoplasma lineages which            cluster together in the archaeal part of this tree The            presence of extra species in the proteobacterial            cluster is more surprising because no obvious trend for            operon transfer between these bacteria and bona fide            Proteobacteria has been noticed during systematic            genome comparisons however a considerable number of            shared gene pairs was detected during the present            analysis Table  Artifacts of tree construction            could also contribute to these associations In            contrast the spirochetechlamydia clade might reflect            a deep phylogenetic relationship see discussion            below                                Parameters of percent identity distributions            between orthologs            Different characteristics of the distributions of            percent identity between the probable orthologs such            as the mean the median the mode and various            quantiles were used to calculate distances between            genomes and construct phylogenetic trees Trees built            with different cutoff values for symmetrical best            hits four different formulas for the evolutionary            distance calculation see Materials and Methods and            different parameters of the distributions showed            essentially the same topology with strong bootstrap            support for most of the clades Fig and data not            shown The complete proteobacterial and Grampositive            bacterial clusters were recovered in this tree as well            as the unexpected grouping of chlamydia with spirochete            noticed above in the tree based on conserved gene pairs            Fig   Also similarly to the previous two trees            the Crenarchaea grouped with             Thermoplasma within the archaeal            part of the tree Beyond these groupings the tree            appeared conservative in the sense that the unassigned            bacterial species formed separate branches near the            root of the bacterial subtree The closest to the root            were the two hyperthermophilic species             A aeolicus and             T maritima which is compatible            with the standard view of their phylogenetic position                                                Alignmentbased approaches to the construction of            a species tree                          Concatenated alignments of ribosomal              proteins              The alignments of the  ribosomal proteins              conserved in all bacterial and archaeal species were              concatenated headtotail and treated as a single              alignment containing  columns The underlying              assumption is that the genes coding for ribosomal              proteins that function as components of a large              macromolecular complex are unlikely to undergo              horizontal transfer which tends to confound              comparisons of the tree topologies for other protein              families and would invalidate the concatenation              approach The resulting maximumlikelihood tree              contains the complete proteobacterial and              Grampositive bacterial clusters as well as the              spirochetechlamydia cluster noticed in the              genometrees In addition to the              spirocheteschlamydia clade the following              nontrivial affinities were detected with strong              bootstrap support i a cluster of the two              hyperthemophiles               A aeolicus and T              maritima ii a cluster including               D radiodurans Synechocystis and              M tuberculosis which at a deeper level joined              the Grampositive bacterial branch Fig  Similar              tree topologies were obtained when the ribosomal              protein data were analyzed using the neighborjoining              method and when bacterial phylogeny was analyzed              separately by using a concatenated alignments of               ribosomal proteins shared by all bacteria data not              shown Notably in the quantitative comparison of              tree topologies the tree made of concatenated              ribosomal protein alignments showed the closest              similarity to the genometree based on the              distributions of percent identity between orthologs              Table               The reliability of the observed nontrivial              groupings was further examined by using a maximum              likelihood approach the KishinoHasegawa test For              each clade usually species forming the group to be              tested trees with alternative topologies were              manually constructed by joining the clade in question              to every other major group in the tree For example              to assess the support for the spirocheteschlamydia              grouping spirochetes were placed sequentially with                            Thermotoga Aquifex the               ThermotogaAquifex branch              proteobacteria the proteobacterial branch              Proteobacteria the                             DeinococcusSynechocystisMycobacterium cluster              the low GC Grampositive cluster the branch that              unites the latter two clusters and between bacteria              and archaea to the bacterial root The same              alternatives were tested for chlamydia Alternative              topologies were compared either directly using the              ProtML program or were subjected to local              rearrangement first In cases when the topology did              not revert to the original one the final              optimized topology was used for the comparison              These tests showed high stability of the               ThermotogaAquifex and                             DeinococcusSynechocystisMycobacterium groupings              no competing topologies with likelihood within  SD              unit from the original Fig   Table                  The affinity of the                             DeinococcusSynechocystisMycobacterium with              Grampositive bacteria also was supported although              an alternative topology with this cluster joining              Proteobacteria could not be ruled out Fig  Table               Assessment of the spirochetechlamydia grouping              revealed two competing topologies albeit unusual              ones Specifically moving proteobacteria from the              proteobacterial branch to the spirochete branch or              alternatively moving spirochetes with              proteobacteria and simultaneously moving chlamydia              to the bacterial root results in statistically              acceptable topologies Fig  Table   Also a              minor rearrangement of the topology within the              euryarchaeal branch allowed for a reasonable              alternative to the topology in Fig euryarchaeal              paraphyly with the CrenarchaeaEuryarchaea              radiation at the archaeal root Fig  Table                                                    A census of protein families              Another approach to the species tree problem              involves analysis of phylogenetic trees for as many              individual protein families as possible in an              attempt to identify a prevailing topology or at least              common phylogenetic patterns A survey of the COG              data set identified  COGs each of which included              a large number of bacterial and archaeal species but              no or few paralogs and thus appeared to be amenable              to a largescale phylogenetic analysis Table               Maximumlikelihood trees were constructed for each of              these COGs and a breakdown of nearest neighbors was              derived for species and groups involved in each of              the nontrivial or questionable branchings discussed              above                Crenarchaea Thermotoga Aquifex              Deinococcus Mycobacterium              Synechocystis spirochetes chlamydia and              proteobacteria In each case a wide spread of              topologies was observed but the grouping that is              observed in the concatenated ribosomal proteins tree              was encountered most often although for example              for the spirochetechlamydia cluster the lead over              other topologies was slim Fig                                                     Discussion and Conclusions        The trees constructed with each of the four approaches        employed here reflect both the phylogenetic signal and the        phenotypic life style similarities or differences between        organisms but the relative contributions of these two        types of information appear to differ substantially The        gene presenceabsence analysis seemed to be dominated by        the phenotypic signal primarily that from gene loss The        tree based on conserved gene pairs appeared to combine        phylogenetic information with major effects of horizontal        transfer of operons In contrast the trees based on the        distributions of the identity level of orthologs appear to        be more meaningful phylogenetically as indicated by the        recovery of established highlevel phylogenetic groups of        bacteria such as Proteobacteria and Grampositive        bacteria The ability to correctly identify these major        bacterial subdivisions and the absence of obviously wrong        groupings confer credibility to nontrivial clades present        in these trees in particular the spirochetechlamydia        clade The same logic applied to the tree made of        concatenated ribosomal protein sequences which included        two other nontrivial bacterial groupings         AquifexThermotoga and                 SynechocystisMycobacteriumDeinococcus the latter        joining the Grampositive branch Furthermore extensive        testing of alternative topologies using the        KishinoHasegawa test largely supported these new bacterial        branches The nature of this support becomes clearer when        one examines the results of the protein family census Each        of the potential new clades was indeed most common among        the observed topologies but in no case was the excess of        this topology overwhelming Taken together these results        seem to shed light on the very notion of a species tree        It appears that at best a species tree can be viewed as a        prevailing phylogenetic trend which as far as deep        branchings are concerned may not even apply to a majority        of the genes in a genome        The potential new deep relationships between bacterial        lineages revealed during this analysis should be considered        preliminary and treated with caution Nevertheless an        evolutionary affinity between Cyanobacteria          Synechocystis  and Actinomycetes          Mycobacterium  appears plausible        particularly given the presence in these bacterial groups        of welldeveloped and partly similar signal transduction        systems     The connection between two        hyperthermophilic bacteria         Aquifex and         Thermotoga also has obvious        biological meaning although in this case particular        caution is due given the possibility of preferential        horizontal gene exchange between these organisms that        inhabit similar environments However the strong support        for this grouping obtained in the analysis of concatenated        ribosomal proteins argues against horizontal transfer as        the primary cause for the observed topology Although        recent studies on the phylogeny of ribosomal proteins        suggest some horizontal transfer events these seem to be        largely restricted to bacteriaspecific ribosomal proteins        In the universal set of ribosomal proteins only one S        showed clear signs of horizontal transfer     The        potential deep phylogenetic connections uncovered during        this analysis call for detailed genome comparisons in        search of potential shared derived characters such as        unique protein domain architectures that could support the        new clades        The major bacterial lineages are poorly resolved in        rRNAbased trees     and those built using alignments        of RNA polymerase subunits    and translation        elongation factors      In the currently accepted        taxonomy which is based primarily but not exclusively on        S RNA phylogenetic analysis bacterial lineages that are        suggested by this analysis to form higherlevel clusters        tend to form primary nodes under Bacteria Chlamydiales        Spirochetales Cyanobacteria the         ThermusDeinococcus group        Aquificales Thermotogales Thus the genome trees        primarily suggest however tentatively new unifications        based on deep phylogenetic connections rather than split        already established clades A notable exception is the        traditional unification of Actinomycetes or High GC        grampositive bacteria represented here by         Mycobacterium  with low GC        Grampositive bacteria the         BacillusClostridium group under        Firmicutes Grampositive bacteria Such a connection was        not supported by any of the trees analyzed here and it is        also poorly if at all supported by the latest consensus        trees for S RNA  S RNA and translation factor EFTu            Therefore it seems likely that the Firmicutes clade        at least in its present composition does not exist The        new clade that might replace it consists of lowGC        Grampositive bacteria and the potential        ActinomycetesDeinococcalesCyanobacteria group Fig         All methods of tree analysis applied here also challenge        the traditional division of the archaeal kingdom into        Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota suggesting instead that        Euryarchaeota could be a paraphyletic group with respect to        Crenarchaeota or in other words that Crenarchaeota might        have evolved from within the Euryarchaeota However the        existence of a statistically supported alternative        topology with a sistergroup relationship between        Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota allows for the possibility        that the apparent paraphyly of Euryarchaea is an artifact        caused by rapid evolution in some Euryarchaeal lineages        such as         Halobacterium and         Thermoplasma         An independent phylogenetic study of concatenated        ribosomal proteins has been recently published     The        main specific conclusion reported in this study was the        apparent association of         Synechocystis with Grampositive        bacteria although instability of the tree topology        dependent on the subset of sites used for analysis was        noticed Another recent study addressed the issue of a        global tree through phylogenetic analysis of         concatenated sets of orthologous proteins for which no        strong evidence of horizontal transfer was available            Notably some of the unexpected groupings within the        bacterial domain reported in this study coincide or overlap        with those described here namely a spirochetechlamydial        clade and a DeinococcalesCyanobacteria clade The grouping        of the latter clade with Actinomycetes the unification of        the DeinococcalesCyanobacteriaActinomycetes clade with        Grampositive bacteria and the grouping of the two        bacterial hyperthermophiles were not reproduced in the work        of Brown and coworkers The differences between the        results of the two studies could owe to the differences        between data sets analyzed the methods used or most        likely both We should note that the present study engaged        a substantially broader data set and more diverse methods        for tree construction We believe however that in terms        of the potential contribution of genomewide phylogenetic        analysis to phylogenetic taxonomy the areas where        different methods and independent analyses by different        groups converge might be more important than the areas of        discrepancy It appears that potential new clades revealed        in such independent studies are strong candidates for new        highlevel taxa        The results of the present study suggest that genome        trees based on new integral criteria do not provide        substantial advantages in phylogenetic reconstruction over        more traditional alignmentbased methods expanded to the        genomic scale In fact the latter seem to be more        sensitive in detecting potential deep evolutionary        relationships and this is expected to further improve with        the increasing number of completely sequenced genomes        becoming available for analysis We believe however that        this conclusion does not necessarily indicate that genome        trees such as those based on representation of genomes in        orthologous sets or conservation of gene pairs are        useless In addition to revealing some new phylogenetic        affinities they are capable of alerting researchers to        other evolutionary phenomena such as loss of similar gene        sets in different organisms and preferential horizontal        gene exchange between certain lineages                    Material and Methods                  Sequence data          The sequences of the proteins encoded in complete          genomes were extracted from the Genome division of

     conserved gene pairs in prokaryotic genomes            The database of Clusters of Orthologous Groups of            proteins COGs was used as the source of information            on orthologous genes in prokaryotic genomes                 Briefly the COGs were constructed from the results of            allagainstall BLAST    comparison of proteins            encoded in complete genomes by detecting consistent            groups of genomespecific best hits BeTs The COG            construction procedure does not rely on any            preconceived phylogenetic tree of the included species            except that certain obviously related genomes for            example two species of mycoplasmas or pyrococci were            grouped prior to the analysis to eliminate strong            dependence between BeTs In order to avoid spurious            occurrence of the same gene pair only gene pairs            conserved in three or more genomes were considered A            pair of genes from two COGs was considered to be            conserved if the respective genes were adjacent in at            least one genome and were separated by no more than two            genes in at least two additional genomes This relaxed            definition of a conserved gene pair was adopted to take            into account the high level of recombination in            prokaryotic genomes From the data on the            presenceabsence of each conserved gene pair in the            analyzed genomes excluding pairs of closely related            species             E coliBuchnera sp H

analogous to the one used            for the presenceabsence of individual genes was            constructed and a tree was built using Dollo parsimony                A parsimony method was chosen for this            analysis because the presenceabsence of a conserved            gene pair in a genome can be naturally treated in terms            of character states The Dollo model is based on the            assumption that each derived character state in this            case the presence of a gene pair originates only            once and homoplasies exist only in the form of            reversals to the ancestral condition absence of a gene            pair     In other words parallel or convergent            gains of the derived condition are assumed to be highly            unlikely The Dollo parsimony method is not sensitive            to gene loss which is extremely common in evolution of            prokaryotes but the results can be affected by            independent acquisition of the same gene pair by            different genome via horizontal gene transfer            Phylogenetic analysis was performed by using the PAUP             program     with  bootstrap replicates            performed to assess the reliability of the tree            topology In addition the tree topology was analyzed            using the neighborjoining method                                    Parsimony trees based on the representation of            genomes in orthologous gene sets            The information on orthologous genes in prokaryotic            genomes and the yeast genome was derived from the COGs            as in the previous approach and the orthology data            were similarly represented as a  matrix of            presenceabsence of the analyzed genomes in the COGs A            Dollo parsimony tree was constructed and the            reliability of its topology was assessed using the            bootstrap method as described above                                Distance trees based on distributions of identity            percentage between orthologous protein sequences            The sequences of all proteins encoded in the            analyzed genomes were compared to each other using the            gapped BLASTP program     Reciprocal            genomespecific BeTs were collected at different            expectation E value cutoffs                This method for identification of probable            orthologs is in principle similar to the method            employed in COG construction but differs in that there            is no requirement for the formation of triangles of            consistent BeTs The result of this procedure is a            conservative selection of orthologous pairs because the            cases of lineagespecific duplication that result in            nonsymmetrical BeTs are excluded and so are            orthologous pairs with very low sequence similarity            However the limitation of the COG system namely the            requirement that each orthologous group is represented            in at least three genomes is avoided The            distributions of identity percentage among the            reciprocal best hits were derived for each pair of            species The mean mode median and different quantiles            of the identity percentage distributions were used for            estimating evolutionary distances Four distance            measures were used namely i Pdistances calculated            as the fraction of different residues             d               q ii Poisson distances             d  n             u iii geometric distances            calculated using the formula             d               u  and iv logarithmic            distances found as a solution of the equation             u  ln             d              d  where             d is the evolutionary distance             q is percent identity and             u               q                     Trees were constructed from the distance matrices            obtained with the above distance estimates using the            neighborjoining method    as implemented in the            NEIGHBOR program of the PHYLIP package                Bootstrap values were estimated by resampling the set            of orthologs identified for each pair of genomes             times and reconstructing trees from the distributions            of the distances from these resampled sets                                Maximum Likelihood trees based on concatenated            alignments of ribosomal proteins            Sets of orthologous ribosomal proteins were            extracted from the COG database and their amino acid            sequences were aligned using the TCoffee program                with subsequent manual validation and removal of            poorly aligned regions The alignments are available            upon request Pairwise evolutionary distances between            the sequences in concatenated alignments were            calculated using the Dayhoff PAM model as implemented            in the PROTDIST program of the PHYLIP package                A distance tree was constructed from the resulting            distance matrix by using the leastsquare    method            as implemented in the FITCH program of PHYLIP                The maximum likelihood tree was constructed with the            JTTF model of amino acid substitutions     as            implemented in the ProtML program of the MOLPHY package                by optimizing the least squares tree with            local rearrangements Alternative topologies were            created manually by modifications of the original tree            and directly compared by ProtML Bootstrap analysis was            performed by using the Resampling of Estimated            LogLikelihoods RELL method as implemented in ProtML                                                Comparative analysis of Maximum Likelihood trees            for individual protein families            The representative families were selected from the            COG database according to the following criteria i at            least  species are represented ii no more than two            paralogs in any of the species iii no more than             paralogs per genome on average iv at least             positions in the alignment containing less than  of            gaps This selection procedure resulted in a set of             families COGs Alignments and ML trees were            constructed for these families as described above for            the concatenated ribosomal proteins                                Quantitative comparison of tree topologies            To compare tree topologies quantitatively the            symmetric distance between trees    was computed            using the TREEDIST program of the PHYLIP package            version a Briefly each of the two compared trees            is divided by each internal branch into two partitions            The symmetric distance is the number of partitions that            are found in one tree but not the other
