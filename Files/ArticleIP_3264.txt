 False Notes It was a disconcerting experience waiting to enter the theater to see One True Thing The earlier screening was ending and out came one woman after another with tears streaming down her face or eyes bloodshot from weeping I cried during the first scene and never stopped crying said one to another then joined the long line for the ladies room Later watching the movie I found myself nearly sobbing too except from boredom One True Thing isn t a snickerfest like Beaches 1988 and it isn t as emotionally pornographic as parts of last year s As Good as It Gets It s pretty much inert But my benumbed responses don t account for all those weepers leaving the theater or for the snuffling and nose blowing I heard during my own screening No the movie s themes are enormously resonant which makes its doddering tastefulness that much more frustrating One True Thing is based on a decent understated novel by Anna Quindlen the story of Ellen Gulden an ambitious young magazine writer who moves from Manhattan back to her small hometown to care for her cancer ridden mother Never close to this unassuming homemaker Ellen returns reluctantly at the behest of her father mentor an imposing professor of literature at a small middling college who maintains that he s too busy to tend to his wife In the course of the book Ellen learns that her father s life while ostensibly rich in literary philosophical meaning is a sham while the real meaning and bravery can be found in her mother s household and community rituals and in how she faces death In the last 100 pages Ellen goes on trial for her mother s mercy killing and only then manages to remove herself with bitterness from her father s constellation The film directed by Carl Franklin from a script by Karen Croner throws most of its weight onto the mother daughter relationship which wouldn t be a problem if Croner knew how to dramatize it The novel includes a scene in which the mother Kate is too weak to prepare an elaborate luncheon for a group of women so her daughter dons the apron and under Kate s direction cooks a successful meal In the movie Kate Meryl Streep passes out on the sofa while Ellen Ren e Zellweger comically botches whatever she touches and Franklin goes for cheap laughs with shots of burning chicken paillards a smoldering chocolate cake and plates on which the food has been left uneaten Think of the possibilities in Quindlen s original the rapport that might have developed as Ellen saut s and mixes and bakes and Kate offers her expertise That could have been the core of the picture right there and Franklin and Croner toss it into the trash When later the newly domesticated Ellen whips up a masterful Thanksgiving dinner her skills have arrived out of nowhere One True Thing taps into the same yearnings as Field of Dreams 1989 only for mothers and daughters instead of fathers and sons That earlier work impossibly fraudulent on every level dramatized the ways in which baby boomers who came of age with the counterculture rejected their daddies along with their daddies conservative values only to be left with an emptiness filled only by gulp a supernatural baseball game One True Thing doesn t employ fantasy at least not overtly but tries to stir similar regrets about the feminist dismissal of housewives You moved to New York and the heartless magazine world you dressed in black you rejected Mom But look how you barely knew her How she held your home together Look at how it was her not otherwise engaged Dad who gave your life its true foundation This foundation is embodied by Streep who might be the biggest reason the film goes wrong The central fact of Kate is that she s an invisible woman always taken for granted in the background doing things but never really registering Employing an accent that s straight out of Fargo Streep clucks and flutters and sighs and acts so ostentatiously industrious that it s hard to imagine anyone not noticing or not wanting to bludgeon her Kate is a character whose face you should want to scrutinize for hints of a larger awareness but I found it hard to look at Streep who s always busy radiating virtue Later ash faced with cancer she s paradoxically easier to watch she does less and she hits some convincing notes of pain But when she finds her tongue and protests the injustices of literature in which clever girls are always depicted as superior to merely good ones she s pathetically unconvincing The dots remain unconnected As her husband William Hurt is an expert at appearing to think deep thoughts but the character s groggy pretentiousness and the actor s merge uncomfortably Hurt plays George from the movie s point of view instead of the character s The professor s self absorption and obliviousness are so apparent from the start that it s a wonder he could ever have fooled anyone Franklin a director of marvelous thrillers such as One False Move 1991 and Devil in a Blue Dress 1995 and of the intricate HBO miniseries Laurel Avenue 1993 must have taken on this project to prove that an African American filmmaker can bring a fresh perspective to the white bread tale of mothers and daughters in snowy New England He does bring his customary leisurely pacing and attention to place especially in the lovingly coordinated flowers flowered wallpaper chintz family homestead What he doesn t provide is a pulse The film unfolds in flashbacks as Ellen is interviewed by a district attorney about the circumstances of her mother s death but the framing device doesn t generate any suspense and the linking scenes are so clumsily overwritten that the woman might be talking to her therapist What holds the film together is Zellweger s Ellen and not because of anything she does but because she s the only major player who seems to be listening I first saw Zellweger as a hot pants hell raiser in a miserable Tarantino knockoff called Love and a 45 1994 She was exuberant as she was in her star making turn in Jerry Maguire 1996 and in the same year s superb largely overlooked drama The Whole Wide World Unlike Streep she slips easily into her roles revealing her disparate characters not through epidemic tics but in how she reacts to the people around her Through her eyes even Streep looks halfway human So why do people cry at One True Thing It might be that even an ordinary relationship between a mother and daughter is so fraught with so much left unspoken that any film that hammers so relentlessly on that spot will hit a nerve It might be too that Franklin s unhurried tempos give us plenty of time to look back on our own lives and loved ones and to think about the people whose labors we didn t register until they were gone One True Thing prompted me to call my mom when I got home Of course AT T commercials do that too and they get the same point across in under a minute In Pecker John Waters seems to wonder aloud if you can ever go home again especially when your success like his own has transformed that home from something authentically tacky into something ironically chic His eponymous hero Edward Furlong is a boyish happy go lucky Baltimore photographer whose pictures of urban grotesques from fornicating rodents to lesbian strippers to homeless exhibitionists renders them objects of beauty and wonderment Acclaimed as a humane Diane Arbus by a New York gallery owner Lili Taylor and assorted pompous critics and collectors Pecker finds his haunts suddenly withering under the attention his subjects demanding model fees and his girlfriend Christina Ricci the compulsively by the book proprietor of a laundromat fleeing his wealthy new cohorts for the safety of her suds This is the subversively lovable Waters of Hairspray 1988 rather than the in your face deformity maven of Pink Flamingos 1972 and the more mainstream Cry Baby 1990 and Serial Mom 1994 Pecker is a breezy agreeable picture a charmer thumbs up three stars but there s something disappointing about a John Waters film that s so evenhanded and all embracing even if its sunniness is ironic Waters seems to be trapped in an ironic loop making movies that look more and more like love ins in which name actors go slumming and people like Patty Hearst show up for nudge nudge wink wink cameos He must know that no one can be shocked when everyone s in on the joke but he doesn t seem to want or to be able to step outside the camp aesthetic and play anything straight There s nothing in Pecker that isn t done more brilliantly and more subversively every week on Mike Judge s inspired cartoon series King of the Hill Rush Hour the first real Jackie Chan picture crafted for the American market is a terrific piece of junk filmmaking The plot is by the numbers and you can t help but notice that Chan has more stunt doubles these days but the movie has been photographed by veteran Adam Greenberg and staged by director Brett Ratner with unusual polish and Chan has been paired with the black comedian Chris Tucker who s like Eddie Murphy on helium Tucker can be trying when the script isn t good but he s a great foil for Chan physically gung ho and with supersonic timing The young daughter of the Chinese consul is kidnapped and Chan is summoned from Hong Kong to Los Angeles where FBI agents saddle him with wild man L A cop Tucker My own mama ashamed of me she tell everyone I m a drug dealer to keep him out of their way Of course the pair ends up in the middle of every conflagration The fights are riotous slapstick set pieces In the art museum finale Chan fends off hordes of assassins while catching giant priceless Ming vases as they tumble from their pedestals As he demonstrates in picture after picture he s willing to be stomped for art s sake
