 Background The United States began to implement a national plan to immunize half a million hospital based healthcare workers against smallpox in early 2003 Prospective vaccinees are healthcare workers in emergency departments intensive care units and other settings who would be crucial first line responders in the event of a bioterrorist attack using smallpox However vaccination is voluntary and many staff members are declining In Israel almost half of healthcare workers and security and rescue squad personnel refused voluntary smallpox vaccination in 2002 due to concerns about vaccine adverse events according to one press report 1 In early December 2002 just before the current smallpox vaccination plan was announced we carried out a survey of U S healthcare workers opinions about smallpox vaccination in order to inform preparedness efforts Although much has happened to change public opinion since that time our findings provide insight into factors that influence the ongoing decision making of healthcare workers about this vaccine Methods Study Sample We surveyed a convenience sample of healthcare workers at 21 of 22 invited acute care hospitals in 10 states between December 2 and 18 2002 to determine their knowledge attitudes and projected behavior regarding smallpox vaccination All but one of the hospitals were members of the Prevention Epicenters established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC or the Duke Infection Control Outreach Network DICON The hospitals were located in Massachusetts 8 North Carolina 3 Maryland 2 Virginia 2 and Georgia New York Missouri Illinois Iowa and Oregon 1 each The population of interest for the survey was emergency department ED and intensive care unit ICU staff although surveys were also completed by limited numbers of other staff e g radiology technicians who might plausibly be involved in a smallpox admission Of the 1 443 surveys distributed to staff 1 165 were completed within the required time frame for a response rate of 81 Procedures The hospital epidemiologists or infection control practitioners obtained institutional review board IRB approval or in some cases exemption from review and administered the survey to their hospital s ED and ICU staff Collaborators agreed to return a minimum of 25 completed surveys to the study investigators by December 20 2002 The self administered survey was anonymous confidential and voluntary It was distributed during staff meetings or in person on an individual basis or occasionally via mailboxes A draft smallpox vaccine information sheet CDC s 11 20 2002 version see Additional File 1 was placed inside each folded questionnaire The draft information sheet did not include photographs of adverse reactions nor did it describe the inflammatory response at immunization site that occurs among a substantial fraction of individuals At 16 of the 21 hospitals a good quality pen was handed out with each survey at another small gift certificates were used the remaining 4 hospitals did not employ gifts The completed surveys were collected at each site by the collaborator who also tracked the total number of surveys that had been distributed Survey instrument The questionnaire see Additional File 2 consisted of 17 multiple choice questions mostly about respondents attitudes and projected behavior regarding smallpox and smallpox vaccination knowledge and topics of concern and self assessed health history relative to smallpox vaccination previous vaccination contraindications A number of questions addressed demographic and occupational characteristics A question at the end of the survey asked how carefully respondents had read the enclosed vaccine information sheet Analysis The main outcome variable was respondents expressed willingness to accept vaccination which was dichotomized as yes probably vs no probably not don t know and then correlated with potential predictors of response individually and by multivariate logistic regression The variables initially included in the model were perceived risk of a smallpox attack region main work area profession age gender presence or absence of children 18 years old at home self assessed previous vaccination status self assessed level of knowledge about smallpox vaccination and how well one had read the vaccine information sheet This list includes all the questions on the questionnaire except those addressing reasoning underlying one s attitude toward vaccination contraindications and projected behavior under hypothetical scenarios These excluded variables were considered irrelevant as predictors or were intractable for inclusion due to the structure of the corresponding questions overall results on them are presented in univariate form without weighting or other adjustment All p values and estimates from the logistic regression analysis and presented in the tables are adjusted for clustering within hospital and for different number of responses per hospital using generalized linear mixed models 2 The data were analyzed in SAS using the NLMIXED procedure A fuller description of the analysis is available on request Results Characteristics of the hospitals and respondents Seventeen of the 21 hospitals were in the Northeast and Mid Atlantic Southeast Table 1 Eleven were tertiary care centers with 69 of the respondents 9 were community hospitals with 27 of the respondents and one was a Veterans Administration hospital with 4 The median number of beds was 427 with a range of 113 to 1 442 Approximately half of respondents worked in the ED or provided consultation to it approximately half were nurses and approximately two thirds were women Table 1 Perceptions of smallpox threat and vaccine risks Fifty three percent of respondents thought the risk of a smallpox attack in the U S within the next two years was either intermediate 38 or high 15 while 35 saw it as either low 29 or next to zero 6 and 12 said can t guess Opinions varied widely among the various hospitals with a range of 27 to 73 per hospital considering the risk of an attack to be intermediate or high p 02 chi square test on crude data Twelve percent of respondents felt they were very well informed about smallpox vaccination 41 felt fairly well informed 39 said not well informed and 8 answered not at all informed Table 1 The topics about which information was most commonly desired were 1 the likelihood and nature of adverse events 28 of the answers chosen 2 the risks and health problems of transmitting vaccinia to others 15 of the answers and 3 the risk of a smallpox attack 15 Table 2 The most frequently chosen top concern about vaccination was the risks compared to the benefits of vaccination 53 followed by the risks of transmitting vaccinia to family or friends 26 Of the different types of adverse events 70 of respondents were most concerned about severe reactions like encephalitis severe infection and death while 18 were more concerned about the more frequent mild to moderate reactions and 11 said they were not particularly worried about vaccine adverse events When asked at the end of the survey how carefully they had read the accompanying vaccine information sheet 47 of respondents said they had read it carefully 16 said they had read parts of it 21 reported skimming it quickly and 17 said they hadn t read it Table 1 Attention to the vaccine information sheet appeared to be associated with one s top concern p 035 chi square test on crude data with for example 30 of those reporting having carefully read it listing transmission of vaccinia to family or friends as their principal concern compared to 17 26 of the groups reading the vaccine information sheet less carefully or not at all Self assessed health history relative to smallpox vaccination Fifty two percent of respondents reported having been previously vaccinated against smallpox 36 said they had not while 12 weren t sure Of those 30 years of age 11 reported having been vaccinated of those 30 23 reported not having been vaccinated Table 2 Six percent reported having a child or children 1 year of age at home currently a precaution rather than a contraindication to smallpox vaccination Forty five percent of those who completed the question on contraindications said either yes 37 or don t know 8 to at least one of the contraindications in our list of 8 The most common self reported contraindication was household member with current or past history of eczema or atopic dermatitis 16 of respondents reported this situation The next most frequent contraindication was current or past history of eczema or atopic dermatitis in oneself reported by 13 Attitudes toward smallpox vaccination In response to the question If you were medically eligible for vaccination and were offered smallpox vaccine today would you choose to be vaccinated 61 of healthcare workers answered yes 32 or probably 29 while the remaining 39 answered probably not 11 6 no 11 6 or don t know 15 7 Attitudes varied by hospital ranging from 17 to 82 of respondents per hospital inclined toward accepting vaccination p 0004 chi square test on crude data In bivariate analyses one s opinion of the risk of a smallpox attack was strongly associated with willingness or desire to be immunized p 0001 with 70 of those perceiving an intermediate high risk of attack and 66 of those without an opinion about the risk being inclined toward vaccination compared to 47 of those seeing the risk as low Table 1 Region other than the Northeast male sex having children 18 years or younger at home being very well informed about the risks and benefits of vaccination and reading the vaccine information sheet were associated with planning to be vaccinated but see caveats in footnote to Table 1 Willingness to be vaccinated was not associated with the demographic variables work area profession or age In multivariate analyses that adjusted for clustering within hospital the number of responses per hospital work area profession and age four variables were associated with willingness to be vaccinated perceived risk of an attack odds ratio OR for high intermediate compared to low perceived risk 3 2 95 CI 2 4 4 2 self assessed knowledge about smallpox vaccination OR for very well compared to not at all informed 2 0 95 CI 1 1 3 7 self assessed previous smallpox vaccination status OR for vaccinated compared to not 1 5 95 CI 1 0 2 1 and gender OR for men 1 4 95 CI 1 1 2 0 Table 3 Region was not associated with attitude toward vaccination in the multivariate analysis Projected behavior under hypothetical post event scenarios Respondents interest in vaccination depended to some extent on geographic proximity of a hypothetical future smallpox case Of those in any doubt about vaccination i e answering anything other than an unqualified yes to the question of whether they would get vaccinated today 30 said they would seek vaccination if a case were laboratory confirmed overseas of the remainder who said no 53 said they would do so if a case were confirmed in the U S a thousand miles away of the remainder 70 said they would seek vaccination if a case were confirmed in their city Those uninterested in getting vaccinated even if a case occurred in their city amounted to at least 9 of the starting group possibly more as there was some drop out over the course of the multi part question When asked if they would report to work if they had not been vaccinated recently and had learned that a patient with smallpox had just been admitted to their facility 32 of respondents said yes while 68 expressed reservations to varying degrees 36 said yes but only if I knew I could get vaccinated on arrival 17 responded probably 5 said probably not and 10 said no Among those answering probably and probably not the most common contingency mentioned was the measures taken to contain prevent transmission of the infection followed by location of the patient relative to oneself Age was a significant factor in willingness to go to work under these conditions 20 of respondents under 30 vs 35 of those 30 or older gave an unconditional yes There were no statistically significant differences among gender or professional strata in this regard Discussion Our findings may explain why smallpox vaccine uptake has been relatively limited during the first several months of the U S national effort as of May 2003 only 7 of the target group of 500 000 health care workers had accepted vaccination In our survey the most commonly cited concern was the risk vs benefit of vaccination followed by the risk of transmitting vaccinia virus These matched the two most frequently chosen topics about which more information was desired for making the decision suggesting that the health related risks of vaccination are paramount considerations for people and ones about which they feel insufficiently informed Liability and compensation were not so important to those contemplating vaccination although these issues may have become more important since then Since that time there have been reports of cardiac problems and deaths shortly after vaccination On the other side of the balance the major factor affecting expressed willingness to be immunized was the perceived threat of bioterrorism Those rating the risk of a bioterrorist attack using smallpox as intermediate or high were more likely to favor vaccination It seems probable that a heightening of concerns about vaccine adverse events relative to the fear of a bioterrorist attack underlies the currently low acceptance of smallpox vaccination There are two likely reasons for the fact that far fewer workers have been vaccinated than the 61 expressing a general willingness and even the 32 stating a clear intention to get vaccinated in our December 2002 survey First well publicized decisions of some hospitals and large unions of healthcare workers in early 2003 not to participate in the program together with the subsequent reports of cardiac problems and deaths following vaccination likely changed the minds of many prospective vaccinees Second social desirability bias tends to cause surveys like this one to overestimate acceptance of vaccination 3 For example at one study hospital only 4 of the 28 respondents who said they intended to be vaccinated in our survey actually accepted the vaccine when shortly thereafter it was offered A limitation of this study was that the group surveyed was not a random sample of the population of interest which has implications for the generalizability of the results However hospitals from several regions of the country were included and the response rate was high 80 including in venues where most members of a particular sub group would have been expected to be present e g staff meetings of ED doctors Moreover our results for healthcare workers are similar to those of random digit dial telephone surveys of the general public also carried out in 2002 4 5 both in the proportions of respondents reporting willingness to be vaccinated and in the perception of risk of a smallpox attack We found wide variation among hospitals in both the proportion of staff expressing a willingness to be immunized and the proportion perceiving a threat of bioterrorist attack Bivariate analyses turned up no pattern with respect to geographic region size of hospital or type of hospital community vs tertiary care It is possible that local effects e g in hospital education programs opinions of hospital authorities the rumor mill are important in healthcare workers decision making at least on this issue Knowledge about smallpox vaccination was one of the factors associated with expressed willingness to be vaccinated but we think it more likely that an intention to get vaccinated leads one to seek more information rather than that greater information leads one to seek vaccination Responses about projected behavior under hypothetical scenarios involving a smallpox release are perhaps not reliable as the level and effect of panic likely cannot be accurately imagined Nonetheless it is worth noting that social desirability bias would tend to overestimate the proportion of people willing to put themselves at risk for the common good Thus the one third of respondents who said without qualification they would come to work unvaccinated in the event of a smallpox admission is likely an overestimate Conclusions We conclude that the success of smallpox vaccination efforts will ultimately depend on the relative weight in people s minds of the risk of vaccine adverse events compared with the risk of being exposed to the disease Although more than half of the group we surveyed thought the likelihood of a bioterrorist smallpox attack was intermediate or high less than 10 of the group slated for vaccination has actually accepted it at this time Unless new information about the threat of a smallpox attack becomes available perceptions of the vaccine s risks will likely continue to drive the ongoing decisions of healthcare workers about this vaccine
