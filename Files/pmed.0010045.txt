 Introduction Dietary and lifestyle changes during the last century have entailed an unprecedented epidemic of obesity and associated metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis 1 Many individuals suffer simultaneously from more than one of these conditions and epidemiological studies in humans as well as studies in animal models suggest that obesity related insulin resistance is a common pathogenic feature 2 Indeed insulin resistance is the keystone of the metabolic syndrome a major cardiovascular risk factor even in the absence of demonstrable glucose intolerance or diabetes 3 Obesity and insulin resistance are strongly associated with systemic markers of inflammation and indeed inflammation may contribute to insulin resistance 4 Similarities and overlap between obesity and inflammatory states are emerging Inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor TNF and interleukin IL 6 are produced by adipocytes as well as by monocytes and macrophages and they circulate at increased levels in individuals with obesity 5 6 Moreover bone marrow derived macrophages home in on adipose tissue in individuals with obesity 7 8 and adipocytes and macrophages may even be interconvertible 9 Furthermore inflammation is increasingly recognized as a major component and predictor of atherosclerotic vascular disease a major clinical consequence of insulin resistance 10 Hence the interrelationships between obesity insulin resistance and atherosclerosis are of great scientific and clinical interest We originally identified and characterized resistin as a circulating mouse adipocyte gene product that is regulated by antidiabetic drugs 11 In rodents resistin is derived exclusively from adipocytes 11 12 circulates at increased levels in obese animals 11 and causes dysregulated hepatic glucose production leading to insulin resistance 13 14 A syntenic gene exists in humans but is expressed at higher levels in monocytes and macrophages than in adipocytes 15 16 raising questions about the relationship between resistin and human metabolic disease Recently several studies have suggested that metabolic abnormalities are associated with polymorphisms in the human resistin gene 17 18 Furthermore several studies though not all have reported increased serum resistin levels in patients with obesity insulin resistance and or type 2 diabetes 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 However the mechanism and importance of increased resistin levels in human metabolic disease are not known Here we show that the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide LPS a potent inflammatory stimulant dramatically increases resistin production by inducing secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF This increase in resistin production is blocked by both aspirin and rosiglitazone drugs that have dual anti inflammatory and insulin sensitizing actions and have been shown to antagonize NF B Indeed activation of NF B is sufficient to induce resistin expression and loss of NF B function abolishes LPS induction of resistin Resistin serum levels are increased dramatically by endotoxemia in humans and correlate with a marker of inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes Thus systemic inflammation leads to increased resistin production and circulating levels in humans The increased level of resistin in humans with obesity is likely an indirect result of elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines characteristic of states of increased adiposity Hence obesity and acute inflammation are both hyperresistinemic states associated with insulin resistance Methods Differentiation

the compound treated group relative to that in the vehicle treated group was expressed as 2 deltadeltaCT in which deltadeltaCT equals the deltaCT of the compound treated group minus the deltaCT of the chosen control group which was normalized to 1 ELISA Resistin concentrations in cell media and human plasma were assessed with a commercially available ELISA Linco Research St Charles Missouri United States and normalized to cell protein The average correlation coefficient for standards using a four parameter fit was 0 99 Intra assay and inter assay coefficients of variance were 4 7 and 9 1

any clinical or laboratory abnormalities participants were admitted to the General Clinical Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania for a 60 h stay Serial blood samples were collected during the 24 h prior to and 24 h following the intravenous administration of human research grade endotoxin obtained from National Institutes of Health Clinical Center reference endotoxin CCRE lots 1 and 2

recruited through the diabetes clinics at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center and the Veterans Affairs Medical Center Philadelphia Pennsylvania to an ongoing study of cardiovascular risk factors in type 2 diabetes The sample was composed of 59 Caucasians and 35 African Americans All participants were evaluated at the University of Pennsylvania General Clinical Research Center in a fasting state at 8 AM The University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol and all participants gave written informed consent The patient population is described in more detail elsewhere 27 Statistical Methods Data are reported as mean and standard error of the mean SEM for continuous variables Because of baseline variation in cell populations between batches of primary human monocytes isolated from multiple donors cell culture experiments were performed in triplicate and data from representative experiments are presented For cell culture experiments with multiple treatments analysis of variance ANOVA was used to test for differences in means across treatment groups When significant global differences were found post hoc t tests were used to compare specific treatment groups to the control Data from the human endotoxemia experiment were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA In the type 2 diabetes study Spearman correlations of plasma levels of resistin with plasma sTNFR2 levels are presented Results Induction of Resistin Gene and Protein Expression by Endotoxin Treatment of Human Macrophages The regulation of resistin expression was studied in primary cultures of human monocytic cells Immediately upon plating of elutriated primary human monocytes resistin gene expression was detectable but highly variable from experiment to experiment data not shown One day after plating resistin gene expression remained detectable at low levels Figure 1A Subjection of the cells to a protocol leading to differentiation along the macrophage lineage led to a modest time dependent enhancement of resistin gene expression Figure 1A In agreement with a previous report 28 treatment of primary macrophages with the endotoxin LPS led to a dramatic dose responsive increase in resistin gene expression Figure 1B We also determined that this effect of LPS was paralleled by an increase in resistin protein secretion into the medium Figure 1C Of note activated mouse peritoneal macrophages harvested after thioglycolate treatment did not express detectable levels of mouse resistin even after treatment with LPS data not shown Endotoxin Induction of Resistin Is Delayed with Respect to TNF Induction of resistin gene expression by LPS exposure of human macrophages began between 6 and 24 h after treatment with peak expression at 24 h Figure 2A This time course of resistin induction was delayed relative to induction of TNF gene expression which was detectable at 2 h and peaked 6 h after LPS exposure Figure 2B The secretion of TNF followed a similar time course Figure 2C By contrast secretion of resistin did not increase until much later more closely following the pattern of the appearance of sTNFR2 a marker of TNF action Figure 2C 29 Endotoxin Induction of Resistin Is Blocked by Immunoneutralization of Multiple Cytokines Resistin gene expression was also induced by TNF treatment of primary human macrophages Figure 3A 28 and resistin secretion increased in parallel Figure 3B Since LPS induction of TNF preceded the increase in resistin see Figure 2C we hypothesized that TNF or a similar cytokine produced early after LPS exposure was responsible for the later induction of resistin Indeed neutralizing antibodies to TNF markedly attenuated the increase in resistin gene expression Figure 3C LPS treatment also induces other cytokines including IL 6 and IL 1 30 and IL 6 induces resistin modestly data not shown 28 Antibodies to IL 6 and IL 1 individually had minor effects on LPS stimulation of resistin Figure 3C However the combination of antibodies to TNF IL 6 and IL 1 markedly attenuated LPS induction of resistin Figure 3C These data clearly show that resistin induction by endotoxin is mediated by a cascade in which the primary event is secretion of inflammatory cytokines that in turn induce resistin Induction of Resistin Is Blocked by Anti Inflammatory Insulin Sensitizing Drugs That Target NF B Mouse resistin produced exclusively by adipocytes is down regulated by antidiabetic thiazolidinediones including rosiglitazone 11 Consistent with an earlier report 16 rosiglitazone down regulated resistin gene expression Figure 4A in LPS stimulated human macrophages Resistin protein secretion was also significantly reduced by rosiglitazone Figure 4B Hence macrophage expression of resistin and its induction by LPS is species specific but down regulation of resistin by thiazolidinedione occurs both in rodents and humans Rosiglitazone has marked anti inflammatory effects on macrophages 31 This led us to examine the effect of aspirin an anti inflammatory compound that targets I B kinase and has insulin sensitizing effects 32 Remarkably aspirin dramatically decreased endotoxin induced resistin expression in a dose dependent manner Figure 4C Both aspirin via I B kinase and rosiglitazone via PPAR inhibit NF B 31 32 which is activated by LPS Indeed treatment of the macrophages with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 which prevents NF B activation 33 abrogated endotoxin induced activation of resistin expression data not shown Moreover treatment of the macrophages with SN50 a cell permeable peptide that specifically prevents activation of NF B by inhibiting its nuclear translocation 34 nearly abolished endotoxin induced activation of resistin expression Figure 4D Thus activation of NF B is required for LPS induction of resistin in human macrophages Furthermore constitutive activation of NF B by adenoviral expression of activated I B kinase was sufficient to induce resistin in primary human macrophages Figure 4E The magnitude of this activation was less than that caused by LPS which is known to also activate MAP kinase MAPK Indeed inhibition of either p42 MAPK by PD98059 or p38 MAPK using SB20358 partially blocked the induction of resistin by LPS Figure 4F Together these results show that NF B activation is necessary and sufficient for resistin induction by LPS with MAPK activation increasing the magnitude of the response LPS Robustly Increases Circulating Resistin Levels in Healthy Humans Next we asked whether our findings from ex vivo studies of human macrophages would translate into in vivo observations in humans Six healthy volunteers were injected with LPS using a protocol similar to that shown to produce insulin resistance 35 Baseline circulating resistin levels were approximately 4 ng ml and remained relatively constant for several hours prior to LPS infusion Figure 5A Remarkably resistin levels rose dramatically because of endotoxemia peaking 8 16 h after LPS administration Figure 5A The time course of hyperresistinemia paralleled the increase in circulating levels of sTNFR2 although the increase in resistin levels was more marked and sustained Figure 5A The increase in resistin protein levels correlated with increased resistin gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells following systemic endotoxemia Figure 5B Circulating Resistin Levels Correlate with the Inflammatory Marker sTNFR2 in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance many of whom are obese have elevated levels of several inflammatory markers including IL 6 TNF and sTNFR2 36 LPS administration has been shown to induce acute insulin resistance in humans 37 Given that LPS infusion increased resistin levels we measured resistin in a cohort of 215 patients with type 2 diabetes Circulating resistin levels were significantly correlated with levels of sTNFR Figure 6A Thus there is an association between resistin levels and systemic inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes Discussion We have demonstrated that in human macrophages an inflammatory cascade with secretion of cytokines including TNF and IL 6 is sufficient and necessary for the induction of resistin Insulin sensitizers that have anti inflammatory properties including a synthetic PPAR agonist as well as aspirin suppress macrophage resistin expression as does direct inhibition of NF B Experimental endotoxemia in healthy volunteers based on the well established gram negative bacterial inflammatory response in humans 38 39 40 induces a dramatic elevation of circulating resistin levels Hence resistin gene and protein expression are increased by inflammatory stimuli both ex vivo and in vivo In rodents resistin is produced exclusively by adipocytes regulates normal glucose homeostasis and causes insulin resistance at high circulating levels 11 13 Translation of resistin s metabolic effects from rodents to humans has been problematic because peripheral blood mononuclear cells and macrophages appear to be a primary source of resistin in humans 15 16 This species difference in primary locus of expression is yet another example of the close and functionally overlapping relationship between adipocytes and macrophages 41 Numerous studies have reported that circulating resistin levels are increased in human obesity 20 25 26 41 and diabetes 19 20 23 42 43 Our data suggest that whereas hyperresistinemia in obese rodents derives directly from adipocytes human resistin is indirectly regulated by the inflammatory internal milieu of obesity Figure 6B Indeed obesity is associated with elevated levels of cytokines whose systemic administration leads to impaired glucose homeostasis 36 44 45 such as TNF and IL 6 which we show here to mediate the inflammatory induction of human resistin Thus in both species adipose tissue is an endocrine organ containing adipocytes as well as macrophages that regulates energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis through secretion of multiple factors including inflammatory cytokines 46 Clearly the relationship between obesity inflammation and resistin expression is complex and needs to be systematically studied in larger and varied patient populations Intriguingly we found a strong correlation between plasma levels of resistin and sTNFR2 the soluble cleavage product of the activated TNF receptor in diabetic patients A comparable correlation between resistin and sTNFR2 R 0 31 p 0 001 was found in a cohort of 879 non diabetic individuals in whom resistin levels independently correlated with coronary atherosclerotic disease M P Reilly M Lehrke M L Wolfe A Rohatgi M A Lazar and D J Rader unpublished data LPS binds to pathogen associated molecular pattern innate immune receptors such as CD14 and Toll like receptor 4 activating signal cascades involving NF B and MAPK 47 and thereby inducing the transcription and secretion of early cytokines including TNF and IL 1 48 We have shown here that these early cytokines are responsible for secondary induction or enhancement of resistin expression in macrophages Hyperresistinemia impairs glucose homeostasis in rodents 49 50 and inflammatory states are associated with insulin resistance 36 which may serve as a physiological attempt to increase the provision of glucose to the brain under stress conditions Indeed induction of acute inflammation by administration of LPS causes insulin resistance in humans 37 and here we have demonstrated the concomitant induction of resistin Interestingly the peak in TNF and IL 6 levels after LPS administration to humans precedes a phase of prolonged insulin resistance that begins approximately 6 h after LPS administration 37 closely approximating the time course of resistin induction Hence resistin is a potential mediator of insulin resistance in humans with acute inflammation Moreover obesity is associated with activation of innate immunity 6 including the inflammatory mediators that induce resistin In this context it is intriguing that resistin levels are increased in obesity 25 26 and that insulin sensitizing agents such as aspirin and rosiglitazone with disparate primary molecular targets antagonize resistin induction Indeed thiazolidinedione suppression of resistin levels has recently been correlated with hepatic insulin sensitization 43 Future work will be needed to better understand the relationship between circulating resistin levels and the insulin resistance characteristic of inflammatory states including obesity
