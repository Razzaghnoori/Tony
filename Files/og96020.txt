Senate The Honorable Bob Stump Chairman The Honorable G V Montgomery Ranking Minority Member Committee on Veterans Affairs House of Representatives Subject Compensation for Disability Resulting from Hospitalization Treatment Examination or Vocational Rehabilitation Pursuant to section 801 a 2 A of title 5 United States Code this is our report on a major rule promulgated by the Department of Veterans Affairs VA entitled Compensation for Disability Resulting from Hospitalization Treatment Examination or Vocational Rehabilitation RIN 2900 AH44 We received the rule on May 21 1996 It was published in the Federal Register as a final rule on May 23 1996 61 Fed Reg 25787 This rule adopts with minor nonsubstantive changes an interim rule amending VA adjudication regulations concerning compensation for disability or death resulting from VA hospitalization medical or surgical treatment or examination Before the interim rule establishing entitlement to compensation for adverse results of medical or surgical treatment required that VA be at fault or that an accident occur The interim rule to conform the regulations to a recent United States Supreme Court decision Brown v Gardner 115 S Ct 552 1994 deleted the fault or accident requirement and instead provided that compensation is payable for all but those injuries that are the certain or very nearly certain result of properly administered medical treatment to which a veteran consented For example if a veteran had 1024627 consented to the amputation of a gangrenous leg VA would not compensate him for the loss of a limb Enclosed is our assessment of the VA s compliance with the procedural steps required by section 801 a 1 B i through iv of title 5 with respect to the rule Our review indicates that VA complied with the applicable requirements If you have any questions about this report please contact Kathleen E Wannisky Associate General Counsel for Operations at 202 512 8326 The official responsible for GAO

its implementation of Executive Order 12866 the Department of Veterans Affairs VA prepared a cost and budgetary analysis The estimated cost to the government and benefit to veterans disabled as a result of VA hospitalization medical or surgical treatment is 166 5 million during fiscal year 1996 244 7 million during fiscal year 1997 327 million during fiscal year 1998 413 6 million during

rule was submitted on May 21 1996 ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 Pursuant to section 605 b of the Act VA certified in the preamble to the interim rule 60 Fed Reg 14222 14223 March 16 1995 that the rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act Therefore it was not required to prepare an initial or final regulatory flexibility analysis under sections 603 and 604 of the Act For the same reason sections 607 and 609 are inapplicable According to a VA official VA s section 605 b certification was not provided separately to the Small Business Administration SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy Rather in accordance with VA s practice publication of the certification in the Federal Register was treated as providing notice to SBA An SBA official has confirmed that some agencies follow this practice without objection from SBA iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C 1532 1535 According to VA this rulemaking action does not impose unfunded mandates under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 iv Other relevant information or requirements under Acts and Executive orders 1024627 Administrative Procedure Act 5 U S C 551 et seq Although the Act 5 U S C 553 b A does not require agencies to give general notice of a proposed rulemaking when issuing an interpretive rule1 such as this VA promulgated this rule through the general notice of proposed rulemaking procedures of the Act 5 U S C 553 VA afforded interested parties the opportunity to comment on the interim rule The preamble to the final rule evaluated and responded to the comments received Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U S C 3501 3520 This rule contains no information collection requirements subject to the Act Statutory authorization for the rule 38 U S C 1151 provides for the payment of disability or dependency and indemnity compensation for additional disability or death resulting from an injury or aggravation of an injury suffered as the result of VA hospitalization medical or surgical treatment examination or pursuit of a course of vocational rehabilitation under 38 U S C ch 31 Executive Order No 12866 Based on its economic impact the rule was determined by the Office of Management and Budget to be a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order No 12866 VA supplied to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs a planned regulatory action document that described the reason for the amendment to existing VA regulations and also assessed the costs and budgetary impact of the rule According to VA the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs reviewed the rule at the final stage and suggested no changes Executive Order No 12899 According to a VA official relevant portions of Executive Order No 12899 Civil Justice Reform were considered in issuing this final rule Our review of both the interim and final rules and accompanying documentation suggests that appropriate consideration was given to this Executive Order 1This rule amends VA s regulations regarding the award of compensation for disability resulting from hospitalization treatment examination or vocational rehabilitation to reflect the Supreme Court s interpretation of 38 U S C 1151 as stated in Brown v Gardner 115 S Ct 552 1994 Page 2 1024627 Section 3 b 2 B requires agencies to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation specifies in clear language the effect on existing Federal law or regulation VA clearly indicated in both the interim rule and the final rule the amendments to the previous adjudication regulations necessitated by the Supreme Court decision in Brown 115 S Ct 552 1994 Section 3 b 2 C requires agencies to provide a clear legal standard rather than a general standard VA adopted the standard for determining a veteran s right to compensation contained in Brown 115 S Ct at 555 and incorporated it into the final rule in what appears to be a clear and unambiguous manner Section 3 b 2 D requires agencies to specify in clear language the retroactive effect if any given to the regulation In the preamble to the interim rule VA clearly states that the effective date of the rule is November 25 1991 the date of the Court of Veterans Appeals decision that invalidated the former regulations In the preamble to the final rule VA responded to comments submitted on the interim rule including comments concerning the effective date After discussing the comments VA again stated that the effective date of the rule would be November 25 1991 Finally section 3 b 2 F requires agencies to define key terms in their regulations The regulation includes a definition of the term necessary consequences a key element to be considered in determining a veteran s eligibility for compensation under this rule VA did not identify any other statute or executive order imposing procedural requirements relevant to the rule Page 3 1024627
