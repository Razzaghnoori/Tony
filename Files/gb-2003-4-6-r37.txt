 Background Development of the male genitalia is largely controlled by cells in the urogenital mesenchyme that express androgen receptors AR 1 2 Germline mutations of the AR gene produce a spectrum of developmental abnormalities in 46 XY individuals ranging from infertility or mild hypospadias to complete feminization which are collectively referred to as the androgen insensitivity syndrome AIS In general the degree of genital ambiguity correlates with the level of compromise of AR function 46 XY individuals with AR inactivating mutations are completely feminized despite high levels of serum testosterone 3 4 5 The molecular events responsible for AR dependent male genital morphogenesis are poorly understood We hypothesized that the AR dependent mesenchymal programs underlying male external genitalia development might be illuminated by comparing the transcriptional profile of mesenchyme derived stromal cells from normal males to those from individuals affected with AIS As cultured genital fibroblasts originate from the urogenital mesenchyme and retain expression of the AR in vitro we compared gene expression patterns in cultured genital fibroblasts from normal 46 XY males and from 46 XY females with severe or complete AIS using DNA microarrays representing 32 968 distinct human genes We found striking differences in the gene expression profiles of genital fibroblasts cultured from normal and AIS patients but no transcriptional response to androgen was detectable in any of the cultured genital fibroblasts Results Baseline gene transcription in genital fibroblasts To gain insights into the role of androgen in genital morphogenesis we compared basal transcriptional patterns in genital fibroblasts from 46 XY individuals with either wild type AR or germline inactivation of the AR as a result of mutation We could not identify mutations in the AR gene in two phenotypically female individuals with complete AIS However genital skin fibroblasts of both subjects failed to express AR protein and did not show androgen binding Table 1 Initially we restricted our analysis to genital skin fibroblasts grown from the foreskin of nine normal males and from the labia majora of five AIS affected 46 XY individuals with female external genitalia The AR status of all genital fibroblasts was confirmed by AR gene sequencing and hormone binding assays Table 1 To determine basal gene expression patterns mRNA was isolated from growth arrested G 0 confluent cells and analyzed using DNA microarrays of approximately 43 000 cDNAs representing 32 968 genes Distinct differences in the basal expression profiles of normal and AIS derived fibroblasts allowed these two groups to be distinguished on the basis of their expression patterns by unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis Figure 1 We then identified 404 unique transcripts represented by 487 total cDNAs with significant differences in expression levels between normal and AIS genital fibroblasts using the significance analysis of microarrays SAM procedure 6 with a false discovery rate of less than 0 92 percent of genes identified by chance alone We used the list of the 487 cDNAs from the SAM analysis for hierarchical clustering analysis of 24 different primary fibroblast lines from normal and AIS affected individuals Figure 2 In addition to the 14 genital skin fibroblast lines used to generate the SAM list we included five gonadal fibroblast lines from 46 XY females with complete AIS a prostate fibroblast cell line from a normal male analyzed twice abdominal skin fibroblasts from a normal male forearm fibroblasts from a normal male and genital fibroblasts from two AIS 46 XY females who had documented AR mosaicism ARD364 ARD 465 Table 1 The ARD364 and ARD465 lines express wild type AR and were derived from individuals who were mosaics for wild type AR and AR with a premature stop codon 7 Hierarchical cluster analysis based on the expression of 472 of the 487 previously identified transcripts with measurable expression across at least 80 of 24 experiments separated the fibroblasts into those with gene expression patterns resembling normal male foreskin fibroblasts and a second group with an expression pattern more similar to labial skin fibroblasts from AIS affected individuals Figure 2 The latter group contained all five gonadal fibroblast lines from complete AIS females as well as the fibroblast lines from abdominal and forearm skin The prostate fibroblasts on the other hand displayed expression patterns largely similar to the normal male foreskin cells Notably the two mosaic AIS cell lines ARD364 and ARD465 showed gene expression patterns that most resembled normal male foreskin Figure 2 Comparison of expression patterns in genital fibroblasts from normal and AIS affected individuals and fibroblasts from extragenital sites offers possible insights into the programs that underlie genital development For instance transcripts encoding homeobox A13 protein HOXA13 and T box proteins TBX showed striking differences in their expression levels between the male genital and AIS extragenital fibroblasts HOXA13 was expressed at high levels in normal male foreskin fibroblasts and at low levels in all AIS and extragenital fibroblasts Figure 2 T box gene 3 TBX3 was expressed at higher levels in the fibroblasts from genital skin extragenital skin or prostate from males than in genital skin fibroblasts from AIS 46 XY females Figure 2 TBX2 showed an almost identical expression profile to TBX3 whereas high TBX5 expression appeared to be restricted to foreskin fibroblasts from normal males including those from the phenotypically female mosaic patient ARD364 BMP4 bone morphogenetic protein 4 was predominantly expressed in foreskin fibroblasts from normal males and in prostate fibroblasts Figure 2 WNT2 wingless type MMTV integration site family member 2 was part of a small gene cluster with high expression in normal male foreskin fibroblasts that distinguished these samples from all other fibroblasts Figure 2 Compared to genital and gonadal fibroblasts from 46 XY females fibroblasts from normal male genital tissues showed pronounced differences in expression of cell adhesion and extracellular matrix genes For example cadherin 13 CDH13 versican CSPG2 collagen 8A1 COL8A1 collagen 12A1 COL12A1 P4HA2 encoding a procollagen modifying enzyme all showed relatively low expression in the genital skin fibroblasts of normal males whereas tenascin XB TNXB nidogen 2 NID2 laminins LAMA3 LAMA4 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 TIMP1 all showed relatively high expression levels compared to AIS derived fibroblasts Figure 2 Several of the differentially expressed genes including aldo keto reductase 1C1 AKR1C1 aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 ALDH1A1 and alcohol dehydrogenase 1B ADH1B function in sex steroid and retinoic acid metabolism Figure 2 Other differentially expressed genes such as mitogen activated protein kinase 14 MAP3K14 and STAT induced STAT inhibitors 2 and 3 STATI2 SSI 3 encode proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction Transcriptional response of cultured genital fibroblasts to androgen treatment We tested the responses of normal and AIS genital fibroblasts to dihydrotestosterone DHT under culture conditions similar to those that were reported to produce aromatase induction in these cells 8 Cells were treated with DHT 100 1 000 nM both at confluency G 0 and during exponential growth and transcript levels were assessed using DNA microarrays Unsupervised hierarchical clustering did not disclose any obvious differences in gene expression patterns between DHT treated and ethanol treated fibroblasts either in normal controls or in AIS derived cell lines We treated LNCaP prostate cancer cells with androgen under similar conditions and readily identified nearly 500 transcripts modulated by androgen with unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis and with supervised methods 9 and data not shown A supervised analysis comparing gene expression patterns of DHT treated fibroblasts to ethanol treated controls was carried out using the SAM procedure Again no genes could be identified that were significantly induced or repressed by DHT treatment Additional experiments using physiological concentrations of androgen for example 0 01 1 nM methyltrienolone also failed to disclose any androgen responsive genes data not shown In contrast SAM analysis identified 1 664 transcripts that differed significantly between proliferating and confluent cells and 1 232 transcripts that differed between fibroblasts derived from AIS affected individuals and normal male foreskin Hierarchical cluster analysis of these experiments clearly showed the distinct differences in transcriptional profiles between AIS derived and normal male fibroblasts and between proliferating and normal fibroblasts Figure 3 Cells derived from the same individual and cultured under the same conditions always showed highly similar gene expression patterns suggesting that the differences in expression between individuals are stable and reproducible despite passage in vitro Figure 3 Discussion We found consistent characteristic differences in baseline gene expression patterns between genital skin fibroblasts from normal males and 46 XY female patients with AIS Many of these differences between normal and AIS derived fibroblasts were also observed in gonadal fibroblasts suggesting that these differences are not purely due to differences in the anatomical site of origin of the fibroblasts Interestingly fibroblasts derived from abdominal and forearm skin regions with relatively little sexual dimorphism showed gene expression patterns similar to the labial skin fibroblasts of AIS patients Together these data suggest that the AR is involved in determining a stable and stereotypical program of gene expression in genital fibroblasts that does not require the continuing presence of androgen for its maintenance A critical question raised by these results is whether the observed differences between genital fibroblasts from males and AIS females reflect cell autonomous effects of androgen exposure during development or indirect effects of the AR dependent genital morphogenetic program One possible interpretation of these data is that the distinct patterns of expression could have been due to differences in the origin or the developmental milieu of foreskin fibroblasts derived from the genital tubercle as opposed to the labial fibroblasts derived from the genital swellings 10 The differences in gene expression we observed in AIS fibroblasts of gonadal origin compared to those of labial origin support this view Figure 3 We have observed consistent and characteristic differences in the gene expression patterns of skin fibroblasts derived from different locations on the body 11 However the current set of experiments suggests that the androgen receptor has a cell autonomous role which contributes to a stable androgen independent gene expression pattern in genital fibroblasts Expression patterns in cultured labial skin fibroblasts derived from two different individuals with AR mosaicism suggested that the cell autonomous AR status was a relevant determinant of baseline gene expression in genital skin fibroblasts Both these fibroblast lines although derived from morphologically female genitalia in phenotypically female 46 XY individuals mosaic for AR inactivating mutations expressed wild type AR in the cultured cells These female AIS affected individuals are thought to have acquired their AR gene mutations post zygotically 12 ARD364 which showed AR protein expression and binding in the range of normal male foreskin fibroblasts 7 and see Table 1 despite its origin from anatomically female genitalia had a gene expression pattern indistinguishable from foreskin fibroblasts of normal males Figure 2 The second fibroblast line from an AR mosaic patient ARD465 Table 1 had very low wild type AR expression and showed baseline gene expression patterns that were nevertheless more similar to normal male foreskin and prostate fibroblasts than to any of the AIS derived cell lines Figure 2 The discrepancy between the female phenotype of these mosaic individuals despite expression of the wild type AR in cultured genital skin fibroblasts is not resolved to date 7 It may be explained by a time dependent rise of an originally small fraction of cells containing the wild type AR allele in the mosaic genital mesenchyme during prenatal and postnatal development or by differences between in vivo and in vitro conditions Yet the documented expression of the wild type AR in cultures of these labial cells supports the idea that the AR status of the fibroblast was an important intrinsic determinant of the basal transcription patterns we identified Therefore the AR appears to be involved in setting long lasting gene expression patterns in genital skin fibroblasts Comparison of gene expression patterns in genital fibroblasts from normal and AIS affected individuals and in fibroblasts from extragenital sites may offer clues to the programs that underlie external genital development Both cell adhesion and connective tissue remodeling are indispensable for normal development and maintenance of tissue integrity 13 14 15 The differential expression of proteoglycans collagens and cell adhesion molecules for example cadherin 13 might be involved in genital morphogenesis and later stability of sexually dimorphic traits of the external genitalia Some genes expressed in wild type AR cells could influence androgen signaling For instance aldo keto reductase 1C1 is specifically involved in cellular androgen metabolism 16 and thus may modulate the spectrum of cellular androgenic steroids available for activation of the AR Structurally different androgens elicit different patterns of response from several androgen responsive promoters suggesting that the type of ligand present could affect cellular response 17 Mitogen activated protein kinase 14 and STAT induced STAT inhibitors 2 and 3 were expressed at significantly higher levels in cells with wild type AR Both MAP kinase and STAT pathways are involved in AR dependent regulation and in ligand independent activation of the AR 18 Differential expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 and alcohol dehydrogenase 1B enzymes that affect retinoic acid biosynthesis suggest that other signaling pathways may participate in the AR initiated programs of external genital differentiation 19 20 Several genes expressed specifically in the normal male foreskin fibroblasts have been previously implicated in male genital development including HOXA13 the T box genes BMP4 and DWnt2 Mutations in HOXA13 can cause distal limb and urogenital tract malformations such as male hypospadias in hand foot genital syndrome 21 T box genes TBX are essential early regulators of limb development and also appear to be involved in male genital development 22 23 Mutations in TBX3 cause the ulnar mammary syndrome characterized by limb apocrine and genital developmental abnormalities 23 Expression of T box genes 2 3 and 5 was significantly higher in normal male foreskin fibroblasts than in AIS genital fibroblasts BMP4 has been implicated in ductal budding and branching during prostate development 24 and a potential role of BMP4 in external genital development has also been postulated 25 DWnt2 has been found to have roles in sex specific cell determination in the gonads and genital disc of Drosophila 26 Thus mutations in genes characteristically expressed in normal male foreskin fibroblasts can in some cases lead to defective genital development The data from these experiments therefore provide candidate genes for further investigation in patients with genital malformations As normal genital skin fibroblasts of 46 XY male individuals express the AR in vitro see Table 1and 4 7 we had anticipated that androgen treatment would elicit a transcriptional response program that could provide additional insights into the role of androgen in genital development We have previously used a similar approach to delineate the transcriptional programs activated in prostate cancer cells in response to androgen 9 We had hoped that comparison of transcriptional responses of normal fibroblasts to those from AIS affected individuals with varying degrees of genital ambiguity would provide still further insights into androgen s role in genital morphogenesis However we were unable to detect any significant changes in gene expression patterns in cultured AR expressing genital fibroblasts or in AIS derived fibroblasts in response to androgens Although two previous reports have shown increases in aromatase enzymatic activity in genital skin fibroblasts treated with dihydrotestosterone DHT 8 27 others have failed to observe changes in aromatase activity in response to androgen 28 In agreement with our findings Elmlinger et al found significantly different baseline expression levels of insulin like growth factor IGF and insulin like growth factor binding protein IGFBP between normal and AIS derived genital skin fibroblasts and could not detect changes in transcript levels in response to androgen treatment 29 In normal genital fibroblasts androgen responsive reporter genes can only be activated by expression of co transfected AR in the presence of ligand 30 Therefore endogenous AR expression itself may be insufficient in genital skin fibroblasts to elicit a transcriptional response Moreover the lack of detectable changes in transcript levels for any of the 30 000 genes in the AIS fibroblasts virtually excludes the possibility that DHT or R1881 could be acting through other steroid receptors or other signaling pathways The differences in androgen responsiveness we have observed between normal genital fibroblasts and prostate cancer epithelial cells in vitro might reflect the responses seen in vivo Prostate epithelial cells retain exquisite sensitivity to androgen throughout life Androgen deprivation produces profound involution of the prostate particularly of the epithelial component but little or no change in the external genitalia It is possible that genital mesenchymal cells are only capable of responding to androgen at discrete stages in development in their specific in vivo environment In mice stromal androgen responsiveness is restricted to the earliest stages in prostate development and later the epithelial compartment becomes responsive and remains so 1 This responsiveness may be mediated through the expression of specific AR co regulators Compared to LNCaP cells normal male genital fibroblasts show distinctly lower baseline expression of several AR co regulators such as NCOA2 GRIP 1 NCOA3 TRAM 1 ARA54 RNF14 data not shown Thus genital fibroblasts may express critical AR co regulators at discrete times during development that allow them to respond by setting up long lasting transcriptional programs that underlie the genesis and maintenance of genital morphology Conclusions Our data suggest that in addition to androgen independent positional influences on fibroblast phenotypes the AR is originally involved in establishing stable and reproducible patterns of gene expression in stromal cells during genital differentiation which are reflected in the differences in global gene expression patterns between fibroblasts cultured from the genital skin of normal individuals and females affected by AIS Comparison of the expression patterns of genital fibroblasts from 46 XY normal males and 46 XY females with inactivated AR provides a window on the AR dependent gene expression programs within the urogenital mesenchyme which contribute to the development and structural integrity of male and female genitalia For further discrimination of androgen independent positional effects from prenatal androgen actions on expression phenotypes of genital fibroblast strains comparative expression profiling of homologous genital tissues is needed The apparent lack of response of genital fibroblasts to androgen in vitro despite expression of a normal AR has important implications for future research in defining the role of androgen in genital development and the pathogenesis of ambiguous genitalia Transcriptional profiling of the early stages of genital development in vivo in the presence and absence of androgen may provide further insights into the role of androgen in genital development Materials and methods Cell strains Primary cultures of genital fibroblasts were established from genital skin biopsies labia majora or gonadal biopsies in female AIS patients and from the foreskin of normal males undergoing circumcision Abdominal skin fibroblasts were derived from the midline above the mons pubis of a fertile male during abdominal surgery Forearm skin fibroblasts from a normal male were a gift from H Chang Department of Biochemistry Stanford University Peripheral zone prostate fibroblasts were a gift from D Peehl Department of Urology Stanford University and were established from a histologically normal region of a patient undergoing prostatectomy for prostate cancer who had not been previously treated with hormonal therapy Hormone binding assays using methyltrienolone R1881 17 hydroxy 17 methyl 4 9 11 estrotrien 3 one and androgen receptor sequencing have been described previously 7 Cell culture and hormone treatment For determination of basal gene expression profiles without androgen stimulation fibroblasts were cultured on 150 mm plastic dishes at 37 C with 5 CO 2 To eliminate possible artifacts due to differing states of proliferation cells were grown to confluence at which point they enter G 0 arrest 31 They were maintained in phenol red free DMEM F12 Dulbecco s modified Eagle Medium with the nutrient mix F12 Gibco containing L glutamine 15 mM Hepes buffer penicillin streptomycin Gibco and 12 9 of a constant lot of certified fetal calf serum FCS Gibco The pH was adjusted to 7 4 with 1 N NaOH and the medium was exchanged every 48 h At day 13 the last media exchange was carried out and 96 h later cells were scraped and mRNA harvested directly Androgen stimulation of genital fibroblasts was carried out under two different culture conditions similar to those previously reported to produce induction of aromatase enzymatic activity in these cell lines 8 27 In the first cells were grown to confluence as described above using phenol red free DMEM F12 containing L glutamine 15 mM Hepes buffer penicillin streptomycin Gibco with 12 9 charcoal stripped steroid free FCS D S FCS Hyclone to ensure androgen depleted conditions in control cells With every media exchange every 48 h cells received either ethanol in a final dilution of 1 100 000 or 100 nM dihydrotestosterone DHT dissolved in ethanol The last DHT treatment was administered with the last media exchange 96 h before lysate preparation In total six doses of either ethanol or 100 nM DHT were given In the second set of experiments cells were cultured to confluence for 14 days as described above They were then trypsinized and seeded at a density of 3 000 cells per cm 2in 150 mm plates Twenty four hours later medium was removed and cells were washed three times with new media containing 12 9 D S FCS then cultured for another 24 h interval in the absence of androgens Cells were then treated with either 1 100 000 ethanol 100 nM or 1 000 nM DHT dissolved in ethanol After 24 h incubation exponentially growing cells were harvested LNCaP cells passaged and treated under similar conditions were used as a positive control for androgen reponsiveness RNA isolation and cDNA labeling Protocols for mRNA preparation and cDNA labeling are available online 32 mRNA 2 g from single experiments was reverse transcribed and labeled with Cy5 pseudo coloured red and pooled reference mRNA was labeled with Cy3 pseudo coloured green Reference mRNA contained equal mixtures of fibroblast mRNA pooled from confluent and proliferating cultures of normal and AIS genital skin fibroblasts and a common reference of mRNAs isolated from 11 different proliferating cultured tumor cell lines that we have described previously 33 Microarrays and hybridizations Microarrays with approximately 43 000 sequence validated PCR amplified human cDNAs representing 32 968 UniGene clusters were manufactured as described 32 Hybridizations were performed using equal amounts of Cy3 and Cy5 labeled cDNAs according to previously published protocols 32 Hybridized microarrays were scanned using a GenePix4000 array scanner and analyzed with GenePix Pro 3 0 software Axon Instruments Union City CA Microarray data analysis Only spots with fluorescence signals 1 5 fold greater than background in either the experimental or reference samples were included in the analysis To correct for variations in cDNA labeling efficiency we normalized the Cy5 Cy3 fluorescence ratios for all genes in each array hybridization to obtain an average log 2 ratio of 0 We restricted our analysis to genes with measurable expression in 80 of the samples we analyzed We used the SAM procedure 6 to identify genes with statistically significant differences in baseline expression levels between normal and AIS genital fibroblasts The SAM procedure computes a two sample T statistic for example for normal vs AIS cell lines for the normalized log ratios of gene expression levels for each gene It thresholds the T statistics to provide a significant gene list and provides an estimate of the false discovery rate the percent of genes identified by chance alone from randomly permuted data Gene expression data were clustered 34 35 and results were visualized using TreeView software 35 To identify the effects of androgen treatment on gene expression in genital fibroblasts we carried out a set of 21 DNA microarray analyses of mRNA from normal and AIS genital fibroblasts This dataset included cells treated at confluence G 0 or during exponential proliferation as described above Raw data were filtered normalized and centered as described above We used the SAM procedure to identify transcripts with significant differences in expression with reference to the origin of the fibroblast lines whether the cells were confluent or proliferating and
