 well i i don t think that it s it s wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions for instance jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there s where there s uh endangerment to their own life and other people s lives all right i agree with that people that are uh driving um hum like uh truck drivers and things like that i definitely think they should be tested and and i m not i m not opposed to any testing i mean um hum because i know i certainly wouldn t want to uh you know be endangered by somebody in a company that accidentally dropped something on me or you know because he was on drugs while he was there yeah uh well how do you feel how do you feel about uh companies drug testing prior to hiring oh um i was tested uh within my company i think it s it s it s kind of a push to uh weed out drugs in states and because i don t know of any other countries that are doing this um hum and i feel i feel like it s really just within the United States it s um it s okay i think your record should stand for itself that you know if you ve been tested at other companies and you ve always come up negative or whatever then i don t see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over and once you ve established the fact that you re not a drug user and um hum especially if your personality proves that you re not um hum i think they could uh save money by not doing that you know every time say if you change jobs that you you wouldn t have to do it if you d just been tested at your other work place well what about random testing though oh right do do you feel like that s an invasion invasion of certain people s rights if not everyone is tested uh not if it s done fairly and that s probably my question is how how do you know it s done fairly i don t know that you do if it s random then it s random and that s not necessarily fair yeah well they might tell you it s random um hum but then you know it s kind of like a a lottery somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person doesn t win anything and tries and tries and tries yeah you know well i happen i know that for instance in the NC double A they drug test and it s not random oh i see how d how did they how do they pick their people um well i think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season and from that point on uh uh huh at the NC double A does have something to do with it but it s almost discretionary on the coach s part of each individual individually individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem oh i see so do you and and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time right well do you think that should be implemented in the work place you know as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs do you think they should have the right to send them well not being a drug user i don t have a problem with that personally but i think that might be a violation of someone s rights if someone s to be tested right having personal problems for some reason that s causing them to have behave differently and their manager assumes they have a drug problem i mean if someone assumed that of me i would be upset right right right yeah it it would almost be like a a uh it s an accusation and and it s and it s based based on on uh perception that someone has of how a drug user would behave when some drugs users behave uh huh uh normal uh you know right and then how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative and you know your supervisor has accused you of using drugs right exactly it it i don t the i think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it s across the board from from the janitors to the executive management right i agree with that because i know personally myself i ve been in the same job for three years it ll be three years in August and i ve already been drug tested three times um hum what type of job do you have well i m an environmental engineer uh huh and i ve been drug tested three times and i know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime and the company i work for is sixty thousand people plus so see i i for some reason i ve come up three times that s pretty high statistics well does your job require does your job require you to drive company equipment or to operate any type of machinery that might endanger endanger someone no no not at all it well it that doesn t i i mean i i it s a legal job you know uh huh so see it s really strange hum that is odd i was drug tested uh not for the job i have now but for the prior job uh but i know that they sent that the job i had before that well the job i have have now requested my uh uh my uh medical record from my old company oh uh huh so i don t know if i wasn t drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me didn t request the drug test because i know that my company does drug testing on occasion right well does your the company say for instance does the company you worked for before before have the right or do they have the ability to say hey we ve already drug tested her and and she came up negative well no i don t think they can they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that i i didn t i mean they they don t know that i don t use drugs they just tested me once yeah right right yeah but i used to work for a power company so it was very important that they make sure their employees especially linemen uh huh uh were clean uh huh and since i was just you know one of the office folk i guess it wasn t as important to them that they test me regularly but i know they test most of the service people fairly regularly regularly uh just across the board uh huh yeah and are they tested random no they re all of them are tested once every three months it s a rotation they re oh okay i see but it but again it depends on what job you re in the men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot yeah and the men that drive the trucks with with the guys that fix the power lines aren t tested as much uh huh uh huh but but see they make that clear to them as they hire those guys what the what the drug testing schedule is they say we we re testing you tomorrow and we ll test you every three months thereafter while you work here oh i see uh huh okay so they know that and they yeah it s it s made very c lear upon hiring uh huh okay well well have we spent our at least five minutes okay yeah i think so yeah seven twenty five okay okay nice speaking to you nice to talk to you too bye bye okay bye
