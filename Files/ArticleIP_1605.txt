 Just Say Yes Hair Dryer Never Easy produced by Merkley Newman Harty for ABC TV s public service announcements ABC Television s anti drug crusade March Against Drugs has already been attacked in Slate as bogus propagandizing Whatever the merits of the campaign which includes public service announcements and drug education plugs in the network s dramas and sitcoms this piece of advertising works Hair Dryer the first part of this spot uses a combination of laconism and high production values to appeal to both parents and children Never Easy the second reverses field and feel with a talking head who while almost didactic in her delivery of a simple message and a not so subtle push for ABC itself is young enough earnest enough to strike a chord across her audience Cobbling multiple cuts of film into a snappy collage the first 13 seconds seem to prepare you for a hair care pitch not a drug advisory But pace and contrast set up a complex visual message before the first words are ever spoken First the hair dryer then the clutter of a young girl s bathroom The dryer blasting at a flipped head of hair then a mirrored glimpse of a soulful pout A full length view of the girl shot from behind in sharply faded color then a less clearly articulated close up of her face And then the eyes lidded strangely knowing lingering in the mirror There is a disquieting dialogue at work here the play of color capturing the tensions of the chrysalis Vibrant hues for prelapsarian innocence bleached tones for the budding adult A switch to full color accompanies the first words spoken in a childlike voice over It might not be easy to talk to kids today especially about marijuana As the words begin the colors fade drawing you toward the obvious it s hard to talk to kids today because kids are no longer just kids theme But a fillip of clich s the braces under the smile the self conscious glance downward brings the kid back for the moment The spot quickens she s almost done with the dryer she s almost outta here The spot briefly reprises the faded hues the blond hair flashing gray the lighting evoking a street corner for a moment before focusing on ringed fingers and thumb turning the dryer off The thumb ring even more than the earrings that have been there all along taps fertile ground its associations with rebellion and the unwillingness to conform inevitable From thumb rings to smoke rings wouldn t be a long step some would say and the statistics show that for an increasing number of teens the smoke is coming from marijuana But this one hasn t taken that step yet She s standing stock still for now the voice that acknowledged how difficult it was for parents to talk marijuana with kids now asking Camus like But if you don t do it who will This is the best witness and the most persuasive advocate a kid telling parents that their kids want and need to hear from them As the first half of the spot ends we notice the disclaimer crediting it to the Partnership for a Drug Free America The second half actually the last seven seconds takes a radically different entirely linear approach using a talking head General Hospital s Amber Tamblyn who plays the almost but not quite redoubtable Emily Bowen whose drug abuse yes indeed sparked shocking and tragic consequences on GH this week Tamblyn reiterates that marijuana is a sticky wicket then suggests a way out almost as a matter of course Tune into ABC March 30 and we ll help Research shows that parents today want that help that they lack the language to bridge the generation gap and persuade their teens not to do as they did in the 60s and 70s That s why this spot will probably succeed in its effort to make parents tune in March 30 The other message of course is that ABC is au courant with the role of family values in politics today and that it cares enough to turn over prime time to the anti drug campaign It has been estimated that ABC could lose as much as 1 7 million in March revenue just by running one 30 second public service spot in lieu of its paid commercial equivalent during the network s highest priced hour of time Tuesdays from 9 to 10 p m The ratings pandering and suspension of skepticism charges notwithstanding the public is likely to give ABC some credit The contrast between the two parts of the ad shows why agencies are paid so much to be creative the talking head wouldn t have done quite as well opening the act The spot closes with a chyron urging parental action Silence is acceptance Ennui is exactly what activists complain about They say the 90s have seen a steep drop in the time and space donated to anti drug messages from 365 million to 260 million annually Nancy Reagan s much derided Just Say No seems to have had an effect on the kids it targeted drug use actually went down This time it s the parents who are being told they can make a difference The gauntlet s down says ABC Just Say Yes Robert Shrum
