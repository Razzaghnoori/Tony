 Take the Money and Run The top issues are Bill Clinton s grant of clemency for imprisoned Puerto Rican nationalists and Bill Bradley s official announcement of his presidential candidacy The death of the GOP s tax cut and Pat Buchanan s likely defection to the Reform Party also get discussed The commentariat is nearly unanimous in its condemnation of Clinton s clemency for Puerto Ricans associated with a terrorist group One of the released prisoners Ricardo Jimenez appears on NBC s Meet the Press He does not make a good impression He rocks back and forth swivels in his chair stutters and shows little if any remorse for FALN bombings though he does renounce violence See quotations from the interview below Later in the program James Carville spars with wife Mary Matalin over the clemency issue Carville who as usual looks like a lizard on amphetamines notes that Jimmy Carter and many religious leaders including Bishop Desmond Tutu support the clemency But on PBS s NewsHour With Jim Lehrer Mark Shields scoffs at this defense For a while he says the president wouldn t even take Carter s phone calls so it s absurd to think Clinton now takes his advice on domestic policy And on CNN s Capital Gang Robert Novak speaks for many when he asks Can you explain to me how a president who wants you to go to jail if you don t have a trigger lock is going to say that these prisoners should be released even though they were collecting arms As for Hillary s belated disagreement with her husband over the clemency even her defenders such as Capital Gang s Al Hunt note that the move has only confirmed the stereotype of Hillary as tin eared and imperious Most pundits are impressed with Bill Bradley s speech announcing his candidacy as well as his rising polls NewsHour s Mark Shields says that Bradley aides are actually worried about peaking too soon Many opinion makers think Al Gore s campaign is getting into desperate trouble Robert Novak Capital Gang and George Stephanopoulos ABC s This Week thinks Gore might lose the AFL CIO s endorsement if Clinton brings China into the World Trade Organization But despite all this several pundits note that Gore is still the candidate to beat Al Hunt Capital Gang predicts that Bradley will have to win both Iowa and New Hampshire to have a chance at the nomination and Steve Roberts CNN s Late Edition warns that Bradley could veer too far left to remain electable The pundits like the GOP concede that tax cuts is a no win issue this year Several panelists including George F Will This Week and Michael Barone Late Edition think the GOP will make taxes a campaign issue in 2000 Karen Tumulty Late Edition and Sam Donaldson This Week note the oddity of Republicans wanting to spend the surplus and Democrats wanting to pay down the debt On Meet the Press Pat Buchanan all but announces his defection to the Reform Party I m leaning in that direction now strongly he says I genuinely believe I could win the presidency of the United States I think the road through the GOP primaries it s almost closed and rigged But the door is really wide open with the Reform Party Buchanan promises not to renounce his pro life views but stresses that abortion is the only issue on which he and the Reform Party disagree On This Week George Stephanopoulos notes that America s apparent involvement in East Timor will only serve to further alienate the isolationist Buchanan from the Republican mainstream Tim Russert Meet the Press flashes a poll indicating that Buchanan would consume nearly all of George W Bush s lead over Gore in a three way race Broder s Buchanan Bludgeoning Grilling Pat Buchanan on Meet the Press David Broder spends most of the interview imputing that Buchanan s views on foreign policy are anti Semitic As evidence he trots out a quote from Buchanan s new book buy it here arguing that American foreign policy is hostage to ethnic lobby groups and that the Israeli lobby is the most powerful Now Buchanan may in fact be anti Semitic many liberals and Jewish neo cons think so but a pundit as grizzled as Broder should know better than to make such a serious accusation without serious evidence Repent No Renounce Yes On Meet the Press Tim Russert asks released Puerto Rican prisoner Ricardo Jimenez If you in fact are part of an organ in support of an organ that sets off 130 bombs isn t there a pretty strong possibility that innocent people are going to be hurt and killed No no One hundred thirty bombs taverns restaurants places where civilians frequent No no If if if precautions I think all precautions were taken you know to make sure all human life was preserved Later Jimenez says I definitely will not be using any violence whatsoever or acts of violence to further any goals of the independence movement of Puerto Rico
