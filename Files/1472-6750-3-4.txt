 Background Recombinant viral vectors have become the primary agents for both in vitro and in vivo gene transfer applications 1 2 3 4 Viruses are powerful gene transfer agents since they have evolved specific efficient machinery to deliver nucleic acids into cells To our knowledge viral vectors have almost always been used free in solution For in vitro systems a solution containing free viral vectors is applied to target cells Similarly free viral vectors in solution are administered locally or systemically for in vivo gene transfer applications Some site specificity of the delivery of viral vectors can be achieved by applying a solution containing viral particles specifically to the site of interest for both in vitro and in vivo settings However such site specificity is seriously limited since viral vectors can diffuse freely in solution after application In this work we have developed a novel strategy for virus mediated in situ transduction of target cells on solid surfaces using adenoviral vectors as gene transfer agents In this strategy adenoviral particles are immobilized tightly and stably on solid surfaces while maintaining the natural properties of the viral vectors We reasoned that such immobilized viral vectors could infect cells only at the contact site between the solid surface and cells Thus the ultimate spatial arrangements of transduction sites on the solid surface could be controlled and determined at will by the strategic placement of viral vectors on the solid surface Results Virus mediated in situtransduction of cells on solid surfaces We have developed a novel strategy for virus mediated in situ transduction of target cells on solid surfaces using adenoviral vectors as gene transfer agents In this strategy adenoviral particles are immobilized tightly and stably on solid surfaces virus coated solid surfaces while maintaining their natural properties including infectivity We hypothesized that such viral vectors immobilized on a solid surface could infect cells only at the contact site between the solid surface and cells This could allow the spatial control and arrangements of transduction sites on a solid surface which can be determined by the strategic placement of viral particles on the solid surface Infectivity of biotinylated adenoviral vectors immobilized on solid surfaces The feasibility of this strategy was tested by using recombinant adenoviral vectors carrying a transducable lac Z galactosidase gene Ad5 CMV LacZ Qbiogene Montreal Canada The extremely tight interaction between the protein strept avidin and its ligand biotin K d 10 14M 5 6 7 8 9 was chosen as a means of tethering viral particles to the solid surface We previously showed that biotin moieties can be attached covalently to the outer surface of adenoviral vectors without appreciable effect on their infectivity under carefully controlled biotinylation conditions 10 11 Such biotinylated viral particles could be attached specifically and stably to a solid surface on which strept avidin is covalently immobilized avidin or streptavidin coated solid surface Biotinylation of Ad5 CMV LacZ was performed by using sulfo NHS LC biotin Pierce Chemical Rockford IL a biotin derivative containing an N hydroxysuccinimidyl ester NHS that reacts with primary amino groups Ad5 CMV LacZ was treated at varying concentrations 0 100 g ml of sulfo NHS LC biotin on ice for 2 h in PBS pH 7 4 followed by the removal of non virion associated biotinylation reagent by ultrafiltration The infectivities of the resulting adenoviral vectors were analyzed by using D 17 cells canine osteosarcoma cell line American Type Culture Collection ATCC Manassas VA highly permissive to adenoviral infection 10 as targets Little effect on viral infectivity was seen when the adenoviral vectors were treated with sulfo NHS LC biotin at concentrations up to approximately 40 g ml data not shown This is in agreement with our earlier study 10 These biotinylated adenoviral vectors were analyzed for their ability to infect cells when immobilized on streptavidin coated solid surfaces Ad5 CMV LacZ was treated with varying concentrations 0 30 g ml of sulfo NHS LC biotin and non virion associated biotinylation reagent was removed by repeated ultrafiltration The resulting biotinylated adenoviral vectors were incubated at 25 C for 2 h with gentle shaking in polystyrene wells on which streptavidin is covalently immobilized well diameter 0 64 cm Reacti Bind Streptavidin Coated Polystyrene Strip Plates Pierce Chemical 5 10 6viral particles per well The wells were washed to remove unbound viral particles and D 17 cells were placed directly in the wells 8 10 3cells per well and cultured at 37 C for 48 h followed by the analysis of the expression of the lac Z gene Fig 1 When Ad5 CMV LacZ was treated with sulfo NHS LC biotin at a concentration of 0 6 g ml or lower almost no infection of D 17 cells was seen In contrast substantial numbers of D 17 cells were transduced when Ad5 CMV LacZ was treated with 3 30 g ml sulfo NHS LC biotin The maximum infectivity was seen with Ad5 CMV LacZ that had been treated with 15 g ml sulfo NHS LC biotin where the infectivity was approximately 75 of that of unmodified Ad5 CMV LacZ used free in solution These results suggest that upon biotinylation of the viral surface under controlled conditions adenoviral vectors can be immobilized on a solid surface by using the strept avidin biotin interaction and that such immobilized adenoviral vectors are capable of infecting cells in situ on the solid surface Efficiency of immobilization of biotinylated adenoviral vectors Biotinylated Ad5 CMV LacZ which had been treated with 15 g ml sulfo NHS LC biotin followed by the removal of unreacted biotinylated reagent was used to determine the immobilization efficiency of biotinylated adenoviral vectors in streptavidin coated wells Known numbers of biotinylated Ad5 CMV LacZ particles were incubated in streptavidin coated wells for immobilization and the number of viral particles remaining unbound in the solution was estimated from their infectivity on D 17 cells Fig 2A Despite the extremely tight streptavidin biotin interaction only about 15 40 of viral particles were bound to the surface of streptavidin coated wells under the conditions used where the number of viral particles applied was considerably below saturation of the well surface estimated by both dimensional and biotin binding capacities of each well This result is in contrast with our previous study which showed that greater than 95 of biotinylated Ad5 CMV LacZ prepared under the same conditions can be readily captured on streptavidin coated microbeads 10 Thus the relatively low immobilization efficiency of biotinylated Ad5 CMV LacZ on the surface of streptavidin coated wells is not attributable to the absence of accessible biotin moieties on the surfaces of a fraction of viral particles or the presence of unreacted biotinylation reagent in the biotinylated Ad5 CMV LacZ preparations We hypothesized that the reduction of the immobilization efficiency is caused by physical or fluidic properties of viral vectors in wells in which viral particles may have a limited ability to migrate To test this a constant number of fresh biotinylated Ad5 CMV LacZ was applied to the same streptavidin coated well repeatedly 2 5 10 6viral particles per well per addition with the removal of unbound viral particles between the additions The efficiency of immobilization at each addition cycle was determined from the number of viral particles remaining unbound in the solution Fig 2B A relatively constant number of viral particles was bound to the well surface at each addition cycle of biotinylated Ad5 CMV LacZ This means that the total number of viral particles that were immobilized on the well surface increased roughly proportionally to the number of the addition cycle of biotinylated adenoviral particles This result suggests that the relatively low efficiency of immobilization of biotinylated adenoviral vectors is caused by their fluidic properties in wells which allow only a fraction of viral particles to reach the well surface and be captured by streptavidin molecules on the well surface Infectivity of immobilized adenoviral vectors The efficiency of in situ transduction by adenoviral vectors immobilized on streptavidin coated wells was investigated Varying numbers of biotinylated Ad5 CMV LacZ 2 5 10 5 2 5 10 8viral particles per well were added to streptavidin coated wells well diameter 0 64 cm for immobilization followed by the removal of unbound viral particles D 17 cells were placed in these virus coated wells 8 10 2cells per well and cultured at 37 C for 48 h Then the infection of the cells was analyzed through the expression of the lac Z gene For comparison the same numbers of unmodified Ad5 CMV LacZ were used free in solution The amount of infection increased with the increase in the number of viral particles that were added to the wells at the immobilization step Fig 3 However the amount of infection plateaued when 2 5 10 7viral particles were added to the well Thus when this number or greater of viral particles was added to the well at the immobilization step all of the cells that had been applied onto the virus coated solid surface were transduced When unmodified Ad5 CMV LacZ was used free in solution the saturation of infection was seen at 5 10 6viral particles per well Up to this number of viral particles per well used for immobilization for biotinylated Ad5 CMV LacZ or for transduction by free Ad5 CMV LacZ in solution immobilized adenoviral vectors showed lower infectivity than free viral vectors However as shown in Fig 2above only about 15 40 of biotinylated Ad5 CMV LacZ applied can actually be immobilized on streptavidin coated wells Thus if the infectivity is compared using the actual number of viral particles present in each well Ad5 CMV LacZ immobilized on streptavidin coated wells may possess an infectivity equivalent to that of free adenoviral vectors We next investigated how the infection of target cells by immobilized adenoviral vectors on the solid surface is affected by the natural permissivity of target cells for adenoviral infection determined by using free adenoviral vectors in solution Varying numbers of biotinylated Ad5 CMV LacZ prepared by treatment with 15 g ml sulfo NHS LC biotin were applied to streptavidin coated wells well diameter 0 64 cm for immobilization followed by the removal of unbound viral particles Target cells 8 10 3per well were cultured directly on the virus coated wells at 37 C for 48 h followed by the detection of the expression of the lac Z gene Unmodified Ad5 CMV LacZ were used free in solution for comparison Two cell lines were used as targets One cell line is D 17 which is highly permissive to adenoviral infection when viral vectors are used free in solution 10 The other cell line is C6 rat glioma cells which is less permissive to adenoviral infection 10 For D 17 cells the amount of infection increased steeply when the number of viral particles added to each well increased from 2 5 10 5to 2 5 10 6 Fig 4A for both immobilized and free adenoviral vectors although free Ad5 CMV LacZ showed higher infectivity than immobilized adenoviral vectors This result is consistent with that shown in Fig 3 For C6 cells no appreciable infection was seen with free Ad5 CMV LacZ even when 2 5 10 7viral particles were used per well Fig 4B In contrast when C6 cells were cultured directly on streptavidin coated wells on which Ad5 CMV LacZ had been immobilized considerable amounts of infection were seen when 2 5 10 6viral particles per well and greater were added to wells at the immobilization step This result suggests the possibility that adenoviral vectors which are immobilized on a solid surface can infect target cells that are otherwise poorly permissive to infection by free adenoviral vectors Provided that this notion is correct this enhanced infectivity of immobilized adenoviral vectors for poorly permissive target cells might be derived from the fact that target cells are forced to make direct contact with adenoviral vectors on the solid surface raising the local concentration of viral particles on the cell surface Thus unlike the infection of cells by free adenoviral vectors the collision of viral particles with the cell surface and the amount of the primary receptor for adenoviral vectors coxsackie adenovirus receptor CAR on target cells might not serve as the primary determinants for the permissivity of the cells However this enhanced infectivity of immobilized adenoviral vectors was not seen with all the cell lines tested that are poorly permissive to adenoviral infection For example the infectivity of immobilized Ad5 CMV LacZ was analyzed for two human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines HT 29 ATCC and COLO205 ATCC which are highly resistant to adenoviral infection 12 HT 29 expresses only a small amount of CAR on the cell surface Adenoviral particles can be taken up relatively efficiently by this cell line but this does not result in transduction of cells Thus the expression of transgenes is extremely poor 12 The expression of CAR on the surface of COLO205 cells is even lower than HT 29 cells and such CAR expression can be seen on only about 50 of COLO205 cells Similar to HT 29 cells the transduction efficiency of adenoviral vectors for COLO205 is extremely poor 12 The very low transduction efficiency of COLO205 by adenoviral vectors used free in solution was confirmed in our previous study 10 When up to 2 5 10 7viral particles were added to each well at the immobilization step or for transduction by free Ad5 CMV LacZ the infectivity of immobilized Ad5 CMV LacZ was only slightly higher than free Ad5 CMV LacZ in solution data not shown This might imply that the binding of viral particles to CAR is still required for the in situ infection of target cells on solid surfaces by immobilized adenoviral vectors Adenoviral vector spots on solid surfaces Successful in situ infection of target cells by adenoviral vectors on a solid surface shown above suggests that this technology could be used to control spatially the location of gene transduction on a solid surface by strategic placement of viral vectors There are several possible ways of immobilizing viral vectors at predetermined locations on the solid surface by using the strept avidin biotin interaction We used one such method to fabricate solid surfaces with adenoviral vectors immobilized as discrete spots with predetermined sizes In this method biotin moieties were initially attached covalently to discrete regions on a solid surface To the biotin moieties on the solid surface biotinylated adenoviral vectors were attached by using avidin as a molecular bridge between the biotin moieties on the solid surface and the viral surface Cell culture plates which are coated with poly D lysine well diameter 3 5 cm Biocoat Poly D Lysine Cellware 6 Well Plates Becton Dickinson Labware Bedford MA were used as the solid surface Sulfo NHS LC biotin was used to attach biotin moieties covalently to the primary amino groups of poly D lysine on the solid surface During the biotinylation reaction plastic rings inner diameter 1 4 cm and agarose were used to delimit the regions of biotinylation on the solid surface and to protect the remaining areas from biotinylation respectively After unreacted biotinylation reagent was removed excess Neutralite avidin a deglycosylated neutralized form of avidin Southern Biotechnology Associates Alabama AL was added which should bind to biotin moieties on the solid surface After the removal of unbound Neutralite avidin Ad5 CMV LacZ which had been biotinylated by treatment with 15 g ml sulfo NHS LC biotin as above was applied to the wells and allowed to bind to unoccupied biotin binding sites of Neutralite avidin that had been bound to biotin moieties on the solid surface D 17 cells were applied to the entire wells 2 5 10 5cells per well and cultured at 37 C for 48 h followed by the detection of the expression of the lac Z gene Fig 5 Specific transduction of target cells is seen only at the locations spots where biotin moieties were initially attached This demonstrates regio specific in situ transduction of target cells by adenoviral vectors at predetermined locations Very limited numbers of infected cells were present outside the biotinylation areas indicating that biotinylated Ad5 CMV LacZ was bound specifically to biotin moieties on the well surface via Neutralite avidin This result reveals that the ultimate spatial arrangements of transduced cells on a solid surface can be controlled and predetermined at the time of the fabrication of the solid surface during which time viral vectors can be attached to desired locations in any shapes patterns and sizes Discussion We previously reported a strategy similar to the one described in this study In this strategy biotinylated adenoviral vectors are immobilized on the surfaces of streptavidin coated microbeads with diameters up to a few micrometers 10 For such adenovirus microbead conjugates great enhancement in transduction efficiency was seen with several different cell lines including COLO205 the infection efficiency of which was not notably enhanced by adenoviral vectors immobilized on streptavidin coated wells in the present study The primary difference between the two strategies is derived from the size of solid surfaces streptavidin coated wells and streptavidin coated microbeads relative to target cells The sizes of adenovirus microbead conjugates are smaller than those of target cells Thus the entire adenovirus microbead conjugates can be taken up by cells Such internalization events appear to contribute substantially to the infectivity enhancement by virus microbead conjugates In contrast the dissociation of viral particles from the solid surface must occur for adenoviral vectors which are initially immobilized on streptavidin coated wells to be taken up by target cells This may be one possible explanation of why infectivity enhancement was seen with adenovirus microbead conjugates and was not with adenoviral vectors immobilized on streptavidin coated wells except for one cell line C6 Virus coated solid surfaces should offer a variety of both in vitro and in vivo applications One such in vitro application would be the creation of virus arrays for expression and functional analysis of genes 13 14 A recombinant viral vector library each clone of which carries a different gene could be immobilized in an ordered manner as discrete spots on a solid surface Onto the resulting virus array target cells are applied and cultured This should result in the expression of encoded genes in target cells in an array format in which each encoded gene should be expressed in a discrete cell spot while maintaining the original location of the viral vector spot in the virus array Thus expression and functional analysis of many different genes can potentially be performed with a single virus array for a given target cell line The use of viral vectors should offer enhanced efficiencies and versatility for the expression of cloned genes in various cell types than approaches using expression plasmids that are printed on solid surfaces 15 16 This might be particularly true to primary cells which often show poor expression of encoded genes when plasmid based expression vectors are used The availability of such viral vector libraries particularly those based on adenoviral vectors 17 18 should facilitate the realization of such applications Virus coated solid surfaces could also be used for in vitro tissue engineering applications for which the shapes and sizes of areas regions of genetically engineered cells can be predetermined two dimensionally by strategic placement and patterning of viral vectors on solid surfaces as exemplified in Fig 5 Such precise control of the shapes and sizes of areas regions of genetically engineered cells would be very difficult to achieve with free viral vectors which can diffuse freely in solution Virus coated solid surfaces could also be used in vivo for highly site specific delivery of viral particles to target tissues or cells through the direct application of virus coated solid surfaces to target sites The delivery of viral vectors in a solid surface associated form should eliminate the migration of viral particles from the administration site minimizing uncontrolled transduction of non target tissues For example a virus coated solid surface the size of which has been adjusted to the intended transduction site could be transplanted into a target tissue allowing the specific transduction of the target site by immobilized viral vectors with minimal infection of surrounding tissues As proposed for in vitro applications described above the primary advantage for such in vivo gene transfer applications would be that the shapes and sizes of areas regions of transduction sites can be predetermined by strategic placement and patterning of viral vectors on solid surfaces Conclusions We have devised a method of immobilizing adenoviral vectors tightly and stably on solid surfaces using the strept avidin biotin interaction while maintaining their ability to infect cells Such immobilized viral vectors can infect target cells in situ on solid surfaces with efficiencies equivalent to the same viral vectors used free in solution for the cell lines tested For one cell line C6 the infection efficiency by immobilized viral vectors was greater than the same viral vectors used free in solution which showed a limited ability to infect the target cells This strategy should be very useful for the development of a variety of both in vitro and in vivo applications including the creation of cell based expression arrays for proteomics and drug discovery and highly site specific delivery of transgenes for gene therapy and tissue engineering Methods Adenoviral vectors The recombinant adenoviral vectors used are Ad5 CMV LacZ Qbiogene which is derived from adenovirus serotype 5 with the deletion of the viral E1A E1B and E3 genes Ad5 CMV LacZ carries the bacterial lac Z

times with PBST Then the same number of fresh biotinylated Ad5 CMV LacZ was added to the well and incubated in the same manner followed by the collection of unbound viral particles and washing of the wells These steps were repeated several more times The unbound viral particle fraction collected after each addition cycle was subjected to infectivity analysis on D 17 cells to estimate the number of
