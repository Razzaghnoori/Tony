        you keep a budget     um yes i do   okay how how do you work that   well usually it works out pretty well   does it   um i try to project out um right now i project out six months   oh   you know i have my fixed monthly bills and i know how much they are     right  uhhuh   and uh i have a percentage of my savings that i attempt to take off the top   oh   not unless i have something come up thats unusual that i was unexpected and then i may have to go into savings   uhhuh oh   and   well that seems to work out pretty good   kind of the formula i use i use uh ninety percent of my check   oh   and then i retain ten percent and if i dont use it then it goes into savings also   for savings oh is it is it hard to set it up for the six month period rather than just a month or   well my monthly bills are pretty consistent you know you have your house payments the same every month uh car payments are the same you know when your insurance is due   oh right uhhuh so in fact   so you budget all that in thats why a lot of times i only use ninety percent of my salary because some months ill have insurance   it might uhhuh   um two or three times a year   right   and i need that extra money and to take it out of savings at that point   oh so really when youre doing it it probably is just as easy to do it for the six month period rather than just a month at a time oh   sure umhum a month at a time is not a really a big picture of whats going on in your life because it doesnt give you any flexibility as far as uh unforeseen situations or something coming down the road that you know is coming down the road that you need to save for   no uhhuh oh right and then also i mean thats if you do it monthly thats twelve times you have to sit down and figure it out and you could save all that   yeah i do it uh twice a year and um you know i could adjust it every month thats no big deal   uhhuh uhhuh   but uh i just finished out December and uh when i was done with it i threw it away and i already had January through July made out   umhum so you do it January to July and then July to December oh oh does now how did you say you worked your savings do you take your savings right off   umhum yeah i take the savings right off the top i pay myself first   uhhuh   im the type of individual that uh you know i cant i have to put something back for myself to feel like im doing my job   uhhuh right right   its my motivator   and how much at what percentage do you save   i save about fifteen percent   oh thats great   out of what out of my savings account not as well as the Japanese do   well that thats fairly good do you get paid once a month or by twice a month   twice a month uh uh actually every other week so twenty six checks   every two weeks during the year oh thats great we   yeah   so twice a year i pick up an extra check also   oh thats right so that helps out   uhhuh   gives you a bit there oh   how do you all do yours   well we we dont really do very well we have never sat down and made out a formal budget we keep saying you know were going to do this were going to do this we we take our savings right out  right out first and put you know put it away and then   umhum   we just uh were thats terrible but we just kind of spend what we need thats right thats right we take the savings out and uh you know put that in and then   spend whats left over huh   spend what whats left over like you said and i know we if we keep but we just dont know how to get down and get started i guess trying to decide how much goes where and you know   umhum theres really no certain formula that you can say well i i wanna say this much and im gonna spend this much for the house and   uhhuh   uh im kind of in a situation right now that my our children are grown and theyre gone so uh   oh   you know and the house is almost paid for so were in pretty good shape   oh oh thats great now how did you get started when you started doing have you always done a budget or what   uh weve done them for about fifteen years   about fifteen years oh so quite a while huh did you just sit down and decide   yeah yeah   this much is this much is gonna go here and the thing we have a hard time with was you know like how much for the groceries and how much for the clothes and how much for   well one thing we do about the groceries and when and we just got back from the grocery store and weve been doing this for a long time and we know exactly how much we spend at the grocery store because when we come home we write it down   umhum oh oh   so in a given month we know that we spent two hundred and fifty dollars or four hundred dollars or whatever it is and if its four hundred dollars we look at it and say well why did we spend four hundred dollars   uhhuh oh   and we spent four hundred dollars this month because or last month because uh we had several Christmas parties   December right right   so but we know approximately how much our our monthly grocery bill is you know and and you should be able to do that too within   umhum   ten or fifteen percent of what uh what you spend once you get a track record   right if we just huh so   and once you establish your track record   so what
