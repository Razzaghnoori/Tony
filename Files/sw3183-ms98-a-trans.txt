            well were gonna be talking about vacations i guess huh  where have you been recently   right right i have been well i go quite a bit i travel about forty percent of my time but my vacations  my favorite spot is Las Vegas yeah   Las Vegas well my dad goes there but i am not a betting man ive been there one time and ill be honest i did not enjoy it no no   really i are there any particular reason youre not into gambling or   i i guess just because im not that type of a person im im a CPA and i im very conservative with my money and i just did to me that was not a vacation   i see   uh i now im a big world traveler i enjoy traveling the world i just got back from Hawaii uh this past July uh the prior year before that id been to uh Tokyo Disneyland uh ive been ive got a trip coming up next year im going to the EuroDisney   oh really in France   uh thats gonna be in Paris France were going there in July   yes uhhuh   and at the same time were also gonna go visit Norway ive always wanted to go see the Fjords of Norway i just love have have have you ever been on a cruise to um Alaska   umhum no uh my inlaws have and i i stay stay steer away from boats as much as possible only because i cant take it   okay well i tell you what if i possibly can uh theres a spot that i would love to encourage you to go visit   really   my father same way he had absolutely no desire to be around a boat he says man i get seasick i dont like it   umhum   the thing that is so wonderful about the Alaskan cruise it is on what they call the inside passage   right right exactly   youre not in the ocean you are in a river almost   umhum   only only the only thing you have are cliffs on the left and cliffs on the right side and were talking about five hundred foot thousand foot cliffs absolutely gorgeous and   i yes everything i see that they brought back it i i definitely agree   and and and and every yeah and every thirty yards here comes another uh waterfall which is nothing more than the melting snow   umhum   thats just more glorious than the last one it is absolutely fantastic and with those cliffs the sunsets are just oh my goodness uh for me and my wife it was probably the most romantic one week trip i have ever ever taken   really   and the food  the food on we were on uh Princess Cruise Lines and the food was just out of this world   oh yes yes i its it cruises from what i understand are are really the way to go and someday someday i will convince my or convince myself that i can handle it and i will surprise my wife and and book a cruise  uh i much definitely prefer warmer climates than Alaska so i would probably head for the Caribbean   well if that be the case i was gonna say you can go to the Caribbean but the now the problem with the Caribbean though now youve got the ocean and ive been to the Caribbean three times now you got the ocean and if you have a motion sickness problem now they have these little patches you can put behind your ear   umhum ive used those right   uh youd wanna use those but the same time though you youre not going to get as pleasant of a ride as you would on that Alaskan cruise   umhum interesting interesting i never i really never thought of that thats pretty good to know   uh but and and and there there are parts especially when you get close to Cuba there are the water can get very very rough   umhum yeah   really can  but uh otherwise as far as vacation ive ive course i see i guess i like the cold weather i ive been up to New England and i thought that was fantastic   yeah and this is one spot you know being in Ohio the New England states are not that far uh that is one thing that really has not interested us we do like the Virginias the Carolinas Carolina   um now oh have you have you been on the Blue Ridge Parkway oh wow now thats fantastic   oh yes several times yeah and uh we next week were leaving for New Orleans  and im i i do prefer the warmer the warmer   see im a Louisiana boy so i know where youre talking about there   umhum  but uh and i loved Hawaii   yes now that was my first trip ive ever been to Hawaii yes   uh we had bought really it its its uh its just beautiful i just i would be very happy staying in Hawaii and becoming a beachcomber when i retire which isnt too far off which is something i might wanna consider but uh   well stay away from the Texas coastlines Texas doesnt have anything for you   i you know ive ive been tempted ive gotten down as far as San Antonio but ive never gone down to uh really to the coastline   yeah the the coastline yeah the coastline here is the pits uh theres theres much better in Florida much much better uh other places Hawaii was wonderful that was great   yeah so uhhuh i love it yes i  that   uh i thought Waikiki Beach was as nice of a of a beach as i ever wanna see and we went to four different islands we had a great time   umhum yes it is and you have to do that uh people that go and they only go to one area you have to see it all   well tell you what ive got a ive got a phone ringing on the other line i better go answer it ive enjoyed talking to you though catch you later byebye   yes very good well its nice talking to you okay umhum byebye
