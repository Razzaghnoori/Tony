        um       a lot of companies now are are using uh drug testing uh paraphernalia and drug testing situations to to root out the the either uh yeah elementary or intermediate or advanced uh drug users   uhhuh   and uh i know that that government is uh you know gives drug tests uh to all new entrants all new applicants applicants coming into government   uhhuh   and and i quite frankly dont see anything wrong with it i im guess im not a good civil libertarian       and and i i feel as though uh that uh uh you know that if you you are a drug user you have a hidden agenda thats difficult unless you really go into a deep background of course were  being involved in my organization uh we we have deep background checks and   sure sure   and so uh but but you but sometimes you know drug use can can escape that and uh i have absolutely no compunction about uh using any and all means to to uh uh you know work out figure out who has a drug program or has a drug problem   hm uhhuh   and uh and putting that guy into into therapy to or whatever it is to to you know break this uh uh activity of course if hes fallen in love with drugs and there isnt anything but getting stoned or high is is the only thing in life that seems be meaningful then maybe there is no hope   yeah   whats your uh feeling   um well i guess i i guess im probably a little more toward toward the other direction um       well i guess mainly because um its i well like theres two sides to it i guess um one is that um if youre coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug alcohol whatever or you know even if its smoking inhibits you know your ability to function then i i think that that you know i dont have any problem at all with testing that individual you know on the spot um but i guess i feel more like whatever youre doing in your own private life is your own private business um and i guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that uh things like drug laws seem to come and go you know we had prohibition for awhile and then we didnt have prohibition um  you know weve had i guess laws against uh you know various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years i guess maybe a little longer   umhum well i think uh the drug the laws on uh uh uh the first morphine laws were were like ninety or nineteen ten or nineteen five something like that   yeah well so eighty eighty eighty years or so yeah   yeah   um so i you know its its hard to i guess for me to justify what seems seems like you know basically a breach of the First Amendment you know freedom from uh search and seizure you you know um on something that may or may not stand as a law you know fifty years from now or even twenty or ten who knows   well the thing of it is the the that that that that is uh uh in in many respects uh   i mean prohibition certainly didnt last   uh you know just just a i think an over simplification i i think there there the the theres so much criminal activity   well but you got to look at prohibition though you had the same problems there right   uh that that people go into to to support drug habit yeah you know they they support drug habits with uh with uh you you know with things like uh you know burglary or or prostitution or stuff like that yeah yeah   oh yeah sure well it goes back to the again if you look at prohibition i mean because its illegal it costs more if it was legal i mean face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what ten or twenty dollars an ounce   yeah i i i must admit that   and clearly if youre into Coke and all you wanna do is you know snort your brains out all day long if it was legal you could do it real cheap and you know youd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it   hm yeah   but yeah get um   yeah i i must must admit that the the production costs of of these drugs are are zippo compared to the street market costs and the   oh yeah well thats why theres you know why theres people dealing it because theres money in it you know theres a ridiculous amounts of money in it   and the costs to society yeah but i i i i think that that the that you know the  being in law enforcement you know is that that  im i probably have a kind of a draconian Philistine attitude toward it and but but the uh       uh i i really feel as though the interdiction effort is is as soon as you you get rid of one goon thats thats thats involved in drugs  yeah and then another another one will jump up   oh yeah interdictions hopeless i mean theres no way youre ever gonna win that   but we we see   the tighter you squeeze the more the price goes up so the more incentive there is i mean thats a losing fight   yeah as as as as as soon as we we wind up uh uh you know uh well i think if we could just destroy the market by destroying the demand but but people will wanna get get stoned and i i dont see that   yeah yeah well yeah it goes back to you know what right what can society impose on people i mean can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen i dont think you can i mean   yeah   you know im you know was raised with the very strong Bible work ethic so you know im one of these you know ten twelve fifteen twenty hour a day type people   umhum   so you know yeah i i can really relate to yeah everybody ought to do their own share you know i dont have any you know love lost for people who are on the public dole just because theyre too lazy to get a job or or that kind of stuff   umhum   but you know
