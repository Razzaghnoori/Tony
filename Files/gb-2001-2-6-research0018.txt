 Background Olfaction is a major neurosensory function by which mammals investigate the external chemical environment The initial step in odor identification is interaction of an odorant molecule with olfactory odorant receptors ORs expressed at the surface of cilia of chemosensory olfactory neurons in the olfactory epithelium Seven transmembrane ORs first identified in 1991 1 are the largest vertebrate gene family comprising as many as 1 000 genes reviewed in 2 3 4 5 6 Mammalian ORs are classical G protein coupled receptors belonging to Class I or A which also includes opsins and catecholamine receptors 7 Each olfactory neuron appears to express a single type of OR 8 9 10 implying a sophisticated mechanism of OR gene choice Another intriguing feature of olfaction is combinatorial recognition of odorants Each receptor recognizes multiple odorants and each odorant binds to multiple receptors to generate specific activation patterns for each of a vast number of distinct smells 10 The genes encoding ORs are devoid of introns within their coding regions 1 11 Mammalian OR genes are typically organized in clusters of ten or more members and located on many chromosomes 12 13 14 The repertoire of human OR hOR genes contains a large fraction of pseudogenes suggesting that olfaction became less important in the course of primate evolution Recent studies indicate that some 70 of all hOR genes may be pseudogenes compared with fewer than 5 in rodents or lower primates 15 16 Analyses of incomplete compilations of hORs in particular approximately 150 full length receptor genes 17 18 have recently been published A larger annotated set of hOR genes is available as an online database 19 The very recent milestone publication of the first draft of the human genome sequence by two groups 20 21 opens up the possibility of detailed and complete identification mapping and analysis of OR genes and their products in the near future One of these groups reported that the human genome contains 906 OR genes of which approximately 60 appear to be pseudogenes 20 Many alternative nomenclatures for hORs including a comprehensive phylogenetic classification developed at the Weizmann Institute 17 22 have been proposed by various labs over the past few years The identification cloning and sequence based classification and analysis of candidate hORs are essential prerequisites for rational structure function studies of this vast receptor family Our goal was to identify the complete repertoire of hOR genes encoding full length receptors The approach was to carry out reiterative homology based searches of GenBank DNA particularly recently available unannotated raw sequences and to compile hOR sequences already present in other public databases We report here the identification and cloning of 347 putative full length hOR receptor genes which we believe accounts for nearly the entire repertoire of functional hORs We also present a comparative sequence analysis of the predicted OR gene products and propose a new nomenclature for candidate hORs Results and discussion Sequence database mining and odorant receptor cloning The general strategy for the search for full length hOR genes is shown in Figure 1 It was based on absence of introns in coding sequences of mammalian ORs 1 11 as well as high overall sequence similarity and the presence of several highly conserved sequence motifs in all known mammalian ORs 2 The first step was to identify all currently known hOR sequences by extensive keyword and homology based searches of several public DNA and protein sequence databases see Materials and methods The resulting several hundred sequences were compared with each other by BLAST and multiple sequence alignments DNA and protein entries were matched All duplicates were cross referenced and apparent pseudogenes having frameshifts deletions and other defects obviously incompatible with receptor function were eliminated This initial screen identified approximately 90 bona fide full length according to criteria described below hOR genes and a large number of candidate sequence fragments The next step was identification of additional members of the family by exhaustive iterative homology searches of translated human genomic sequence databases particularly the raw unannotated high throughput genomic sequences HTGS using protein queries corresponding to the known hORs As the number of identified receptors grew additional diverse sequences were added to the query list to capture additional ORs in databases Genomic sequences containing areas of significant homology to ORs were subjected to open reading frame ORF searches Several hundred identified ORFs of sufficient length 250 amino acids were translated and compared to known ORs Three criteria were used to select putative ORs from this set high overall sequence similarity the presence of seven predicted transmembrane TM regions and the presence of multiple positionally conserved sequence motifs described in Materials and methods that serve as signatures of this gene family The basic criteria for recognizing a particular OR gene as encoding a full length functional receptor candidate were the presence of an uninterrupted ORF starting with an ATG codon and a complete seven transmembrane unit A few putative ORs were discarded from the final set because they contained structural features deemed to be incompatible with receptor function such as insertions of multiple nucleotide sequence repeats in their ORFs These are intentionally minimalist criteria designed to exclude apparent OR pseudogenes but not cryptic pseudogenes such as those having defects on the level of transcription or splicing or containing subtle but functionally disruptive mutations in receptor coding region For example human OR17 24 hOR17 01 01 in our nomenclature as discussed below classified by others 23 as a probable pseudogene on the basis of deviations from other ORs in its carboxyl terminus and 5 untranslated region UTR sequence is considered a regular candidate OR according to our analysis It has to be noted that the final assignment of OR gene or pseudogene status must be based on functional expression data As a result of the search described above 347 putative full length OR genes have been identified in the human genome This number includes all the previously known annotated hOR sequences extracted from the public databases It is feasible that a small number of full length hORs escaped detection because of frameshifts or other sequencing or assembly errors in the corresponding HTGS entries We are continuing routine searches using updated versions of genomic sequences to identify such cases Because of the very high occurrence of OR pseudogenes in humans 15 16 and the presence of ORs in highly variable parts of human genome 13 24 it is also possible that some polymorphic members of this gene family exist in the human population in both intact and defective allelic forms A small subset of identified OR ORFs was discarded because of such defects as partial deletions of TM1 or TM7 regions The argument can be made that these OR genes could encode functional receptors In addition it was hypothesized that odorant reception may also be mediated by receptors of a completely different class such as guanylate cyclases 25 These caveats notwithstanding we estimate that we have identified at least 90 95 of all full length prototypical ORs in the human genome Cloning coding regions of full length human olfactory receptor genes To validate sequences extracted by genomic database mining all hOR gene coding sequences described in this paper were cloned by direct genomic PCR using mixed DNA from ten individuals as a template and oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the amino and carboxy terminal sequences of the corresponding ORFs An average of eight independent clones for each receptor were isolated and sequenced in their entirety While single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs were detected in many hORs data not shown the sequencing data essentially confirmed correct identification of full length OR encoding ORFs Sequences shown in the multiple sequence alignment Figure 2 are those extracted from genomic sequence database entries Studies of human OR gene and pseudogene sequences covering approximately 150 full length receptor genes 17 18 were recently published A larger set of annotated putative human OR genes identified by an automated search algorithm became very recently accessible through a worldwide web interface 19 A detailed comparison and cross referencing of this overlapping set of data with the output of our independent database mining and genomic cloning effort allowed us to verify the hOR selection reported in this paper The sets of the hORs identified by us and the other group strongly overlap which corroborates the essentially complete overview of the hOR repertoire We found differences between our data and those in the HORDE database however These include 29 hOR genes that are apparently identified as pseudogenes in the HORDE database but encode functional hOR candidates by our analysis as well as 10 hORs not found in HORDE see Materials and methods Our extensive cloning and sequencing data supported the conclusions presented here Differences are probably caused by DNA sequencing errors in raw high throughput genomic sequence Other differences include single nucleotide amino acid changes as well as discrepancies in the definition of amino and carboxyl termini for some ORs An important caveat in interpreting these discrepancies is an apparent evolutionary decline in the human olfactory apparatus Many specific anosmias inabilities to smell a particular odorant have been identified in humans 26 27 Although the molecular basis for these anosmias is not currently known all or some of them could be caused by hereditary OR defects The high proportion of hOR pseudogenes 15 16 and the unusually high rate of SNPs in hORs 28 point to significant variability in the composition of the functional OR repertoire in the human population More research is needed to clarify these issues and to generate the final catalog of functional hORs Genomic localization and general features of hORs It has been previously demonstrated that members of the hOR gene family are distributed on all but a few human chromosomes Through fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis Rouquier 15 showed that OR sequences reside at more than 25 locations in the human genome and that the human genome has accumulated a striking number of dysfunctional copies 72 of these sequences were found to be pseudogenes We identified a total of 347 putative functional hOR genes located in multiple clusters on all human chromosomes except for 2 4 18 20 21 and Y with the majority 155 hORs on chromosome 11 Chromosome 11 is followed in frequency by chromosome 1 42 ORs 9 26 ORs and 6 24 ORs By contrast chromosomes 10 22 and X seem to carry only a single full length OR gene Full length hOR genes are present in more than 50 distinct clusters and are interspersed with pseudogene OR sequences to a variable degree data not shown The distribution of hORs from the two most abundant sources chromosomes 11 and 1 in the phylogenetic tree of the OR repertoire is illustrated in Figure 3 While it does reveal some phylogenetic superclusters of ORs the chromosome specific subsets of ORs are typically scattered across the phylogenetic tree In addition to harboring almost half of the functional OR candidates chromosome 11 contains an intriguing large cluster of 53 full length OR genes families 11 01 through 11 20 in Figure 2 which is evolutionarily distinct from the rest of the repertoire and is located near the telomeric end of chromosome 11 Despite the phylogenetic uniqueness this subgroup has strongly conserved sequence signature motifs of ORs The remainder of ORs from chromosome 11 are clustered in the centromeric region q11 12 or at the other end of the chromosome q24 25 Although the available information on genomic localization of the OR genes was extracted from the Human Genome Project data and used in developing OR nomenclature see below mapping the exact chromosomal position of each OR gene or studying their cluster organization was not the goal of this study Instead our focus was on identification and comparative analysis of putative full length hOR sequences produced by conceptual translation of the corresponding genomic OR ORFs Whereas the amino acid identity between a few of the most distant human ORs is as low as 20 the average identity for a random pair of hORs is in the 35 40 range This lower limit of sequence identity within the hOR family is similar to that reported for candidate Drosophila OR genes 29 and chemosensory receptors of Caenorhabditis elegans 30 An average predicted hOR is approximately 315 amino acids long whereas the shortest OR included in the list of full length receptors according to our criteria is 291 amino acids hORo6 12 03 Uncertainty in determining exact amino termini for many ORs see below makes it difficult to identify the longest receptor sequence however one hOR hOR19 03 01 is at least 355 amino acids long Strictly speaking a candidate hOR would be the most appropriate designation for a protein belonging to this structurally distinct human G protein coupled receptor family as their odorant detecting function has not yet been reported As pointed out in a recent review 3 very little experimental data exists on the expression of OR genes in human olfactory sensory neurons 12 31 Some studies indicate that OR genes can be expressed in tissues other than the olfactory epithelium suggesting potential alternative biological roles for this class of chemosensory receptors Expression of various ORs was reported in human and murine erythroid cells 32 developing rat heart 33 avian notochord 34 and lingual epithelium 35 The best experimentally documented case is the existence of a large subset of mammalian ORs transcribed in testes and expressed on the surface of mature spermatozoa suggesting a possible role for ORs in sperm chemotaxis 36 37 38 39 It has been also hypothesized that olfactory receptors might provide molecular codes for cell cell recognition in development and embryogenesis 40 including providing guidance for olfactory bulb glomeruli targeting by chemosensory neurons 9 Conserved sequence motifs Transmembrane domains and loops Strong sequence conservation is apparent in the intracellular loops probably reflecting interactions of ORs with common intracellular partners such as G olf 45 One such previously described conserved motif located at the junction of transmembrane domain TM 3 and intracellular loop IC 2 and incorporating E DRY sequence conserved in all G protein coupled receptors is MAYDRYVAIC single letter amino acid notation The highly conserved motif KAFSTCXSH X is any amino acid in IC3 contains one of the cysteines from the intracellular pair conserved in many G protein coupled receptors as well as serines and threonines potentially involved in phosphorylation events as discussed below Other highly conserved regions include TM1 TM2 and TM7 the last two domains are routinely used in the design of family specific degenerate oligonucleotide primers for PCR amplification of ORs Most of the sequence variability is observed in extracellular loops EC1 and EC3 membrane spanning domains TM4 TM5 and to a lesser degree TM3 and TM6 as well as in the extreme amino and carboxyl termini of the receptors not shown in Figure 4 Structural diversity of these extracellular loops and transmembrane domains is believed to reflect ligand binding specificity of ORs 1 42 One model of a ligand binding pocket in ORs stipulates the existence of 20 variable amino acid residues on transmembrane helices 3 4 and 5 that constitute the putative ligand complementarity determining region 5 42 Taking into account the high observed sequence variability Figures 2 4 in additional OR domains known to be involved in ligand recognition in other G protein coupled receptors 46 47 such as TM6 and extracellular loops that model may not be sufficient to provide a complete description of odorant binding specificity determinants Almost all G protein coupled receptors contain a highly conserved cysteine in EC1 and another in EC2 There is direct and circumstantial evidence that the residues form an intra or inter molecular disulfide bond in many G protein coupled receptors and in some cases these are critical for their ligand recognition and membrane trafficking 48 49 50 OR sequences contain one highly conserved cysteine in EC1 and three in EC2 an unusual feature shared by only a few G protein coupled receptors such as chemokine or P2Y1 receptors which have an additional pair of disulfide forming cysteines in the amino terminus and EC3 50 51 These four highly conserved cysteines suggest that two disulfide bonds may be present on the extracellular surface of ORs Like other G protein coupled receptors ORs also contain a conserved pair of cysteine residues in IC1 and IC2 Figures 2 4 Amino termini Olfactory receptors have short approximately 25 30 amino acids extracellular amino termini that do not have homology to traditional cleavable leader peptides A strongly conserved stretch of unknown functional significance EF I L LLG L F is located approximately ten amino acids upstream of the predicted first transmembrane region Like other G protein coupled receptors ORs contain consensus sequences NXS T for N linked glycosylation near their amino termini and in EC1 Almost every OR has a single predicted amino terminal N glycosylation site and approximately 5 of the repertoire contains a consensus glycosylation site in EC1 whereas none are detected in EC2 A number of ORs also contain NXC motifs in the same locations It was recently suggested that this motif occurring in some murine ORs is a possible novel N linked glycosylation site 52 It has to be noted that exact prediction of amino terminal sequences of hORs based on genomic sequence information is not always clear cut While the OR coding sequences are generally believed to be intronless there is at least one report of an exception to this rule resulting in an amino terminal sequence heterogeneity 38 In addition 5 UTR introns in OR genes are typically located very close to the OR coding region 53 Extensive alternative splicing of 5 UTRs of OR mRNAs have been described 38 54 Therefore both the straightforward conceptual translation of the longest OR ORF derived from genomic sequence as well as use of intron exon prediction programs may result in incorrect identification of OR amino termini The presence of a potential splice acceptor site homology to other ORs and an initiating ATG sequence context conducive to in vivo translation 55 were taken into consideration to predict amino terminal OR protein sequences in our analysis Carboxyl termini Predicted carboxyl termini of the ORs are short with an average length of about 21 amino acids and have significant similarity in their TM7 proximal half starting with the highly conserved consensus RNK motif immediately adjacent to TM7 Many class I G protein coupled receptors including rhodopsin and the 2 adrenergic receptor contain one or two cysteine residues in their carboxyl termini about 12 amino acids from the end of TM7 These correspond to a putative palmitoylation site which allows formation of a fourth cytoplasmic loop that maybe involved in G protein coupling Only 26 of the human ORs have one or more cysteines in their carboxy terminal regions suggesting that carboxy terminal palmitoylation if it occurs is not general for ORs An additional feature of OR carboxyl termini is a high content of positively charged amino acid residues occurring in a positionally conserved pattern a not uncommon feature of many other G protein coupled receptors Yet another typical feature of many of these receptors is the presence of multiple serine and threonine residues in their carboxyl termini and IC3 that serve as phosphorylation sites for G protein coupled receptor kinases GRKs as well as protein kinases C PKC and A PKA a mechanism involved in agonist dependent desensitization of the receptors Mammalian ORs are known to undergo rapid desensitization after odorant stimulation 56 and GRK3 has been implicated in this process 57 58 Approximately 20 of the ORs do not have any serine or threonine residues in their carboxyl termini whereas the remaining 80 have an average of more than two such residues most of which are located in the vicinity of positively charged amino acids and conform to consensus sequences for phosphorylation by PKC or PKA In addition the short third intracellular loop of all ORs contains four to five highly positionally conserved serine or threonine residues interspersed with four equally conserved basic amino acids comprising a good potential site for phosphorylation A proposed nomenclature for functional human olfactory receptor candidates By analogy with the classical examples of pharmacology based nomenclatures of some well studied G protein coupled receptor families a nomenclature of functional olfactory receptors could be based on their odorant specificity As such information is currently almost nonexistent for human ORs other criteria such as the chromosomal localization of their genes similarly to the recently proposed D melanogaster OR nomenclature 59 or their structural phylogenetic analysis as proposed for mammalian ORs 17 22 should be used We suggest an alternative hybrid nomenclature reflecting both phylogenetic clustering of OR gene products and their chromosomal localization It is conceivable that phylogenetic closeness and high sequence similarity of ORs may reflect similarity in their ligand specificities On the other hand co localization of a subset of OR genes in a particular genomic cluster might indicate their coordinate regulation and common biological function One possible example of the latter is the OR gene cluster located on human chromosome 6 at the telomeric end of the HLA complex region It has been shown recently that OR members from this cluster exhibit unusually high allelic variability similar to the major histocompatibility complex MHC genes 24 It is hypothesized that this group of human ORs could be functionally linked to MHC and involved in MHC mediated mate preferences 60 61 Another relevant example is the discovery of a block of human OR genes at least one of which OR7501 hOR19 06 01 encodes a potentially functional receptor in subtelomeric regions that are present in 7 to 11 similar copies on several chromosomes 13 The presence of OR genes in these polymorphically multiplied rearrangement prone areas hints at a higher level complexity and individual variations in OR repertoire We generated phylogenetic trees using the neighbor joining algorithm 62 as implemented in the two standard phylogenetic analysis software packages ClustalX 63 64 and Phylip 65 In both cases the dataset was bootstrapped 66 to provide the statistical estimation of the reliability of the resulting tree topology Two resulting dendrograms having very similar topology were used to identify OR clusters and assign the receptors to a particular family A phylogenetic dendrogram derived from comparison of full length OR protein sequences is shown in Figure 5 with the families bracketed Strong phylogenetic clustering supported by the bootstrap tests typically only the bootstrap values higher than 50 were considered significant as well as high sequence similarity 40 identity were used as a main criterion for grouping receptors into a particular family The second criterion for defining a family was common chromosomal localization including co localization in a particular genomic locus if known at the time of analysis It is believed that local tandem gene duplication is a common mechanism of OR evolution from common predecessors Not surprisingly there is a strong correlation between localization of an OR in a particular chromosomal cluster and its position in a phylogenetic dendrogram derived from comparison of full length OR protein sequences Figure 5 However in a number of cases ORs from different chromosomal loci converge in a phylogenetic cluster implying recent gene duplication with interchromosomal insertion events from a distant region of the genome As a result of this branching analysis the family of 347 hORs was subdivided into 119 families from 1 to 14 members in each Figure 5 The minimum pairwise intrafamily amino acid identity is 43 and the average minimum amino acid identity within all of the 77 families having more than one member is 62 Each chromosome specific subset of hORs consists of 1 to 50 for chromosome 11 independently numbered families whereby each chromosome has family 1 for example Members of each family are numbered sequentially from 1 An example of our nomenclature is hOR11 01 02 which represents a human olfactory receptor located on chromosome 11 from family 1 and which is member 2 of the family Numerous ways of classifying ORs on the basis of cloning technique clone name or genomic location have been put forward The most advanced and consistent existing nomenclature which includes both genes and pseudogenes and is implemented in the HORDE database is based solely on phylogenetic clustering with consequent division of ORs into families and subfamilies 17 22 According to this nomenclature receptor sequences with 40 or more amino acid identity are considered members of the same family whereas those sharing 60 or more identity constitute a subfamily We believe that at least in some cases OR names in our nomenclature carry more biologically relevant information and could be more rational Consider for example receptors hOR22 01 01 hOR11H1 hOR14 03 01 hOR11H4 hOR14 03 02 hOR11H6 and hOR14 03 03 hOR11G2 where the HORDE names are in parentheses According to our nomenclature see Figure 5 these four receptors form two complete families 22 01 with one member located on chromosome 22 and 14 03 with three chromosome 14 members located in a single gene cluster According to the HORDE division all four receptors belong to the family 11 Three ORs including the one from chromosome 22 and two from chromosome 14 fall into subfamily H whereas the remaining chromosome 14 OR belongs to subfamily G In other cases similar OR grouping is provided by both nomenclatures Nevertheless even for those cases the names in our nomenclature carry information about the chromosome of origin for a given OR instead of an arbitrary sub family name An added convenience of the nomenclature we are proposing is the straightforward computer friendly format which would facilitate the handling of hundreds of OR sequences It allows encoding up to 99 OR subfamilies of 99 members for each chromosome possibly including polymorphic OR forms as well as easy sorting of receptor lists For the reasons discussed earlier some additional functional hOR candidates are likely to be identified in the future and will have to be accommodated by the nomenclature It may also need to be refined as we learn more about the biological function and specificity of olfactory receptors and the detailed genomic mapping of OR clusters We believe however that the OR nomenclature we describe represents a comprehensive convenient and possibly more biologically relevant alternative to the existing OR classifications Conclusions Identification and cloning of the functional hOR repertoire creates a basis for addressing many unresolved issues in human olfaction Most importantly in conjunction with robust heterologous expression and assay systems and high throughput screening of odorant libraries it will ultimately lead to understanding of structure function relationships and small molecule recognition by this large group of G protein coupled receptors The impact of genetic polymorphism of ORs on differential olfactory perception in the human population is another exciting topic Global comparative analysis of functional hOR candidate gene and pseudogene repertoires as well as of repertoires of human and murine ORs will shed light on the evolution of the human olfactory apparatus and its biological consequences Materials and methods Sequence database mining Human OR gene sequences were extracted from the following online public sequence databases National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI protein and DNA database resources 67 queried via several interfaces including LocusLink UniGene Entrez and BLAST the Human Olfactory Receptor Data Exploratorium HORDE at the Weizmann Institute Israel 17 19 and the Olfactory Receptor Database ORDB at Yale University 41 68 69 Similarity based searches for putative hOR gene sequences were performed by querying NR HTGS EST GSS and STS divisions of GenBank using the tblastn and blastp search algorithms 70 The blastp searches were run using default parameters with the expect value cut off of 1 10 8 ORFs in DNA sequences were identified and analyzed using the GeneQuest program LaserGene DNASTAR All ORFs longer than 250 amino acids were conceptually translated and compared to the entirety of GenBank by the tblastn and blastp searches The presence of no fewer than five of the following consensus sequence signature motifs see Figure 4 was used as a criterion for recognizing ORs EF I L LLG L F upstream of TM1 PMYFFL

Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis Multiple sequence alignments were constructed with ClustalX 63 64 The alignments were slightly modified to adjust the gap positions by visual inspection Alignment editing and shading was done using GeneDoc Multiple Sequence Alignment Editor 71 and BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor 72 Phylogenetic analysis was done using either ClustalX or Phylip 3 6 65 software using the neighbor joining method 62 and standard parameters The resulting datasets were subjected to 1 000 Clustal or 100 Phylip rounds of bootstrapping 66 to evaluate the statistical significance of the consensus tree topologies To root the phylogenetic trees the human melanocortin receptor 4 sequence was used as an outgroup Tree representations were constructed using TreeView 73 and TreeExplorer K Tamura personal communication Sequence logos of hORs were generated using a web based program developed by Jan Gorodkin 74 For most analyses short parts of the receptor sequences corresponding to the extreme amino termini upstream of the conserved predicted N linked glycosylation site and carboxyl termini beyond 12 amino acids residues downstream of TM7 were deleted to avoid length heterogeneity in the compared sequences No significant sequence conservation was observed in these short removed receptor fragments of variable lengths Similarly all alignment gap positions where more than 95 of all ORs had a gap were deleted before the sequence logo generation The SpliceView intron exon boundary prediction program 75 76 was used to identify potential splice sites in predicted 5 UTRs of OR mRNAs Positions of transmembrane domains in ORs were predicted using the PHD topology routine 77 at PredictProtein server at EMBL Heidelberg 78 Genomic PCR and cloning Human genomic DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction PCR usinq Taq polymerase HotStarTaq Qiagen and oligonucleotide primers based on sequences corresponding to the extreme amino and carboxy terminal
