 Background Given the epidemiology of smoking initiation a great deal of public health policy and programmatic attention has been directed at youth smoking in the United States 1 Approximately 80 of tobacco users initiate use before 18 years of age and if this trend in early initiation of cigarette smoking continues estimates are that 5 million children aged less than 18 years who are alive today will die prematurely as adults 2 In an effort to discourage initiation of tobacco use several youth tobacco education programs have been created and are currently available for presentation to elementary school students Many of these approaches are school based programs and a number are cited in the evidence based literature as demonstrations of what actually works Surprisingly however despite some good research studies and important dissemination efforts by several government agencies relatively few schools appear to have adopted any of the recommendations Clearly much additional work is needed to increase the use of evidence based prevention approaches in school settings as well as doing a better Job of communicating the results of research to the media and in turn to the general public 3 A large number of school based programs have been implemented over the last several years with most of those efforts targeting elementary and or middle school students The evaluation results of several meta analyses of tobacco and other drug prevention programs strongly suggest that approaches based on the social influence resistance model are the most effective Additionally programs that are led by peers and that are more interactive and allow for active rather than passive learning have produced the best results 4 5 6 Several individual studies have highlighted mechanisms that are effective These have ranged from school based to community based programs they have employed media driven efforts and they have used coordinated combinations of multiple approaches Reports have described both single session and multi session interventions with some research designs extending out over several years 7 8 9 10 Some innovative strategies engage students in one on one interactions 11 while others expose students to tobacco prevention theater productions 12 Obviously the more involved the program the more costly it becomes and the greater the requirements are for logistical coordination These more extensive programs also require a greater time investment and sustained commitment on the part of participants schools communities and researchers This present study describes a quantitative evaluation of the Tar Wars tobacco use prevention program delivered to a cohort of fifth grade students in western New York State Focus is directed at baseline measures of tobacco related knowledge attitudes beliefs and behaviors of the students and subsequent changes that occur after this brief intervention Methods Design Tobacco related knowledge attitudes beliefs and behaviors among a cohort of fifth grade elementary school students was examined in a longitudinal fashion through use of a pre test and two stage post test design The Tar Wars program offered by the American Academy of Family Physicians was used as the structured tobacco use prevention program e g intervention program This program is designed as a single interactive 40 50 minute in class presentation where students are provided with a series of dynamic exercises The children actively learn about the short term effects of tobacco use they contemplate and discuss reasons why people use tobacco products and they are prompted to think critically about tobacco advertising The program is often delivered by a Family Physician or other health care professional 9 13 The Tar Wars program content is highlighted in table 1and a printed curriculum is available at no charge http www tarwars org In brief the students discuss tobacco prevalence data the short term effects of tobacco including smelly clothes yellow teeth bad breath coughing or hacking and difficulty breathing Additionally they learn to calculate the costs involved with weekly monthly and yearly tobacco use as well as possible alternative ways to spend their money They also have an interactive discussion about the reasons people start to use tobacco which focuses on awareness of media advertising images and peer pressure that they are exposed to Finally through the use of tobacco advertisements they review misperceptions generated in the public at large and children in particular related to tobacco use including that smoking is related to obtaining romance having good looks attaining a cool image and making friends The program is reinforced through the creation of individual posters emphasizing the positive effects of remaining tobacco free Comparisons of tobacco use knowledge attitudes beliefs and behaviors of fifth grade students are made within a randomly assigned at the level of the school primary intervention group study Group 1 across three points in time pre test immediate post test and delayed post test Responses were also compared among children in other randomly assigned groups Group 2 and Group 3 who took pre tests the intervention and immediate post tests but at different points in time than Group 1 see Figure 1 Although Groups 2 and 3 can not be considered true control groups since they also received the educational intervention they are used in this paper in certain situations in an attempt to address issues of test retest bias since only one measurement instrument is used for both the pre test and the post test surveys and historical effects since other factors besides the intervention may have influenced the outcomes of the delayed post test Subjects Following Institutional Review Board approval 28 elementary schools were recruited to participate in the study Fifth grade students from 27 of these schools explanation below participated in the research described in this paper The study design and group comparisons are summarized in Figure 1 Twenty eight schools were initially separated into Group A and Group B using a randomized block design by school size in order to achieve roughly equal sized groups Group A which contained 16 schools was subsequently separated into two groups by random assignment with each group containing 8 schools Group B contained 12 schools The first group of 8 schools N 656 will be referred to as Group 1 the second group of 8 schools N 471 will be referred to as Group 2 and the group of 12 schools N 1120 will be referred to as Group 3 In the Fall of 1998 Group 1 started with 8 schools N 656 Seven of these schools were public and 1 was private while 6 were in an urban setting and 2 from a suburban setting All of these students were scheduled to take a baseline pre test however one school private urban could not schedule the time for the intervention and thus did not participate further in this research effort The difference between 656 and 578 students represents the missing school and anyone who was absent at the other 7 schools on the day of the post test completion Thus 7 of the 8 schools 88 N 578 completed the baseline pre test and the intervention The immediate post test was completed by 479 82 of the 578 students with baseline data During the Spring of 1999 after a delay of approximately four months the schools in Group 1 were contacted again so that they could complete a follow up delayed post test Two more schools were unable to schedule this follow up survey The difference between 489 and 371 students represents the two missing schools and anyone who was absent when the delayed post test was administered Thus a total of 5 63 out of 8 schools note N 371 or 54 of the students in the original 8 school cohort in Group 1 completed delayed post test evaluations These five schools in Group 1 of which all were public and 3 of which were in an urban setting and 2 from a suburban setting ended up completing all study components i e pre test intervention post test and delayed post test and represent the primary group for analyses Group 2 also started with 8 schools N 471 of which 7 were public and 1 was private and 6 of which were in an urban setting and 2 from a suburban setting All of these students completed the same baseline pre test during the Fall of 1998 This Group was then scheduled for the intervention during the early Spring of 1999 about 4 months later and to complete an evaluation post test immediately following the intervention Five of the eight schools were able to schedule the intervention and the immediate post test during this time The difference between 471 and 247 students represents the missing three schools and anyone who was absent on the day that the immediate post test was administered Thus a total of 5 63 out of 8 schools note N 247 or 52 of the students in the original 8 school cohort in Group 2 completed all requested components of which 4 schools were public and 1 private and 3 of which were in an urban setting and 2 from a suburban setting The 12 schools in Group 3 N 1120 of which 11 were public and 1 was private and 5 of which were in an urban setting and 7 from a suburban setting completed a baseline pre test during the Spring of 1999 This Group was then scheduled for the intervention and the immediate post test approximately 1 2 months later Three of the twelve schools were unable to schedule the intervention and the immediate post test during this time Thus a total of 9 75 out of 12 schools note N 783 or 61 of the students in the original 12 school cohort in Group 3 of which 8 were public and 1 private and 3 of which were in an urban setting and 6 from a suburban setting ended up completing all requested components For this study the participation of both students and schools was voluntary No exclusionary criteria were employed for any of the groups Analyses Proportions of correct responses to survey items were compared at the school level using Wilcoxon Matched Pairs Signed Ranks Tests for analyses of data from Group 1 schools baseline immediate post test and delayed post tests and for analyses of aggregate data from the 19 schools completing baseline surveys the intervention and immediate post tests P values were identified as significant if they were less than or equal to 05 thus rejecting the null hypothesis of no change from baseline following the intervention To examine whether significant differences were present between groups at the time of completion of the baseline survey the proportion of correct responses were compared at the group level aggregated schools for each group using the Mann Whitney Wilcoxon Rank Sums Test unpaired independent groups P values were identified as significant if they were less than or equal to 025 05 halved for a 2 tailed hypothesis thus rejected the null hypothesis that the proportions were not significantly different from each other Due to skewed data for the proportion of correct responses to each survey items at the level of both school and group median values are presented in the tables and non parametric procedures were used as described above Results Responses to the baseline survey for knowledge and attitude items among all schools were compared across all combinations of groups 1 versus 2 1 versus 3 and 2 versus 3 No significant differences were noted suggesting that randomization created comparable groups Also in looking at the comparison of Groups 1 and 3 at baseline we are able to rule out historical effects that is the presence of any systematic tobacco programs or policies that might have impacted our dependent variables In other words there were no significant differences in baseline measures even though the surveys were administered four months apart Moreover these results did not change after the loss of schools from each group indicating that the final 19 schools were comparable within and across groups to the original 27 schools excluding one school from Group 1 which dropped out prior to the baseline survey Table 2presents longitudinal results for the five schools in Group 1 which completed all study components baseline surveys intervention immediate post tests and delayed post tests Baseline median scores for correct responses to survey items range from 73 up to 98 with several values in the mid eighties and above suggesting a ceiling effect Nonetheless following the educational intervention program significant improvements are noted on both the immediate post test and delayed post tests for items relating to recognition that smokers have yellow teeth and fingers and costs associated with tobacco use Knowledge of tobacco use prevalence for these five Group 1 schools is shown in table 3 The median percent scores for correct responses at baseline are much lower for all three items ranging from 5 to 30 A significant increase from 5 at baseline to 34 correct on the immediate post test is noted for the item examining the percent of adults who use tobacco on a regular basis however the delayed post test scores fall back to baseline levels 12 No other significant findings are apparent for this group of items Table 4and 5present pooled aggregate data for students from all 19 schools 5 schools from Group 1 5 schools from Group 2 and 9 schools from Group 3 that completed baseline surveys the intervention and immediate post tests Although baseline median scores for the pooled data in table 4generally range between 86 and 98 significant increases are noted for all items relating to knowledge of the short term effects of tobacco use and half of the items examining attitudes about tobacco use e g the influence of peer pressure and the awareness of advertising images distortions All of the median scores of the items related to epidemiological knowledge of tobacco use table 5 showed significant increases between baseline and immediate post tests although post test values were sub optimal in that a number of students still were not reporting correct responses Discussion These results identified immediate and sustained improvements for 2 of 10 knowledge and attitude based survey items on tobacco use following exposure to an single session in class youth tobacco education program These two items related to the powerful image of tobacco users having yellow teeth and fingers and the costs associated with tobacco use These findings hold important public health significance First unlike other programs that require multiple sessions and considerable coordination Tar Wars is a single session structured interactive intervention program These results suggest the presence of modest and sustained responses as a result of this single session It is possible that these key concepts could be reinforced and even expanded through repeated exposures to and participation in other complementary tobacco prevention and health programs Thus Tar Wars can contribute as one element among a variety of educational strategies In addition the ultimate success of these educational programs requires the implementation of a comprehensive tobacco control strategy including legislation taxation and modification of social norms A number of potential limitations warrant discussion First in assessing post intervention changes in knowledge and attitudes the potential of a ceiling effect among variables with a high level of correct responses at baseline can complicate interpretation Statistical significance was not achieved for all items showing an increment in correct responses which may be due in part to a limited number of schools and the choice to complete analyses at the level of the school The inclusion of additional schools in the analysis would have resulted in significance for additional items Because student identities were anonymous a repeated measures design could not be used Also the school groups sampled at the delayed post test may not contain the same students who completed the pre test intervention and immediate post test during the Fall of 1998 Also there was some non systematic loss of schools in each group that were unable to complete all requested components due to scheduling difficulties and competing demands for classroom time However the observed response rates were reasonable given the follow up interval of several months Further these analyses relied upon non parametric tests at the level of the school As a result the median scores for some of individual schools are variable making the ordering inconsistent over testing occasions which in turn results in the extreme p values from the Wilcoxon tests Another potential limitation relates to test re test bias Theoretically the delay of several months between completion of the baseline survey and the intervention and immediate post test in Group 2 could be used to examine the potential issue of test re test bias In using the same survey instrument for the baseline and post tests we would tend to show an impact from the intervention where there might not be one However delaying the intervention and post test should create a less pronounced test re test bias if it exists In other words we would expect to see a greater increase on the immediate post test in Group 1 However a sub analysis demonstrated no significant differences between Groups 1 and 2 at baseline or on the immediate post test for any of the ten knowledge and attitude items Thus the issue of test re test bias does not seem to be a significant issue Also through the comparison of baseline surveys for Groups 1 and 3 we were able to rule out historical effects that is the presence of any systematic tobacco programs or policies that might have impacted our dependent variables of knowledge and attitude Moreover these results did not change after the exclusion of schools that failed to complete all components indicating that the final 19 schools were comparable with and across groups to the original 27 schools excluding one school from Group 1 which dropped out prior to the baseline survey Knowledge levels regarding tobacco use prevalence among selected age groups jumps at the immediate post test but drops back to baseline levels at the time of the delayed post test 4 months later These results in combination with the aggregate data comparing baseline and immediate post tests suggest that Tar Wars is having a positive impact on these children However virtually all program components would need to be reinforced through repetition and recall efforts at some identified interval The active learning model of Tar Wars which includes interactive demonstrations and classroom group discussions helps create the dynamics for long term retention This study design assessed changes in health beliefs e g knowledge and attitudes rather than actual behavior An assessment of changes in tobacco use behaviors would require a much longer period of follow up Also health behaviors represent the manifestation of interactions between attitudes knowledge and beliefs occurring within an environmental context Thus changes in attitudes and knowledge are likely to yield corresponding shifts in behavior Another potential limitation is that some students were lost to follow up due to competing demands for classroom time The most effective educational programs are structured to include a social influence intervention 6 14 Moreover associations between cigarette smoking and social norms peer influences and perceived tobacco use prevalence have been reported among a group of middle school students 6 th 8 thgrades 15 The social influences model includes dimensions reflecting both normative beliefs e g pressures to achieve peer acceptance and informational influences e g advertising 10 to enhance awareness of potential health effects and prevent adoption of unhealthy behaviors The Tar Wars tobacco prevention curriculum includes elements from both of these social influence dimensions with discussions of tobacco use prevalence physical consequences costs and misrepresentations used in advertising Together the Tar Wars themes emphasize an enhanced recognition of social pressures used to influence initiation of tobacco use A recent study 16 has reported no effects from application of a careful constructed social influences model for a school based tobacco prevention program from grades 3 through 12 These findings were generally unanticipated and have resulted in on going deliberation about how to assess the impact of youth prevention programs 3 While the findings from Peterson et al 2000 are disturbing it would seem foolhardy to simply abandon all school based tobacco prevention programs Conclusions Only a limited number of tobacco prevention materials for elementary school children are available from non profit sources 17 However the tobacco use prevention program presented in this study e g Tar Wars appears readily transferable to other community based settings This educational program is available for presentation by Family Physicians other health professionals or by other group leaders at no charge and yielded measurable improvements in tobacco use knowledge and attitude based survey items This tobacco use prevention program is also consistent with guidelines by the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control 18 which recommend inclusion of content which addresses the short term effects of tobacco use social influences of tobacco use marketing of tobacco products initiation of educational programs in elementary school and soliciting community support Moreover Tar Wars appears to meet criteria established for the programs that work process developed by the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control for selecting tobacco use prevention curricula http www cdc gov nccdphp dash rtc criteria htm It is important to acknowledge that youth are exposed to a variety of sources advocating tobacco free lifestyles As with other educational and motivational efforts in public health tobacco prevention messages require repetition and reinforcement via slightly different but parallel approaches These exposures to parallel messages likely reinforce or boost the educational impact Other educational interventions reinforcing the Tar War message of healthful tobacco free lifestyles include school health classes science classes alternative tobacco use prevention education programs and community religious youth groups Tobacco prevention programs represent interventions designed to increase awareness of the social influences facing youth In isolation any single prevention program is probably inadequate to induce behavioral change However together complementary messages may result in positive behavior changes through reinforcement of comparable information Overall we are looking at modest effects resulting from this single intervention However Tar Wars and other complementary program should be viewed as interlocking pieces of a puzzle not independent processes Also within the field of public health one of the most important insights is the understanding of Rose s theorem whereby if a large number of people in this case schoolchildren are exposed to an intervention and change only a lit bit for the better then the population health ramifications can be quite dramatic Certainly the results from this study suggest that a logistically uncomplicated and low cost program such as Tar Wars should be included within the educational armamentarium to aid in preventing youth from using tobacco products Competing interests Dr Mahoney previously served as a former member and Chair of the Tar Wars Advisory Board American Academy of
