 okay uh let s see i i believe in the trial by jury i think if it was up to the judge alone that there would be real possible for uh payoffs you know briberies uh unfairness one sidedness you know all those kinds of things and i i also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent absolutely sure before you convict somebody i really i really agree with the uh innocent until proven guilty theory i think that s that s a good way to do it you know that s about all well i think i think basically we re in a lot of agreement uh in that i certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs uh some kind of legal definition um hum but for anything involving that a trial by jury certainly should be mandatory um hum but there should be uh with our overworked uh judicial system it seems to me like there ought to be a means of of um not having to take everything before a full court you know maybe there ought to be some kind of of uh as as as an example where called a jury duty now um hum really and and maybe instead of of uh just kind of blowing it off and just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do um hum maybe we should commit to spend a week and during that week you re kind of an ad hoc let s hear about it group of i don t know twenty five instead of twelve um hum and each each case is presented to that group of of twenty five and those cases are of lesser degrees of magnitude you know the guy was caught burgling uh and he had his pockets full of stuff you know when he was caught uh you know that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say you know your pleasure your honor right and there s not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing but the way our system our court system works that guy s going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time yeah right uh i just think our system is overworked and we re starting to stress the true meaning of of right to a speedy trial yeah that s that s a good idea maybe this pre group of people could decide you know which kind of uh you know where they could go from there do they need a big lengthy uh twelve person jury jury or do they need a six person jury or you know those kinds of things and the degree of the of the you know the seriousness of it you know how is this open and shut you know like you were saying or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try to figure out what really happened you know a jury like that you know we yeah that s uh that could be a good idea to uh that could work you know kind of deltaing off what what we ve been talking about here uh i believe that um hum our we ve we ve become almost litigious uh society where we re everyone everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff and although we re supporting a whole segment of society called lawyers maybe we don t need to do that yeah uh huh you know maybe instead of of being so quick to sue you uh if you have a disagreement with someone instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff maybe you need you and if you want to your lawyer or your your opponent need to go face this group of twenty five or a Judge Wapner like you know that they have on TV and let huh yeah yeah either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case and let s you know let s get rid of some of this harassment suing yeah right that right that s that s a good idea i in the Bible it says uh if you have something against somebody to go to them first and if that doesn t work then to go get somebody you know a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them and if that doesn t work to take it to the whole church so that s right off that same kind of principle you bet and if that s a that s a good idea if we could all deal with those kinds of beliefs we wouldn t have half the yeah that s true that s true too but uh you know that whole Biblical concept like that that s true in a lot of our um you know the the way the whole judicial system and the government is based on that it doesn t work on that but it s based out of that and uh so that you know that could work there yes i d forgotten what that s called there s a a real name for that like the Judean law or something like that um what is that called the Judo Christian ethic Judeo Christian ethic well that may be right it s in there some place i think we both know what that we re talking about the foundation of our legal society yeah right right right uh to and too the that was sort of the the beginning of ye shall be treated fairly um hum uh i guess the the Lord started out with we ll treat you fairly i ll treat you fairly there as long as you do what i say uh that s sort of the Old Testament version yeah that s i know i did a Sunday school lesson one time on the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament where where there s a vengeful Lord in the Old Testament and there s a loving Lord in the New Testament but that s a whole different subject really really really yeah okay well i i think we have exhausted my pitifully small knowledge on on the legal system mine too yeah mine too but it s been a pleasure talking with you yeah same here what what part of the country are you from i m living here in Texas oh okay in in Texas okay i was just being curious well that s quite all right okay yeah well i m i m from the Dallas area oh okay well that s that s neat well so am i in fact i m at work out at Lewisville oh are you really wow okay well i ll let you go and it was nice talking to you my pleasure have a good day bye bye oh you too bye
