 The Rules George Washington was virtuous but was virtuousness altogether a good thing This entirely reasonable question turns out to be extremely old Stendhal posed it in the 1830s in his novel Lucien Leuwen in which the wealthy young Parisian hero contemplates fleeing the corruptions of monarchical old France for a new start in virtuous republican America But would Stendhal s hero be able to stand the virtuous republicans He considers paying a visit on George Washington himself America s greatest man at home on his farm But would he find Washington s conversation bright and sparkling Washington would have bored me to death Stendhal s hero concludes American readers are aghast I would prefer by a hundred times the elegant manners of a corrupt heart Now comes the Library of America with a handsome new edition published on elegant paper with a lustrous black cover of the writings of Washington himself more than a thousand pages of letters and documents of every sort which allows us to judge for ourselves The book makes a strange impression The Library of America in its admirable effort to present America s literature and classic political documents in pristine form has adopted the rather extreme policy of publishing its volumes without any sort of introductory guide which is probably just as well in the case of literary authors whose work is easily approached Some authors require an introduction though political writers especially The Library of America produced a fat 1 500 page volume of Jefferson some years ago but Jefferson s writings turned out to be a shapeless heap of private letters and peculiar jottings intermixed with an occasional manifesto of immortal grandeur and to make your way through them unaided was nearly impossible Likewise with the new Washington volume Washington was not a book writer or any kind of writer at all professionally speaking but took quill in hand merely to address particular situations as they arose His Writings as a result offer a puzzling mass of personal letters military records presidential orations ringing statements and random insignificant scribblings all of them put into chronological order by the Library of America which is to say into very little order at all except that of chance Still the patriotic reader plunges in and instantly discovers in the volume s first entry a document of capital importance in re the insidious Gallically anti American accusation offered by Stendhal s novel The opening document dating from 1747 when Washington was 15 is a numbered catechism of dos and don ts called Rules of Civility Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation Whether this document belongs in a collection of Washington s writings seems a little dubious given that as the assiduous reader will discover with a glance at the note on page 1 094 by the volume s editor John Rhodehamel Washington did not actually write these Rules but merely copied them from an English translation of a French language Jesuit text from the 16 th century The Rules contain 110 numbered passages offering such worthy bits of advice as this from No 12 B edew no mans face with your Spittle by approaching too near him when you Speak or this from No 16 Do not Puff up the Cheeks Loll not out the tongue rub the Hands or beard thrust out the lips or bite them or keep the Lips too open or too Close No 90 says Being Set at meat Scratch not neither Spit Cough or blow your Nose except there s a Necessity for it And at once from the opening document of Washington s Writings the suspicion arises that the Father of Our Country was in truth a hideous Bore Alas But what makes the unhappy discovery truly appalling is the further incredible discovery that Washington s earnest and humorless Rules are considered by experts to be the key to his entire career and therefore in some respect a key to America s two centuries of national success Last year a conservative writer named Richard Brookhiser published a biography titled Founding Father Rediscovering George Washington which made the point that Washington by keeping in mind his carefully inscribed numbered Rules throughout his momentous life conducted himself correctly in all the Little Ways no bedewing of others with Spittle Hats properly Doffed and so forth which led to right conduct in the Big Ways too thus to political and military triumph Supremely convinced of this point Brookhiser has gone ahead and brought out his own little edition of Washington s rules under the title Rules of Civility The 110 Precepts That Guided Our First President in War and Peace slightly altered to eliminate the 18 th century idiosyncrasies a pity and emended with small commentaries by Brookhiser himself some of them pertaining to events in Washington s life others solemnly applying of Washington s rules to circumstances of today Yet even Brookhiser for all his sober devotion to civility as the key to everything cannot escape noticing something ridiculous therefore comic in Washington s rules And so bravely embracing what he cannot deny Brookhiser in his edition of the rules throws in some jocularity of his own with the sure lightness of touch you would expect from an author who has based his biography of Washington on a guide to etiquette Washington s Rule No 2 proclaims in the Library of America s superior 18 th century version When in Company put not your Hands to any Part of the Body not usually Discovered To which Brookhiser gruesomely adds in his own edition A rule often flouted by rap singers and pitchers Washington s Rule No 4 says In the Presence of Others Sing not to yourself with a humming Noise nor Drum with your Fingers or Feet To which Brookhiser adds Don t carry a boom box either And the embarrassments pile up one upon the other and the patriotic reader wilts in his chair and Washington ends up too ludicrous for words At least the Library of America s Writings contains an endless supply of additional material There are military entries full of wampum and warpaths during the French and Indian War and complaints to Congress during the Revolutionary War which are interesting to read even if Washington unlike Grant and Sherman from the Civil War was not much of a military writer There is a long amiable letter to the young Lafayette in 1779 in which Washington in a giddy mood drifts into a reverie about competing for Lafayette s young wife with Lafayette himself a funny bit of teasing followed abruptly by a rueful reassurance worthy of Stendhal himself that amidst all the wonders recorded in holy writ no instance can be produced where a Woman from real inclination has preferred an old man It is interesting to see how warm he grew toward Alexander Hamilton he signed his letters I am Your Affectionate and how awkward and self conscious toward Jefferson whose allies were berating Washington in such exaggerated and indecent terms as could scarcely be applied to a Nero a notorious defaulter or even to a common pick pocket Naturally the Library of America edition also contains hidden here and there in impossible to find locations a number of solemn and stirring documents of state for instance the reply genuinely dear to my own multiculturally American Jewish heart that Washington made as president to a letter from the Hebrew Congregation of Newport R I The congregation had written to congratulate him about something or other unspecified by the notes and Washington replied The Citizens of the United States of America have a right to applaud themselves for having given to mankind examples of an enlarged and liberal policy a policy worthy of imitation All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship It is now no more that toleration is spoken of as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights For happily the Government of the United States which gives to bigotry no sanction to persecution no assistance requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens in giving in on all occasions their effectual support May the children of the Stock of Abraham who dwell in this land continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other Inhabitants while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and figtree and there shall be none to make him afraid The letter is wonderfully gracious and yet the graciousness owes everything to Washington s feelings about republican revolution and nothing at all to what could be learned from a 16 th century Jesuit manual of courtly behavior
