                     Im being interviewed by Umar Rashid         I was born in NY but my ethnicity is Egyptian male and Im a student going to college and Umar wanted me to talk about stories of culture and childhood         Well my dad has told me about stories about when he came when he came just to go back and see Egypt for after coming back for so many years and even be before he left Egypt about the quote unquote hicks         Theyre not necessarily hicks theyre just people who really didnt know any better         A lot of farmers a lot of people who never experienced electricity um went to school and so they never knew things like the earth rotated         My uh dad was telling me a story about when he rode on the train this one time and he was sitting next to this guy who was all giddy and all excited and um he was telling my dad Do you think were moving         And my dad said Of course yeah         And the guy replied Well no were not moving see         The earth rotates and were just staying still         So that as the earth is rotating and were staying still were moving from one point to the other         And that was one of the examples he told of how much education was important when he tried to explain things to me         Things like that         It was not that it was his fault         It was just that he didnt know any better and that was how people were like in Egypt those poor people         And in Egypt there was no real middle class         You were either extremely poor or you were extremely wealthy         There was very little socalled middle class people         Then of course as time went on he started talking to me about dating         And of course you know dating was a cool thing if you were smart about it         When he was in Egypt early on in this time the peoples of the uh the parents of the their parents were really strict on you know should well boys and girls date         And the answer to a lot of those people was not a chance in hell         If you wanted to date a girl you would have had to take them outside the city because a lot of their parents their fathers or even their brothers may either kill you or beat you up or force you to marry her         Of course neither was a uh option         He just wanted to you know enjoy a good time with a woman not necessarily you know anything intimate but have a good conversation with a woman and that was heavily frowned upon in the Middle East         Another thing that happened would be told me about um was in Egypt you know stories of women cheating on their husbands         In the culture of Egypt if you were a Muslim when a uh if you were a woman and a girlfriend were to come over the man would even leave the room or even leave the house because if there wasnt a man accompanying her of course the man could not converse with her because of you know the temptation of whatever         And when this when a woman would come over it may or may not be a woman because this person has left the room         The uh my dad would tell me stories of people he knew who would uh dress up in womens clothing with the full you know coverings and walk in and uh have sex with these mens wives and walk out                     Do you remember anything specifically Joe                     Well he wouldnt give me any specific names because obviously I wouldnt know who these people were but uh he would tell me stories like that         He also told me stories about how men and women went to the movies                     Uhhuh                     They would go into separate doors         The men would drop off the women in there from their cars they would go and park and they would eventually walk together and of course the women would walk behind the man         Now when they were to go pick up you know at the end of the night the uh women would stand in the corner and the man would go get the cars         And the men really pretty much had no idea who their wives were because they were covered up                                                               Basically whoever opened the door that was their wife         and thats when they drove off         And uh it was kind of rather interesting         The differences in a culture in the Middle East         Of course women you know would have to walk behind the man         In the Muslim world not necessarily in the cultural world not necessarily a cultural not necessarily Christian                      Im sorry Joe         How old were you when you started hearing these stories                     Uh I dont know         I think it was about well the whole dating thing was around   so                      Do you remember any from when you were around six or seven                     Six or seven         Well that was the hick thing                     Oh OK OK         Sorry                              Yeah Im sorry Umar was not paying he had left the room so I could continue telling the story just so you guys dont know         Now he came back so hes a little out of touch         Um now were going to go onto education         And of course my dad was was very strict on education and education was very important for anybody in the Middle East and of course nowadays anybody in the United States         You had to know your education         You had to go to school         My dad told me a lot of times when he was a TA in college he had to proctor an exam         And a                     Sorry Joe         How old were you when you heard this                     Tst tst tst         Well          Yeah         And um he told me the story of this woman he would not let take this exam because he didnt know if the person taking that exam was that women         You know I mean because she would it was very unusual that she would cover up more than was usual         And he wasnt sure if that was the person taking the exam         And so there was a whole commotion about it         The uh professor had to come in and the professor had to get a female to come in have her take a look at her and check her ID because in Egypt women didnt have IDs         You couldnt just you know heres an idea of a woman with a face covering you know         That didnt really work in Egypt         And uh of course education was very important         He told me stories of the educational system in Egypt         How very different it was in Egypt as opposed to here         One test determines whether what college you got to what profession you go into         There are two exams that you will take in your life in your junior year of high school and then in your senior year         The junior year is pretty much a practice exam and its not based upon how well you do         Its based upon how well you do overall everybody else         And what percentile you get determines what college you can get into because college in Egypt is free         So uh last time I heard if you made a  or higher on a  point this  point exam you can go into an engineering school         But you couldnt go anything higher than that not doctorate         You had to make a  to go into a doctorate school         Now of course you can go below that if you want another profession but thats why education was very important in Egypt         Because what you know you had to do         In Egypt everyone competed against each other for the better grade so everyone studied on their own and um and definitely had different study practices and mental practices towards education in the Middle East         You know stuff the teacher was well respected in the Middle East as opposed to here         You know in the high school where they can pretty much considered the baby sitter         This was no joke         You could be asked to leave in Egypt if you were told to         And those are the stories about education women cheating dating and the quoteunquote hicks         Thank you         Have a good day
