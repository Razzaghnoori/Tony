 Background Mycobacteria are Gram positive acid fast pleomorphic non motile rods belonging to the order Actinomycetales Mycobacterium avium complex organisms consist of the human and animal pathogens M avium subsp avium M avium subsp paratuberculosis and M avium subsp silvaticum 1 DNA DNA hybridization studies have long ago established a genetic similarity between M avium subspecies avium M avium and M avium subspecies paratuberculosis M paratuberculosis 2 3 4 Now that whole genome sequencing technologies are available investigators can begin to examine genetic relatedness in greater detail through direct nucleotide nucleotide comparisons These comparisons are particularly important in instances where two genetically similar bacteria have little or no specific diagnostic tests to distinguish each The literature reports genetic similarity between M paratuberculosis and M avium at between 72 and 95 2 4 depending on the region analyzed However despite the reported similarities these mycobacteria are quite different phenotypically M paratuberculosis is an intracellular pathogen that infects ruminant animals most notably cattle and sheep The site of infection is the gastrointestinal tract where it causes a chronic inflammatory ailment termed Johne s disease 5 In contrast M avium is common in the environment causes tuberculosis in birds and disseminated infections in HIV patients 6 Growth of M paratuberculosis is characterized by its slow rate doubling time of 22 26 hours compared to 10 12 hours for M avium and requirement of mycobactin in culture media 5 With the absence of a well defined genetic system for M paratuberculosis a comparative genomic approach holds great potential in addressing the genetic basis for many of these phenotypic differences The genus Mycobacterium contains species that range from fast growingsaprophytes such as M smegmatis and M fortuitum to slow growing pathogens such as M leprae M tuberculosis and M paratuberculosis Although the chromosomal origin of replication has been studied in some mycobacteria 7 8 the genetic organization of the origin of replication in M paratuberculosis has been previously unknown Knowledge of the gene organization and sequence of this region is particularly important because chromosomal replication may be regulated by a common mechanism that could directly affect rate of growth Several features of the oriC region are highly conserved among bacteria The sequence immediately flanking the dnaA gene is considered the origin of chromosomal replication or oriC region 9 10 This region contains several genes that encode proteins required for basic cellular functions including the protein subunit of RNase P RnpA ribosomal protein L34 RpmH the replication initiator protein DnaA the beta subunit of DNA polymerase III DnaN the recombination repair protein RecF and the DNA gyrase proteins GyrA and GyrB The relative gene order in this region is also highly conserved in many bacteria especially the Gram positives 11 Although intergenic sequences in this region are conserved only among closely related organisms the DnaA box is found in the non coding regions flanking dnaA in most bacteria studied 12 DnaA boxes are conserved nucleotide sequences TTGTCCACA where the DnaA protein binds to DNA triggering events that ultimately lead to replication initiation and DNA synthesis 9 In an effort to understand the genetic basis for growth rate and other phenotypic differences between M paratuberculosis and M avium we have analyzed the genetic similarity of these genomes using two strategies First the putative oriC region of M paratuberculosis was amplified sequenced and compared with M avium and other bacteria Second we examined nucleotide identity outside the oriC region using DNA homology matrix analysis as well as using several hundred M paratuberculosis sequences from a random shotgun library compared with M avium sequences present in the unfinished microbial genomes database Our results show that these subspecies not only have a conserved gene order surrounding the origin of chromosomal replication but also have a high synteny and nucleotide identity throughout both genomes In addition this preliminary comparative survey of the genomes of M avium and M paratuberculosis show even greater similarity 97 than the literature suggests 72 to 95 2 Results Identification of predicted ORFs encoding replication related proteins An 11 kb contiguous genomic fragment from M paratuberculosis was amplified and sequenced using 15 primer pairs designed from M avium genomic sequence in the putative oriC region Fig 1 This strategy enabled the successful amplification of all 15 minimally overlapping fragments of 800 bp in length for this region of the M paratuberculosis chromosome A putative replication origin was identified by GC skew analysis 14 A strong inflection point in the GC plot marks this origin Fig 1 Eleven ORFs were identified using the gene prediction software Artemis 15 release 3 The Sanger Centre http www sanger ac uk Software Artemis Similarity searches were conducted locally using the BLASTP algorithm through the Artemis interface Seven of these ORFs have high identity to proteins essential for basic cellular processes including replication in other mycobacterial species Table 1 The function of GidB is unknown but it may have a role in cell division 11 RNase P which consists of the protein subunit RnpA and a catalytic RNA subunit is essential for generating mature tRNAs by cleaving the 5 terminal leader sequences of precursor tRNAs 16 rpmH encodes ribosomal protein L34 and DnaA is the initiator protein for chromosome replication The B subunit of DNA polymerase is encoded by dnaN The recF gene product is involved in recombination DNA repair and induction of the SOS response and may also have a role in replication 17 Bacterial DNA gyrase a tetramer consisting of A and B subunits catalyzes the ATP dependent unwinding of covalently closed circular DNA 18 The remaining predicted ORFs in this region have high similarity to hypothetical proteins from M tuberculosis Table 1 Sequence homology and conserved gene order in the oriCregion of mycobacteria and other gram positive bacteria Alignment of the region surrounding oriC for several mycobacteria and other gram positive bacteria provides some interesting comparisons Fig 2 The M paratuberculosis oriC region conforms to the conserved gene order that is present in other mycobacteria as well as the closely related Streptomyces coelicolor Even the more distantly related Bacillus subtilis shows some degree of synteny in this region The fast growing M smegmatis species contains a gnd sequence between dnaN and recF which is absent in the slow growing mycobacteria Fig 2 However there appear to be no notable differences between M avium and M paratuberculosis at this level The M smegmatis coding sequence gnd has similarity to the 6 phophogluconate dehydrogenase genes in E coli but the mycobacterial protein is predicted to be about 200 amino acids shorter than the E coli homolog The length of non coding intergenic regions between rpmH dnaA and dnaA dnaN is well conserved among the bacteria shown in figure 2 In many bacteria where a functional oriC has been identified this gene order is conserved and oriC is adjacent to the dnaA gene 9 10 19 The amino acid sequence of each gene product was compared with the corresponding sequence in M paratuberculosis for all species in this study Table 2 The data show that while gene order is conserved the percent identity declines in comparisons with mycobacteria other than M avium This percent identity declines even further in comparisons with non mycobacterial sequences such as S coelicolor and Corynebacteria glutamicum Table 2 Conserved functional motifs in the M paratuberculosisputative oriC Fuzznuc EMBOSS http www hgmp mrc ac uk Software EMBOSS index html was used to identify potential DnaA boxes in the M paratuberculosis oriC region The Gram positive organisms in this study harbor 10 30 DnaA boxes with 1 3 mismatches from the consensus sequence TTGTCCACA flanking the dnaA sequence 8 20 21 22 23 and 35 were found surrounding the M paratuberculosis dnaA gene Fig 3 In addition a hexameric sequence thought to be recognized by ATP DnaA AGATCT was found in the 3 non coding sequence adjacent to dnaA Fig 3b The significance of additional dnaA boxes in M paratuberculosis is likely necessary to open the DNA helix of this GC rich organism 69 GC content The dnaA gene is divided into four functional domains based on analysis of several dnaA mutants 24 These domains consist of 1 an area near the N terminus thought be involved in ability of the DnaA protein to aggregate 2 ATP binding 3 a domain that maps to a region near the C terminus and is involved in DNA binding 4 and a final domain of unknown function but may bind DnaB The conserved ATP binding site that is found in domain III in other bacteria was also located in M paratuberculosis Fig 3b An AT rich stretch of 19 nucleotides 74 A T which in other bacteria serves as the site of local unwinding of DNA after DnaA DNA interaction was located in non coding sequence adjacent to dnaA Fig 3b The non coding sequences flanking dnaA are slightly AT rich in general relative to the rest of the genome sequence consistent with findings in other gram positive bacteria 38 40 A T vs 33 in the entire sequence A vast majority of all M paratuberculosisK 10 genomic sequence have considerable nucleotide similarity to sequences from the human pathogenic isolate M avium104 As a basis for all nucleotide comparisons between M avium and M paratuberculosis in this study an alignment of the 16s rRNA gene was performed That analysis revealed a 100 nucleotide identity over the entire 1 472 bp gene data not shown Likewise the oriC region in M paratuberculosis was found to share a high level of nucleotide identity 98 with M avium Calculation of the rates of total nucleotide diversity 3 and synonymous substitution per synonymous site ds and non synonymous substitution per non synonymous site dn revealed patterns of variation within the range observed from sequence data outside the oriC region These calculations showed a high degree of similarity between the two sequences and a predominance of synonymous over non synonymous substitutions Fig 1 The patterns of nucleotide substitution varied considerably between genes in this region of the genome For instance there was complete nucleotide identity in the rpmH and recF genes and only 94 identity in the gene rnpA To verify that these observed differences were real and not as a result of sequencing errors in the yet unfinished M avium genome we confirmed the data by resequencing the entire 11 kb region from an isolate clone of M avium and obtained identical results not shown We next determined if the nucleotide identities would remain consistently high when M paratuberculosis sequences outside the oriC region were compared with M avium Sequencing of the M paratuberculosis K 10 cattle isolate is nearing completion in our laboratories and TIGR http www tigr orgis in the finishing stages of M avium isolate 104 Beginning with nucleotide number 1 in the dnaA coding region of each genome a comparison of 2 million bases of M paratuberculosis with 2 million bases from M avium by Pustell DNA matrix analysis 25 indicates that genomic similarity continues outside the surrounding oriC region Fig 4 When evaluating similarities between two sequences of this size a matrix comparison is the method of first choice In addition the matrix method displays matching regions in the context of the sequence as a whole making it easy to determine if the regions are repeated or inverted For example figure 4shows a large 56 6 kb genomic inversion of the region surrounding nucleotide 350 000 The DNA identity matrix also identified sequences that were present in one genome but absent in the other as shown by the broken diagonal lines Fig 4 These data show remarkable similarity over large regions in both mycobacterial genomes Finally we analyzed 548 recombinant clones from a randomly sheared M paratuberculosis small insert library in order to obtain specific rates of nucleotide substitutions Sequences from these clones represented over 350 000 bp of unique non overlapping M paratuberculosis genomic DNA and comprised 7 of the estimated 5 Mb genome sequence From this analysis we estimated the rates of total synonymous and non synonymous substitutions for 200 fragments that were aligned in frame and then analyzed with the program NAGV2 26 using the methods of Nei and Gojobori 27 The results of these analyses show that the average nucleotide diversity between the two species is 2 59 0 06 range 0 to 18 8 median 1 85 0 05 The results also show that the average rates of synonymous substitution per synonymous site are 3 38 1 32 range 0 to 19 5 median 3 5 1 5 In contrast the rates of non synonymous substitution per non synonymous site were 1 89 0 05 range 0 to 12 9 median 1 3 0 05 These results not only indicate that the two subspecies have a high degree of nucleotide identity 97 but also suggest that the patterns of substitution have favored synonymous substitutions as can be expected from positive selection Discussion With the genome sequencing projects of M paratuberculosis and M avium nearing completion we have been able to compare large amounts of sequence data for the first time Our results show substantial nucleotide identity above even that reported previously in the literature 2 3 4 Paradoxically the overall nucleotide identity between these phenotypically distinct mycobacteria appears similar to that observed with two phenotypically identical Helicobacter pylori isolates at 98 nucleotide identity 28 The high nucleotide identity shared between M paratuberculosis and M avium directly conflicts with their divergent phenotypic characteristics Because of strong similarity in the oriC region alternative hypotheses should be tested to explain the growth rate differences between M avium and M paratuberculosis Genomic rearrangements and the presence of unique genes identified by matrix analysis in this study are two such possibilities that could account for some of the phenotypic differences We have recently reported on M paratuberculosis coding sequences that are absent in M avium 29 From an analysis of 48 of the M paratuberculosis genome only 27 predicted coding sequences were found to be absent in M avium Therefore an estimated total of 50 60 M paratuberculosis coding sequences might be absent in M avium following a whole genome analysis This extremely low number of unique M paratuberculosis genes is in stark contrast to E coli where the MG1655 isolate contains 528 genes not found in the EDL933 isolate 30 Further analysis of this limited number of unique coding sequences will be critical in developing specific diagnostic reagents Finally a detailed analysis of coding sequences unique to each respective mycobacterial genome and their genetic regulatory networks will be necessary to understand the molecular basis for growth rate and other phenotypic differences Other potential explanations include the presence of global regulators insertion sequences transcription translation rates genomic rearrangements and ribosomal RNA operons Each respective genome possesses insertion elements IS900 IS1311 at unique loci that could distinctly affect growth difference or other phenotype by insertional mutation Foley Thomas et al 31 compared the expression of the luciferase gene in M paratuberculosis with the fast growing M smegmatis and concluded that the rates of transcription and translation may not account for the slow growth of M paratuberculosis We present evidence for at least one large scale genomic rearrangement between these two subspecies This rearrangement consists of a 56 6 kb inversion that contains approximately 61 predicted coding sequences Bannantine and Kapur unpublished Genomic rearrangements such as that described could have a profound effect on phenotype The presence of multiple copies of ribosomal RNA operons within a genome can be directly attributed to faster growth rate The increased gene dosage results in more ribosomes and therefore increased protein translational capacity However only one rRNA operon is present in each subspecies and this is also true for the fast growers Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium chelonae 32 These fast growing mycobacteria have multiple promoters that increase the transcriptional rate of the rRNA operon to overcome gene dosage limitations 32 The rRNA operon promoter structures have not been mapped by primer extension for either M paratuberculosis or M avium but if M avium had multiple functional rRNA operon promoters that may account for the growth rate differences The genetic organization of the origin of replication has been characterized in several Gram positive pathogens including B subtilis S coelicolor M tuberculosis M avium M leprae and M smegmatis 8 The results of our investigation on the oriC region of M paratuberculosis show that each of the 15 primer pairs designed from M avium sequence data resulted in the successful amplification and subsequent sequencing of an 11 kb region of the M paratuberculosis genome The sequenced region encodes 11 putative proteins several of which show a high level of identity to proteins that are known or predicted to be involved in DNA replication However we found a cluster of substitutions in a region of rnpA data not shown It is noteworthy that in this region of the gene each of the nucleotide substitutions results in an amino acid replacement While mutations in this region of the gene are known to result in dramatic differences in ability of bacteria to respond to environmental stresses 33 the functional significance of these differences between M avium and M paratuberculosis are at present unknown While these sequencing efforts have revealed a conserved gene order in the oriC of Gram positive bacteria 11 the nucleotide and amino acid identity between M paratuberculosis and M avium in this region is much stronger when compared to other mycobacteria and other Gram positive bacteria see Table 2 It is well recognized that the characterization of gene organization in the oriC region as well as the complete genome sequence will provide a springboard for addressing questions such as the nature of the slow growth rate of M paratuberculosis as compared to the genetically related rapidly growing mycobacteria Progress on these research fronts will improve our chances of understanding and controlling infections caused by M paratuberculosis and related pathogens The conservation of functional sequence motifs in the oriC of other Gram positive organisms has provided clues to the mechanism of bacterial replication For instance DnaA monomers bind to specific non palindromic 9 nucleotide sequences called DnaA boxes and this interaction is thought to initiate replication The oriC of Gram positive bacteria typically contains 10 30 of these DnaA boxes often found in non coding regions flanking the dnaA gene The interaction of DnaA with DnaA boxes promotes the local unwinding of a nearby AT rich region providing an entry site for the DnaB DnaC helicase complex The dnaA gene itself is divided into four domains that differ in the extent of sequence homology 34 Domain IV is responsible for DnaA box recognition and domain III is a highly conserved region containing the ATP binding site 13 35 Domain I participates in cooperative DnaA protein DNA interactions 36 The genetic relatedness of M paratuberculosis with other mycobacterial subspecies has been the root cause of the lack of development of M paratuberculosis specific diagnostic tests By comparing the genome sequences of both M paratuberculosis and M avium specific diagnostic tests may be developed and a better understanding of the molecular differences that contribute to unique phenotypes will be obtained Finally knowledge of the complete genome sequence of M paratuberculosis is expected to facilitate the identification of diagnostic sequences in this economically significant veterinary pathogen Conclusion With the genomes of M paratuberculosis and M avium nearly completed investigators will be able to analyze the similarities and differences between these genomes with amazing detail Through a comparative genomic analysis of over 2 million nucleotides we have shown that the two subspecies avium and paratuberculosis are highly similar at the gene and nucleotide level This is in stark contrast to the phenotypic differences that each displays Methods Strains and growth media A cattle isolate K 10 of M paratuberculosis 31 has been chosen for genome sequencing studies The organism was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth supplemented with OADC Difco Laboratories Detroit MI Tween 80 and mycobactin J Allied Monitor Fayette MO as described by
