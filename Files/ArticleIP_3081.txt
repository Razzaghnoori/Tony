 Piano Forte The tell us a lot about this recording First a superbly voiced E flat major chord with every instrument audible the winds biting through the string sound the timpani crisp yet viscerally forceful Then the soloist begins his famous heroic surge up the keyboard Except that he doesn t sound heroic he sounds tinkly His finger work is impeccable his phrasing elegant his stance as swaggering as one could wish but the sound of his instrument a fortepiano an earlier less powerful version of our modern day piano is irreconcilably at odds with his intentions The original instrument movement is several decades old and has moved so far beyond mere novelty that in some repertoires it might even be considered the new orthodoxy Bach performance in the style of those old Grand Teutons conductors like Furtw ngler Klemperer and von Karajan has fallen out of fashion and favor and massed Victorian armies raising the rafters as they belt out The Messiah now seem quaintly anachronistic In music of the 19 th century though the use of original instruments is still controversial Do they reveal the composer s intentions or merely demonstrate the practical limitations against which he struggled Keyboard music poses the question in its starkest terms Was the 19 th century concert grand developed in response to the music being composed by Beethoven and his contemporaries in order to realize its potential more fully or was the Romantic style of keyboard writing itself a response to the sound of these new instruments These aren t idle questions When Beethoven was sent a Broadwood grand as a gift from its British manufacturer in 1818 he maneuvered to avoid paying import duties incidentally he was delighted with both the gift and the instrument It s not unreasonable to assume that he considered it a superior medium for the performance of his music even music composed before he received the gift Robert Levin the fortepiano soloist on this recording and a respected musical scholar assumes otherwise As he makes his way through the cycle of Beethoven concertos he plans to use different instruments for the different pieces determining the compass of each instrument he employs by the range of notes each piece demands He believes as he put it in a conversation with me recently that no matter the size of the room Beethoven always insists on banging his head on the ceiling and stubbing his toe on the floor This is elegantly put and close to inarguable If Beethoven had a five and a half octave instrument at his disposal the music he wrote for it probably would demand the highest and the lowest notes of that five and a half octave span But does it necessarily follow that the instrument available to him on any given occasion produced the ideal sound he heard in his head This question is more pointed for the Emperor concerto than it might be for its predecessors Although not the first grandly heroic piano concerto Mozart s K 503 arguably merits that description the Emperor proclaimed its grandeur in an especially aggressive way and in so doing became the model for concertos of the Romantic era The drama inherent in concerto performance valiant soloist vying with and defying the mass of the orchestra with his eloquence and virtuosity is the very essence of the Emperor One would think it requires an instrument that can challenge the orchestra in volume and power To play the piece on a fortepiano seems almost perverse That said it must also be said that no other performance could have offered a better opportunity to decide whether Levin is right Gardiner s conducting is so good his Beethoven Symphony cycle is to my ears the one to own and his Mozart and Handel performances are exemplary Levin s playing is so dexterous intelligent and ardent and the recording is so technically splendid there are felicities of scoring such as a solo cello line in the first movement I d never noticed before that whatever its peculiarities this release at least qualifies as best of breed And how does it fare In the lyrical sections it works superbly most of the second movement say and the beautiful B minor C flat major section of the first movement s second subject projected with supple delicacy by Levin In the filigree figures accompanying transitional passages in the first movement or the dialogue with the French horns near the end of the same movement it s close to a revelation This I found myself thinking must be the precise blend Beethoven intended But in the heroic passages that define the work it doesn t succeed for me at all The cadenza that opens the concerto sounds wan and unassertive its even more extravagant recapitulation tries harder while achieving less The great four against three contrary motion chromatic scales one of the most thrilling virtuoso passages in the literature are bland in spite of Levin s awesome execution And in the battle of block chords toward the end of the development section the piano comes off as strident rather than imperial as it attempts to rival the orchestra This performance contains one other oddity worth noting Levin accompanies the orchestra continuo style during the tutti sections passages when the soloist is normally silent This is a controversial practice even in Mozart concertos and unheard of in 19 th century works In his liner notes and more elaborately in our conversation Levin claims the manuscript score makes Beethoven s intentions unambiguous on this point His argument is persuasive but the conclusion is so counterintuitive why should the soloist meekly accompany the orchestra when he isn t defying it that I remain unconvinced His contributions in these passages are largely unobtrusive and in a medium without a visual component not especially bothersome but the choice nevertheless seems eccentric The other piece on the recording the Fantasy for Pianoforte Chorus and Orchestra in C Minor Op 80 a hastily written occasional composition with amusing premonitions of Symphony No 9 is not one of Beethoven s more inspired creations But the performance is splendid Levin and Gardiner are powerful advocates for a work whose position in the repertory has historically been tenuous It s impossible to arrive at any general conclusions about what sorts of instruments are right for Beethoven s keyboard music It s true that different pieces benefit from different treatment the Op 2 sonatas for example don t need a sound source identical to the Hammerklavier And the coming original instrument performances of the remaining concertos from Levin and Gardiner promise to be revelatory But and Levin is likely to find this praise more infuriating than any criticism had he chosen to play his Emperor on a Steinway or a Bosendorfer he might have given us one of the greatest recordings of the piece ever put on disc
