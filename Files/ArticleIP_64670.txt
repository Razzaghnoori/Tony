 The IRS s Bad Credit Subject The Texas Plan as Desegregator From Josh Pollack Re Date Thu Dec 9 I m surprised that Bruce Gottlieb is so troubled by the Texas California Florida quasi affirmative action collegiate admissions plans If one accepts the need for a corrective or depending on how one views it is willing to live with a mere palliative why not design one that operates in direct proportion to how segregated a state s schools are Of course affirmative action has never been intended as a corrective or palliative for segregation Yet there is surely some considerable connection between segregation school quality and student performance One could argue that absent school segregation any kind of affirmative action admission plans are that much less necessary Thus three states now have automatically self adjusting policies Surely that s not such a terrible outcome To reply click here Subject Texas Plan About Class Not Race From Walter L Williams Re Date Fri Dec 10 In reality it takes more work and more character for poor student X to finish in the top ten percent of his or her public school class and obtain a mediocre SAT score than it does for rich kid Y to finish in the bottom half of his private school class and score slightly higher on the SAT Unlike affirmative action high school quotas avoid giving an advantage based on something other than merit in those situations where student X is white and student Y is a minority To reply click here Subject Connerly No Fan of Compromise From John Archer Re Date Thu Dec 9 It is not true that the Texas Florida and California plans which guarantee the top 10 percent of each high school graduating class admission to a state university have been heralded by Ward Connerly as reported in this article Mr Connerly strongly criticized Gov Jeb Bush s Florida plan in a Nov 18 Wall Street Journal op ed article Why I m Still Fighting Preferences in Florida Part of me applauds Mr Bush for trying to reach a compromise on this issue he wrote But some things can t be compromised and equality under the law is one of them Mr Bush s initiative falls short in several areas Slate should correct this misrepresentation of Mr Connerly s views To reply click here Subject Visa The Tax Cheat Helper From Daniel Thomas Re Date Wed Dec 8 I am not a lawyer but I can understand why Visa won t accept tax payments by credit card If you fail to pay your taxes the IRS can seize your assets But if a credit card company pays your taxes and then you don t pay the credit card company what measures can the credit card company take to get its money I can t imagine that in court the debt you owe to the IRS is equivalent to the debt you owe your credit card company This seems like a real good deal for the IRS and a horrible idea for the credit card companies In effect the IRS is using them as a collection agency To reply click here Subject The Measure of Subjectivity From Tom Stevens Re Date Wed Nov 10 In the Everyday Economics article of Nov 8 Landsburg cites an October 18 th New York Times editorial in which I am quoted as an environmentalist who is skeptical about the concept of existence value because the numbers might not add up in our favor This statement is then used to argue that I do not value intellectual consistency I would simply like to set the record straight I was partially misquoted by the Times and Landsburg s interpretation of my statement is not accurate My concern about existence value is that it is very hard to measure and one can generate almost any number one wants to So I am concerned that some groups will attempt to measure existence value in such a way that they do in fact come up with a number that is in their favor This is my concern it is not what I advocate As a University Professor I make every attempt to be objective I value intellectual consistency highly I am therefore quite sad that the opposite impression is being conveyed With respect to existence value the real problem is that its measurement often becomes subjective To reply click here Tom Stevens is a professor of resource economics at the University of Massachusetts
