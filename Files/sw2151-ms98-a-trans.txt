 okay what do you think about the idea of uh okay kids having to do public service work for a year do you think it s a well i i think it s a pretty good deal i think they should either do that or or or afford some time to the military or or helping elderly people i yes yes definitely i i d you know i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help and i think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home and that s true i m not sure that that s not a bad idear and or the military for a year or two wouldn t be bad for i think it teaches kids how to grow how about yourself yeah uh i agree with you um um what i m thinking about is back oh when i was a kid and much earlier than that kids were kind of you know the parents kind of pushed them to join like the Boy Scouts or the Girl Scouts and they did do do do a lot of public service activities but these days they re not um parents parents aren t encouraging their kids to do things like that because when i was in the Girl Scouts we did a lot of public service things because that s just part of of of the scouting and you know yeah i ve i that s really great i i really think that both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is a excellent two excellent organizations they are but parents but you know they kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that and and they don t follow it at all you know there re very few scouts go on and become Eagle Scouts and and i don t know what the high rank is for the gals but yeah they do oh no i i a senior ah senior okay so there s not uh oh they re just not um once they get into junior high they just not done anymore yeah they they lose interest and then when they young young adults there s even less interest they re they re more for um hum i guess uh not not yeah i mean me yeah you re absolutely right i think it s a really a good thing i i like to see me grab grab grab walk yeah of course there s you know third world countries that can use all kind of help yeah but there s a lot that can be done right here in this country too but i think we ought to start right here at home i m you know yeah um i m not i m not so sure that overseas help helping overseas would be such a hot idea for some for uh a lot of young kids people no it it but uh since there is much that needs to be done here i think that yeah i think that we need to really address what we ve done here and and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives a much broader outlook um hum well it s been really good we talked about this for a few minutes and uh hopefully we ll have another good topic maybe another call someday but i i don t really have too much more to say on this topic i guess no uh i agree with you we i guess we both agree that it s a good thing that they should do sometime well you take care and and enjoy the day thank you ma am bye bye yeah okay you too you too bye bye
