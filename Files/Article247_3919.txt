 Did Gore Hatch Horton Conservative commentators have taken to repeating the mantra that Al Gore introduced Willie Horton the inflammatory racial symbol who enlivened the 1988 presidential race to political debate in America On Oct 24 William Kristol editor and publisher of the Weekly Standard said on ABC s This Week Gore s a mean tough political fighter Gore is the one who introduced Willie Horton to American politics in the 1988 primary against Mike Dukakis Kristol repeated this almost verbatim in a Memo to Bill Bradley that appeared in the issue of Newsweek that hit newsstands the following day Big Al can be a tough mean player After all he s the guy who introduced Willie Horton to the American public in his primary campaign against Michael Dukakis Four days after that Paul Gigot wrote in his Oct 29 Wall Street Journal column Recall that the candidate who first raised the prison furlough Willie Horton issue against Mike Dukakis in 1988 wasn t George Bush It was Al Gore Horton you may recall is a black man who while doing prison time in Massachusetts for murder escaped from a weekend furlough and committed a particularly brutal assault and rape Dukakis hadn t started the state program that allowed prisoners like Horton who were serving life sentences without parole to take furloughs that would have been Dukakis Republican predecessor as governor of Massachusetts Francis Sargent But Dukakis even after hearing what Horton did on his furlough was resistant to ending the program which the state legislature finally did after much crusading by a local newspaper Horton s story was subsequently offered up by Vice President George Bush s campaign as evidence of Dukakis softness on crime and less directly of the Democratic party s excessive fondness for black people It was an ugly election Introducing Willie Horton to American political discourse would not seem to be something to be proud of Is it true that Gore did so And if it is true was Gore s 1988 campaign guilty of injecting cryptic racist messages into the debate The answers to these questions are respectively yes and no Gore did ask Dukakis in a debate right before the 1988 New York primary about weekend passes for convicted criminals Here is how Sidney Blumenthal now a Clinton White House aide but then a reporter for the Washington Post wrote it up a few months later An uncomfortable Dukakis after dispassionately reciting statistics conceded that the Massachusetts furlough program for murderers sentenced to life imprisonment had been canceled The issue did not take for Gore but the exchange attracted the interest of Jim Pinkerton the research director for the then flailing Bush campaign That s the first time I paid attention said Pinkerton I thought to myself This is incredible It totally fell into our lap In reviewing this history it s important to make some crucial distinctions Gore never mentioned that Horton was black indeed he never mentioned Horton by name He merely drew attention correctly to the damaging fact that Dukakis had tolerated a furlough program for especially violent criminals in his state even after a horrific incident strongly suggested this was a bad policy It s conceivable of course that Gore was warming up for more explicit and racially tinged use of Horton s story later in the primary fight But that would have been uncharacteristic of him In any event Gore dropped out of the race shortly after the debate Now recall what the Republicans did with Horton s story An independent expenditure group aired an ad for Bush showing a picture of Horton A Republican fund raising letter in Maryland showed pictures of Dukakis and Horton alongside the following text Is this your pro family team for 1988 Horton told Playboy magazine in 1989 that a woman who identified herself as working for an organization affiliated with the Bush campaign phoned him and wrote letters to him up in prison trying to get him to endorse Dukakis The official Bush campaign of course kept its distance from such efforts and claimed to use Horton only in race neutral ways But there is plenty of evidence that it was heartily appreciative of the racial subtext In his book about the 1988 campaign Pledging Allegiance Blumenthal quotes an anonymous member of the Bush campaign team as saying Willie Horton has star quality Willie s going to be politically furloughed to terrorize again It s a wonderful mix of liberalism and a big black rapist Although Bush s campaign manager Lee Atwater always insisted publicly that for the Bush campaign Horton was never a racial symbol Atwater slipped in a speech he gave to southern Republicans right before that year s Democratic convention There is a story about a fellow named Willie Horton who for all I know may end up to be Dukakis running mate Dukakis is making Hamlet look like the rock of Gibraltar in the way he s acted on this This was a reference to Dukakis search for a vice presidential candidate The guy was on TV about a month ago and he said you ll never see me standing in the driveway of my house talking to these candidates And guess what on Monday I saw in the driveway of his house Jesse Jackson So anyway maybe he ll put this Willie Horton guy on the ticket after all is said and done As was noted at the time by Thomas Edsall of the Washington Post and others Atwater was pretty clearly equating Jesse Jackson with Willie Horton because both happened to be black Gore never did that He never did anything close to that
