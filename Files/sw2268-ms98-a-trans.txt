 what kind of fishing do you enjoy well uh normally i like to to go out fishing in a boat and uh rather than like bank fishing and just like you try and catch anything that s swimming because i ve had such problems of trying to catch any type of fish that uh i just really enjoy doing the boat type fishing so you like fresh water uh huh uh huh i ve never tried like with deep uh sea water fishing uh huh because you get i get sea sick but one of these days i m going hoping they ll have some kind of medicine so i can go out and go uh deep sea fishing now that would be nice oh i see well i was raised on the Texas Gulf Coast in the summers and during the Christmas holidays we d go down to our house on the coast have you uh um hum and so i thought fish came out of the ocean oh my goodness and anything that was fresh water was muddy uh huh so i didn t learn to fish in a lake until i was well into my twenties wow so i had i had always been a a sea fisher type which is a lot of fun um hum um hum oh i bet it is there s so many different ways to catch fish you know at night you can um hum go walking in the shallows and gig flounder and things like that which isn t technically fishing but it s a lot of fun uh huh so i i grew up fishing uh huh what area lakes do you like well uh now i haven t done much fishing here in Texas uh because i moved from Ohio oh i see uh but uh we did a lot of fishing when we were up there but down here i have a brother that likes to go over on the east in East Texas and do fishing and i can t remember what the name of the lake is and he was just here this past weekend i could have i i think he mentioned it again but i couldn t remember what it was um i want to call it Salt Fork or Lake Fork i i can t remember but he said it s one of the best bass fishing places oh oh oh uh i think i know where uh Lake Caddo or something like that i you know that may be it that may be it and it if it s supposed to be one of the best bass fishing places they hold tournaments there and everything yeah yeah yeah and he said that he has never gone anywhere before and he s fished all over the United States in which they can catch the biggest bass that you ve ever seen so i would love to go over there they were talking about going over there and some time this spring and i was thinking it would be great to go over there to go fishing and uh and catch some bass i would love to do that but they have snakes over there and i m not too welcome around i don t i really don t want to share a boat with a snake uh huh uh huh i just i i i don t see it yeah i just i don t i think that i perhaps would let them have the boat or something i d make some quick arrangements that s true and i ve heard so many stories about the snakes uh huh you know when they pull in there s a snake instead of a fish and things like that that i m just yeah oh i don t know what s the largest fish you ever caught yeah um gosh i think it was only like three and a half pounds and for me that s big that s why i m saying i love to go fishing because i ve never caught anything really really big um so because it s always been you know in the on a lake and uh i know they have bigger fish than that but you know three and a half pounds and that was huge for me on a lake yeah on a lake on a lake that s not a bad size fish yeah no that s a good size fish i i would be impressed i mean you know yeah yeah so uh but yeah i d love to go catch catch like the Marlins or whatever in the deep sea fishing i ve never done that uh huh i ve i ve seen it uh and and i have no problem going out in a boat uh it s just so dreadfully expensive and there s just so many other ways you know when you live down there yeah it s not a treat um hum it s what you do every day you know that s right that s right uh one of my favorite things was we were forever catching crab and steaming them yeah you know out on the on the beach uh huh and you know just uh pitching them out on uh on uh what am i trying to say newspaper um hum and and breaking them up and sitting out there and eating them and then digging a hole and pitching the whole thing in it you know and and that s it wow uh huh yeah and uh the the other little creatures would take care of what was left that s right that s right so going out on a boat never did appeal to me simply because it you know there was so much else to do right right well do you live like along uh Houston no down there no no i live in Dallas well i meant when when you were when you were growing up i mean like Galveston i lived in Dallas oh okay but you uh we had a house in Port Aransas oh okay okay it s a little fishing village that is that s close to uh South Padre oh Corpus okay corpus well uh South Padre is on down the bend okay okay it s like if you drew a line from Austin straight down it would be in that region um hum um hum small island yeah yeah i i ve been to Port Aransas but it was when i was a child uh oh okay yes because i have relatives who live in Houston so when would go and we would go to Port Aransas or then on down to Corpus or further yeah like what your talking about because i was just wondering we went to Galveston this this summer even with all the oil spills and everything i mean i was was it bad oh it was horrible i well never ever go back i don t think uh and yeah and that that s true um oh i hate to hear that uh you know the the water was murky and i would hate to think about catching fish or anything there huh uh huh uh no i wouldn t want to eat them you know so yeah no no no you went to Galveston uh i have a favorite hotel that extends out over the water um hum the uh what is it the Flagship yes uh huh is it still there it sure is yeah yeah it most certainly is so uh so that it it was it was certain things that were enjoyable about it but uh i don t i think it s lost a lot of it s appeal i like that place that then because of all the oil spills that they have had and uh it always smelled the entire time we were there it was i didn t realize that had happened for some reason yeah we went swimming one time in the whole week that we were there and the rest of the time we stayed in the pool because the water was so awful and well of course being raised on the water i d never swim in it yeah yeah huh uh swimming is for swimming yeah pool that s why they call them swimming pools uh huh uh huh that s where you swim you do not swim in the ocean no no not anymore no i ve seen what comes out of the ocean and i have no desire to share any space with anything like that but really huge sharks are down there i mean uh huh incredibly large sharks uh huh uh some of the young dread naughty boys in my family would fish for them all night um hum it was incredible the size of them that we would see on the the next morning they would have them strung up across the wow uh huh and it you know so if strung up their tails would still hang on the bottom of the uh just wow wow yeah now i never knew they were that that big huh kind of kind of nothing i won t have anything to do with yeah yeah right well it was nice talking to you well it certainly was um maybe you can get how many have you had very many of these calls um yeah almost everyday how wonderful yeah almost almost every single day from when they started it how wonderful yeah maybe i ll be so lucky okay i enjoyed talking to you okay bye bye bye bye
