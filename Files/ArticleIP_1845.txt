 Geraldine Ferraro New Yorkers won t wait for much but they apparently will wait for Geraldine Ferraro For the last 12 months the ex vice presidential candidate has been mulling over the idea of quitting her Crossfire job to run for office She s about to make her decision Ferraro will announce in the next two weeks whether she s entering New York s 1998 Democratic senatorial primary also known as the race to decide who gets to mud wrestle Sen Alfonse D Amato Ferraro s Godot act has overshadowed the campaigns of the two declared primary contenders Rep Charles Schumer and New York City Public Advocate Mark Green New York political bosses and big donors are biding their time waiting for her announcement The fund raising group EMILY s List which could steer 1 million to its chosen candidate has encouraged members to withhold contributions till Ferraro makes her decision The latest Quinnipiac College Poll a respected independent survey shows Ferraro massacring Schumer and Green in the primary and routing D Amato by 14 points in the general election This enthusiasm is a little mystifying After all the 62 year old has served a grand total of six years in public office all in the House of Representatives has not won an election since 1982 was brutalized in her last two campaigns 1984 vice presidential and 1992 senatorial and has been tangled in more ethics scandals than any politician except well Al D Amato A little ethnic arithmetic explains some of the Ferraro excitement She s Italian Schumer and Green are Jewish D Amato beats any Jew and he loses to any Italian says a longtime New York political operative But Ferraro owes her popularity to something else the Ferraro Aura try saying that three times quickly To this day Ferraro is defined by 1984 by the four months 13 years ago when she was the most famous woman in the world Democrats especially middle aged women remember her at the Democratic National Convention remember her white dress remember her introduction which brought the house down My name is Geraldine Ferraro The Mondale Ferraro campaign degenerated into a wretched embarrassing spectacle but Ferraro proved that a woman could be just as good and just as bad a vice presidential candidate as any man Ferraro Maureen Dowd wrote came to embody the Cinderella myth the American dream and the feminine mystique rolled into one Her admirers stopped seeing her as a politician She became an icon an unreal idealized symbol of women s achievement But this image distorts Ferraro As an individual rather than a symbol she s wonderfully engaging charming tough smart funny thoughtful But she is also very much a politician self aggrandizing ambitious and acutely sensitive to political wind shifts Few New Yorkers let alone few Americans remember her six years in Congress and with good reason She was a pork barreler and a more or less willing cog in the Queens Democratic machine Her path to Washington was cleared by the fact that her cousin Nicholas Ferraro was the Queens district attorney and a political player Ferraro had enough principles to stand on not enough to get in her way Despite her lionization by feminists for example Ferraro was not terribly progressive on women s issues She was pro choice but not emphatically so She supported the Equal Rights Amendment but then maneuvered to keep it out of the 1984 Democratic platform Her skills as an operator served her own career When she arrived in Congress in 1979 she quickly inserted herself under the wing of House Speaker Tip O Neill His sponsorship was critical to her vice presidential nomination Ferraro seems to favor retail politics over ideology like D Amato She has never attached herself to any particular set of ideas never had any consuming passion It s notable that none of the seven New York Democratic operatives I talked to could describe her ideology or name her pet causes She s sort of moderate I think said one When I asked Ferraro about her key issues her answer was boilerplate Education the struggling economy of upstate New York D Amato s horrendous record Even her responses to ethics charges reflect her political instincts Confronted with allegations about campaign finance irregularities or with questions about her husband s business dealings Ferraro has bobbed and weaved with Clintonian deftness Hand out a few documents hedge cavil deny admit with explanation All of which is to say Of course she ll run She s a natural born politician and she can t stay away from the race She sounds thrilled when she considers the prospect If you look at the time of my life that was the happiest it was the time as a prosecutor and member of Congress she says I am 30 points ahead in the primary And I am the only one who beats Al D Amato Ferraro has always wanted to take on Sen Pothole She reluctantly skipped the 1986 campaign because of ethics problems Scandal dogged her again in 1992 when she lost a vicious four way primary This year is her last chance at Al It s either do it now or don t do it at all It s not likely to be an easy primary Schumer has raised 8 million and is a relentless campaigner Green has a loyal following among the liberals who vote in Democratic primaries Ferraro says she needs to raise 5 5 million to win the primary It will be a fratricidal exhausting race And if she wins D Amato will be no pushover The bars of New York are filled with politicians who led D Amato in the polls a year before Election Day He always polls low he has 15 million to spend in the general election and he solidified his base with lots of And D Amato will not underestimate Ferraro whom he fears most of all his potential opponents He has already fired a shot across her bow In October he ran TV ads between segments of Crossfire no less slamming Ferraro as a pro tax and welfare liberal The ads mimicked Crossfire s format On the left it s Geraldine Ferraro And on our side it s Al D Amato An icon would have ignored the attack but Ferraro harpooned right back calling the ad a sign of panic When Republicans asked CNN to drop Ferraro from Crossfire complaining that she was using the program to advance her candidacy Ferraro countered that i t s almost unbecoming to see grown men whine If New Yorkers are lucky this sniping is a preview of a delightful fall campaign two leather skinned fast talking old time pols whaling the bejesus out of each other That s the kind of politics everyone enjoys not least Geraldine Ferraro
