 In Praise of Clinton s Brain In his Dec 9 press conference Bill Clinton perhaps inadvertently stimulated some thoughts about his presidential legacy Asked who he would name as man of the century Clinton chose Franklin Roosevelt reportedly Time magazine has made the same choice Clinton told the famous story of Roosevelt on first being elected president in 1932 visiting the nonagenarian Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes prompting Holmes to observe that while Roosevelt didn t have a first class mind he had a first class temperament By now it s well understood that Clinton lacks a first class or even a second class temperament He can t control his impulses especially the libidinal ones he has an unattractive tendency to blame other people for his problems he has a terrifyingly effective gift for misleading and occasionally telling outright lies People who work for him rarely come away from the experience with a high opinion of his character Chatterbox continues to believe that the nation and without question Al Gore would have been better off had Clinton chosen to resign the presidency in the summer of 1998 But though Clinton lacks a first class temperament he possesses a first class mind By this Chatterbox doesn t mean only that Clinton is knowledgeable and smart Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon were knowledgeable and smart too but they weren t particularly good presidents As the former Carter speechwriter James Fallows famously observed in an Atlantic Monthly article The Passionless Presidency Carter had a habit of deploying his intelligence toward pathetically small matters like deciding who could use the White House tennis court Nixon meanwhile was someone whose brilliance blended seamlessly into paranoia doing serious damage to his judgment Clinton by contrast is someone whose brain unlike other parts of his body seems always to be deployed in just the right places shining light on an astonishing variety of important matters Check out his comments at yesterday s press conference on trade Chechnya and health care among others The many accomplishments of Clinton s administration most especially his management of the economy resulted much more from the sharpness and discipline of Clinton s mind than from the shiftiness and dithering of Clinton s temperament which some people have mistaken for brilliant leadership There are many smart people running for president this year but none of them will likely match Clinton s ability to wear his intelligence so lightly and so well Anyone who s ever read Al Gore s Earth in the Balance knows that Gore s formidable intelligence is a clunky suit of armor Fortunately when Gore isn t in his tortured intellectual mode his judgment is much better Bill Bradley s intelligence has a narcissistic quality too often focused on demonstrating its exquisite sensitivity John McCain s intelligence like his temperament is impulsive in the best and worst senses For an example of the latter see Who s Afraid of an Internet Tax Steve Forbes is monomaniacal and deluded Gary Bauer s Pat Buchanan s and Alan Keyes are completely devoted to articulating magnificently well their extremist ideologies Orrin Hatch and George W Bush well let s just say both are emphasizing character and quantity of experience above all else Chatterbox will not miss many things about Clinton when he s gone But he will miss his brain and that will be missing a lot subsequently Chatterbox s boss at U S News World Report
