 The Los Angeles Times Lockyer Warns of Firms Posing as Legal Aid Services Jocelyn Y Stewart Friday July 5 2002 State Atty Gen Bill Lockyer is warning Californians to beware of businesses that advertise legal aid or legal services only to provide costly and shoddy services that may hurt clients in court The warning in a recently released consumer alert is a reaction to businesses that prey on the public s trust in legitimate legal aid organizations The true nonprofit legal services organizations in California provide indispensable free legal assistance to consumers who can t afford to hire an attorney but need help while facing dangerous domestic violence situations evictions from their homes and other emergencies Lockyer said in the alert Legal aid services are nonprofit publicly funded organizations that provide services to low income clients at no charge or for a minimal fee Certain court forms refer the poor to legal aid But some businesses staffed by people who are not attorneys have adopted legal aid or similar names leading some people to believe that they are nonprofits In Los Angeles many of the victims ended up at the office of the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles a legitimate nonprofit organization Elena Popp executive director of the foundation welcomed the attorney general s alert It is actually very painful for us to see people come into this office having paid 400 500 600 to someone to prepare paperwork that is badly done said Popp So they ve been ripped off once by having to pay this fee and then in court by losing their case In May the attorney general s office filed a friend of the court brief in support of four Shasta County residents who won a case against Modesto resident Walter Moore who also used the name Jeff Simmons The four plaintiffs all of whom were facing eviction said they were deceived into calling Moore by his use of the term legal aid in advertising Here we have a profit seeking businessman who s not a lawyer calling himself Legal Aid in the Yellow Pages and on the Internet said Gary Rhoades litigation director for the Housing Rights Center and lead attorney on the case Moore operated a business offering several types of legal services through advertisements that appeared in cities throughout the state During the trial former Moore employees said they had been trained to tell callers they were the same legal aid mentioned in court forms Moore s business charged 85 to 400 to type simple forms Rhoades said The jury found Moore guilty of violating the Unlawful Detainer Assistance Act and of practicing law without a license and acting with fraud malice or oppression The judge determined that Moore had violated California s Unfair Business Practices and False Advertising Laws In February 2001 the judge ordered Moore to pay restitution and issued a statewide injunction prohibiting Moore and his associates from using the term legal aid and similar names The court ordered Moore to advertise the verdict in newspapers in 22 cities The case is on appeal To verify that a legal aid organization is federally funded or to find a local nonprofit legal aid office consumers may refer to the Legal Services Corp s Web site www lsc gov fundprog htm Those who have been victimized by document preparers who are not attorneys should call their local district attorney or the Attorney General s Public Inquiry Unit at 800 952 5225 Complaints may be filed online at http www ag ca gov consumers Those in need of assistance may call the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles at 800 399 4529
