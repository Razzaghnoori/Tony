 normally i listen to CNN or Headline News about an hour a day and then i supplement that with uh radio news from my car radio and from a news magazine once a week do you and a newspaper if i have time yeah i don t usually have time to read the newspaper everyday so i try to listen to the radio in the morning and and try to catch one of the morning talk shows and then i usually end up flipping through CNN and Headline News during the evening i always try to read the Sunday paper just because it usually gives a summary of the the week s hot events so i try to i try to catch that if nothing else that s true and and how do you rate the uh how are you pleased with the news coverage that you re receiving for for local news i think we do real well where it s we live in a kind of small town but i think we get excellent local coverage um and i like the national news that we see we we watch NBC and i think they do a real good job so i m i ve been real pleased with the quality of the news we get how about you on the whole i m pleased when i have an opportunity to hear just the facts i would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves um since i don t necessarily agree with it or it tends to be extraordinarily trite right uh i think i m fed up with trite there seems to be more and more of it and i understand the void that uh comes naturally with both radio presentations and television presentations and as as expensive as they are to produce they certainly don t want any dead airspace uh huh yeah but i think there s enough news out there that they could pass on more factual information to us and like you said save the commentaries because i m going to listen to the the news and draw my own opinions i don t really need their help to do that i i we re certainly in agreement there i don t think radio is as bad to do that as TV is uh radio seems to have a full platter or full plate of different things that they need to get done they re maybe they re a little more efficient um hum or have more to do over that same time frame i don t know which that answer is right uh i think the my greatest complaint about news programs is programs like Sixty Minutes do you watch that i used to but i don t anymore maybe once or twice a year well i used to watch Sixty Minutes until they did two programs uh that i knew both the people and the incidences incidences uh huh and i knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint really that was in my estimate nowhere near truth but was much better for ratings yes and it ever since that time i just don t watch uh so i guess we have the the same reaction whether we came about it from the same place or not yeah well i had heard a couple of people you know that i had talked to about certain programs say that you know they had read other things besides what Sixty Minutes presented and that they didn t present it nearly the same way as the you know news articles or whatever they had they had already been familiar with so i started questioning just how how bias they really were so i don t know did i don t know how old you are but it seems to me like the last uh newscaster that presented news in just the nice simple factual way that i wanted to hear was Walter Cronkite hum so i don t i don t know if you re familiar with him or not no not really you know in the last few years just his kind of informal segments i ve seen but i never got to see his actual nightly news i liked i i did grow up with David Brinkley well Brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold uh uh huh of Cronkite and he did a a pretty good job The Huntley Brinkley Report was quite excellent over the years yeah we we used to watch um him and i guess John Chancellor and i always liked David Brinkley and i and i used to enjoy John Chancellor s style of reporting but on the nightly news now he goes into his commentary and that s where i get get into the problem with with him i frequently disagree with his commentaries so well once they ve reported the facts all they can offer is an opinion anymore right what did you think of the news coverage of the war well i almost felt like it was too much indeed i found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day one in the morning and one in the evening um hum uh i spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst really and i don t need their fill ins you know did that help you understand a lot what was going on your your prior experience with the military did yes but i i think it helps me everyday in trying to review what the state that the world is in and try to guess where we re going i wondered if it would help you sometimes fill in the gaps or recognize discrepancies that other people people like myself might not pick up on well i i think uh my background is probably what absolutely turned me off with Sixty Minutes okay what weekly um magazine do you look at is it i like US News and World Report at one time or another i ve taken them all for a year i believe in giving anything a chance uh huh sure uh but i keep coming back to that one so i that s kind of my favorite does it give a pretty good overview of everything or like does it give um i guess little encapsulated reports and and then a few big stories it s primarily um a few big stories and then lots of high level reports yeah uh here s what went on in Asia over the past week and there s maybe a page of that little brief paragraphs unless that was one of their the focus of their main stories that sounds good if you were short on time you could get a summary real quick uh it too is one those you know in the interest of efficiency we all have to find ways and i do most of my reading in the bathroom right um and it s one of those that i can either read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that i m going to spend in there right and it just seems to fit nicely so that i can get it read in about three days well we re working on a Newsweek uh for the last couple of months we got you know an introductory sub scription so we decided to try it because prior to that all we got were things like Glamour or Sports Illustrated so we decided to try to bring one in that was a little bit better for us so to speak well to broaden your horizons make you think about different things anyway it can t hurt well anytime that we stop and think it can t hurt no i i even i enjoy reading T News i try to catch it because it s another example they just they just show you the words and the facts and they they don t offer any commentary and it gives me a quick chance to to be caught up during the day because you know we don t listen to the radio at work at all so i don t like to go the whole day without hearing anything oh i m with you i have to check T News every everyday it s my noontime dose of facts yeah and the other thing we have that i like to check sometimes is um Talking Fingers do you have that no you have different telephone numbers that you can dial and then you dial in an access code and it will depending on what topic you called in to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update it will give you um updated information so it can give you you know current news updates current weather updates things like that and it s it s offered through the local phone company free of charge hum so that s an interesting alternative occasionally that i like to use well it does sound very interesting maybe our phone company out here will get around to offering something like that it it really is yeah it really is nice i mean because it gives you a wide variety of things you can call and talk and find out about so that is something you might keep your eyes open for i think it s it s catching on throughout the country
