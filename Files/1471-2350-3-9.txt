 Background Hemochromatosis is common among northwestern European peoples and their descendants This disorder is typically associated with homozygosity for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene exon 2 nt 845 G A on Ch6p 1 C282Y lies within an ancestral haplotype which includes the human leukocyte antigen HLA haplotype A 03 B 07 2 3 4 5 The ancestral haplotype is the predominant hemochromatosis associated haplotype in many northwestern European countries including Ireland 6 Brittany 2 Denmark 7 8 Sweden 9 and Germany 10 11 This is attributed to the origin of the C282Y mutation on an A 03 B 07 haplotype in northwestern Europe and its early dissemination by Vikings 3 12 Modification of the ancestral chromosome by recombination and admixture as a result of geographic migration explains the occurrence of chromosomes bearing C282Y in association with different HLA haplotypes 2 4 8 13 14 15 16 Thus some non ancestral haplotypes also occur with significantly increased frequencies in hemochromatosis patients in various countries in Europe and in descendants of Europeans 5 16 In North America phenotype frequencies of HLA alleles in persons with hemochromatosis and in control populations have been reported from Canada Utah and Minnesota 17 18 19 HLA haplotype frequencies for hemochromatosis patients and control subjects in North America have been reported only from Utah 20 The purpose of the present work was to quantify and analyze the frequencies of HLA A and B alleles and haplotypes in hemochromatosis probands with C282Y homozygosity in central Alabama and to compare the present results to those reported in other populations Subjects and Methods Selection of subjects Hemochromatosis probands The performance of this work was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Brookwood Medical Center and the University of Alabama at Birmingham A presumptive diagnosis of hemochromatosis was established using an elevated transferrin saturation criterion each proband was subsequently evaluated for iron overload and its complications 21 22 23 All probands in the present study were white adults 18 years of age Probands were included who had a diagnosis of hemochromatosis in routine medical care during the interval 1997 2001 b C282Y homozygosity c available HLA A and B typing and d residence in central Alabama No patient declined to undergo HFE mutation analysis after it was determined that he she had a hemochromatosis phenotype There were A and B typing data in 139 probands Haplotypes could not be determined in 21 probands due to similarities in alleles of probands and family members or due to unavailability of family members for analysis Thus there were haplotype data on 118 probands Control subjects Data from 1 321 apparently normal unrelated white adult subjects from Alabama who had undergone A and B phenotype analysis as part of paternity testing were used to estimate allele and gene frequencies 21 R T Acton unpublished observations A and B haplotypes were determined in 605 unrelated white subjects from Alabama children and their mothers and or putative fathers who had undergone testing to establish paternity Laboratory methods Serum iron concentration transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration were measured using automated clinical methods Sections of liver biopsy specimens were stained using hematoxylin and eosin Masson s trichrome and Perls Prussian blue techniques intrahepatocytic iron was graded according to the method of Scheuer et al 24 HFE mutation analysis was performed as previously described 23 A and B alleles were detected using low resolution DNA based typing PCR sequence specific oligonucleotide probe in probands 23 Control subjects were tested using the microdroplet lymphocytotoxicity test 25 subjects were evaluated using antisera that detected allele assignments described in the 9 thInternational Histocompatibility Workshop 26 Because the levels of resolution of the DNA based and serological typing methods we used are similar alleles detected by these respective methods provide concordant allele assignments with the exception of B 70 and B 71 that were not detected by serological methods HFE mutation analysis and HLA typing of family members were performed to permit assignment of Ch6p haplotypes In each proband in whom a single A or B allele was detected by DNA based typing we verified the allele s and set phase to ascertain haplotypes of the proband using HFE and HLA analyses of appropriate family members For the present analysis all haplotypes were defined only by A and B alleles and the ancestral haplotype was defined as a hemochromatosis associated Ch6p bearing A 03 B 07 and HFE C282Y Literature review For most comparisons recent tabulations of A and B allele associations in 21 case control studies from thirteen countries and A and B haplotype analyses in persons with hemochromatosis and control subjects in eight countries or regions were used 16 We also made computerized and manual searches to identify estimates of the prevalence of C282Y homozygosity in hemochromatosis cases in various countries or regions for which A and B haplotype data were also available Statistical considerations A data set that included HLA types in 139 probands and haplotypes in 118 probands was available Absolute or uncorrected values of A and B phenotype frequencies in probands respective frequencies of A and B genes A and B haplotype frequencies and occurrence of two haplotype combinations were calculated after enumeration of the raw data Some previously reported hemochromatosis associated HLA broad specificities are designated herein as corresponding splits A 09 A 23 and A 24 B 05 B 51 and B 52 and B 12 B 44 and B 45 respectively 26 A computer spreadsheet Excel 2000 Microsoft Corp Redmond WA and a statistical program GB Stat v 8 0 2000 Dynamic Microsystems Inc Silver Spring MD were used to perform the present analyses Frequency values were compared using chi square analysis or one tail Fisher s exact test as appropriate A value of p 0 05 was defined as significant and these values were expressed to four significant figures Odds ratios OR were calculated as previously described 27 Bonferroni s correction for multiple tests was not performed because many of the HLA associations with hemochromatosis reported herein have been described elsewhere Results Hemochromatosis probands There were 87 men ages 51 4 years mean 1 S D and 52 women ages 50 5 years Iron overload was detected using serum ferritin

probands Table 4 Comparison of Alabama hemochromatosis probands with persons with hemochromatosis in other locations HLA A and B alleles We compared the present results with data in a previously published tabulation of A and B allele associations in 21 case control studies from 13 countries or regions in Europe Australia and North America 16 This tabulation yielded a mean A 03 phenotype frequency of 0 75 range 0 53 0 83 in hemochromatosis patients and 0 25 range 0 19 0 31 in control subjects 16 In Alabama subjects therefore the A 03 phenotype frequencies in probands 0 7482 and control subjects 0 2739 were similar to the corresponding mean values previously tabulated 16 However the OR for hemochromatosis associated with A 03 in Alabama probands 7 9 was somewhat greater than the corresponding mean value of aggregate data from the tabulation OR 6 6 range 3 8 15 1 95 confidence interval 5 7 7 6 16 HLA A and B haplotypes We compared the present results with data in a previously published tabulation of A and B haplotypes which occurred with significantly greater frequency in hemochromatosis patients than in corresponding control patients data were available from Germany Denmark Sweden Brittany Portugal Italy Australia and Utah Table 5 Additional file 3 16 31 Frequencies of the A 03 B 07 haplotype were increased in all hemochromatosis patient groups The frequencies of the A 03 B 14 haplotype were significantly increased in persons with hemochromatosis in Brittany Sweden Utah and Alabama Table 5 Additional file 3 31 A significantly increased absolute frequency of the haplotype A 03 B 35 occurred in Alabama probands and in hemochromatosis patients in Italy 29 A significantly increased frequency of the haplotype A 03 B 15 was observed in the present Alabama hemochromatosis probands a relative increase in this haplotype was detected in hemochromatosis cohorts in Brittany and Utah 2 20 A significantly increased frequency of the haplotype A 03 B 44 was observed in the present Alabama hemochromatosis probands whereas a relative increase in this haplotype was reported in hemochromatosis cohorts in Sweden Brittany and Utah only after correction of the data for the preponderance of other haplotypes Table 5 Additional file 3 31 The increased frequencies of the A 01 B 60 A 02 B 39 A 02 B 62 A 03 B 13 A 03 B 27 A 03 B 47 and A 03 B 57 haplotypes observed in Alabama probands in the present study were not reported in persons with hemochromatosis in the seven other countries for which data were available Table 5 Additional file 3 31 Additional File 3 Click here for file Discussion A 03 positivity was detected in more than 74 of Alabama C282Y homozygous hemochromatosis probands in the present study Similarly the frequency of A 03 positivity was significantly increased in Alabama hemochromatosis probands diagnosed before the discovery of HFE 21 These observations are consistent with and extend the findings of 21 previously reported case controlled studies from thirteen countries which demonstrate the significantly increased prevalence of A 03 in persons with hemochromatosis 16 The alleles B 07 and B 14 were also more common in the present Alabama probands and in Alabama probands diagnosed before discovery of HFE than in corresponding control subjects 21 The present analysis demonstrates that this is attributable largely to the association of B 07 and B 14 with A 03 consistent with observations in persons with hemochromatosis patients from many locations including Ireland 6 Brittany 2 32 33 34 Denmark 7 8 Sweden 9 35 36 Germany 10 11 37 38 Portugal 30 39 Italy 2 40 and Utah 20 The frequency of the ancestral haplotype defined by A 03 B 07 in the present Alabama probands is greater than that reported in persons with hemochromatosis reported from most other areas It is possible that our method of selection of subjects for the present study could partly account for this We selected only probands who had a hemochromatosis phenotype and C282Y homozygosity Across other studies of HLA haplotypes in subjects with hemochromatosis criteria for definition of hemochromatosis phenotypes differed Some studies included probands whereas others included probands and all family members with hemochromatosis some required demonstration of segregation with HLA haplotypes and others did not 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 None used HFE mutation analysis as an inclusion criterion as we required in the present study In several countries in northwestern Europe however the percentage of C282Y homozygotes in hemochromatosis case series is greater than 90 33 34 35 37 38 In Queensland a frequency of C282Y homozygosity of 100 was reported among patients identified by phenotype criteria 42 Thus the selection criterion of C282Y homozygosity in the present study nonetheless resulted in a group of hemochromatosis probands the HFE genotypes of which are similar to those of hemochromatosis patients of northwestern European descent in other studies The absolute frequencies of haplotypes A 01 B 60 A 02 B 39 A 02 B 62 A 03 B 13 A 03 B 15 A 03 B 27 A 03 B 35 A 03 B 44 A 03 B 47 and A 03 B 57 in addition to A 03 B 07 and A 03 B 14 haplotypes were significantly greater in Alabama probands than in control subjects A significantly increased absolute frequency of the haplotype A 03 B 35 has also been reported in hemochromatosis patients in Italy 29 The present observations regarding this haplotype may be attributable to the large subgroup of persons of Italian and Sicilian descent in central Alabama 44 A significantly increased frequency of the haplotype A 03 B 15 was observed in the present Alabama hemochromatosis probands whereas a relative increase in this haplotype was detected in hemochromatosis cohorts in Brittany and Utah only after correction of the data for the preponderance of other haplotypes 2 20 Similarly a significantly increased frequency of the haplotype A 03 B 44 was observed in the present Alabama hemochromatosis probands whereas a relative increase in this haplotype was detected in hemochromatosis cohorts in Sweden Brittany and Utah after correction of the data for the preponderance of other haplotypes 2 8 19 The absolute frequency of the haplotype A 03 B 47 was increased in central Alabama hemochromatosis probands whereas a corrected frequency of A 03 B 47 was increased in hemochromatosis patients from Denmark 8 The other aforementioned haplotypes except A 03 B 07 and A 03 B 14 have not been reported to occur with increased frequency in any hemochromatosis cohort from locations other than Alabama Thus we observed a greater number of haplotypes which were significantly increased in frequency among the present Alabama hemochromatosis probands than have been reported in other hemochromatosis populations including a cohort in Utah 16 This could be attributed to a greater degree of genetic heterogeneity among whites in Alabama consistent with previous reports of genetic characteristics of persons with hemochromatosis in this geographic area 23 45 Alternatively we had greater power to achieve statistical significance in the present analyses than did some other studies Nonetheless the percentage of the present probands who were HLA haploidentical with at least one other proband indicates that the haplotypes among hemochromatosis patients in central Alabama are more restricted than those in the general population 46 47 In Alabama subjects with hemochromatosis the A 03 B 07 haplotype is not invariably associated with inheritance of C282Y The frequency of the A 03 B 07 haplotype was significantly increased in Alabama hemochromatosis probands without C282Y 23 some of whom had the common HFE missense mutation H63D 23 A 03 B 07 haplotypes associated with H63D have also been described in Alabama subjects with primary antibody deficiency 48 Some Alabama subjects with hemochromatosis have an A 03 B 07 haplotype which includes the novel HFE missense mutation I105T 48 Thus a variety of HFE missense mutations occur in association with A 03 B 07 haplotypes in white Alabamians Conclusions A 03 and A 03 B 07 frequencies are increased in Alabama probands like other hemochromatosis cohorts Increased absolute frequencies of the haplotype A 03 B 35 have been reported only in the present Alabama probands and in hemochromatosis patients in Italy Increased absolute frequencies of A 01 B 60 A 02 B 39 A 02 B 62 A 03 B 13 A 03 B 15 A 03 B 27 A 03 B 44 A 03 B 47 and A 03 B 57 were detected in the present cohort of Alabama hemochromatosis probands but these haplotypes have not been reported to occur with increased absolute frequency in other hemochromatosis populations Modification of the ancestral chromosome by recombination and admixture as a result of geographic migration could explain the previously undescribed occurrence of HLA haplotypes that occur in association with C282Y These results could also be explained by the greater degree of genetic heterogeneity in white Alabamians than in other populations and by the larger numbers of probands and control subjects and greater statistical power to demonstrate significant differences in the present study than in some similar previous studies A variety of HFE missense mutations occur in association with A 03 B 07 haplotypes in white
