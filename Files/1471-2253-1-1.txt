 Background Mivacurium is a short acting benzylisoquinoline non depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent with a demonstrated safety and efficacy both in children and adults 1 2 3 It has been in clinical use for a long time and the clinical pharmacology has been widely documented In children administration of isoflurane previous to and during the effect of vecuronium or mivacurium increases their spontaneous recovery times in a time dependent manner 4 5 However these times are not modified if the anesthetic gas is administered after the peak effect of the neuromuscular relaxant is produced 6 Furthermore despite infants usually respond differently to the effects of a neuromuscular relaxant from children or adults do and that isoflurane is commonly used in children including infants only few studies have evaluated the effect of mivacurium during isoflurane anesthesia 4 7 8 In the current study we compared the effect of 200 and 250 g kg of mivacurium in infants during isoflurane anesthesia in order to investigate whether the higher dose resulted in a faster onset of action Spontaneous recovery times and cardiovascular response to the neuromuscular relaxant were also compared Methods Measurements and outcomes For analysis of the effect the neuromuscular response was divided in two phases Response from the baseline until the maximal relaxation was observed and maintained was used to compute the times to a block of 90 OA 90 and 99 9 OA 100 Second response starting with the maximal relaxation until it returned to baseline values was used to obtain the times to spontaneous recovery of 10 25 50 75 and 90 of the neuromuscular function To obtain these parameters both T and T4 T1 responses were analyzed The time course of T or T4 T1 in each phase was considered sigmoidally related to time and equation used to fit them was the following 13 The model used is a logistic equation where E the observed response t the time at which every response was registered E 0 response at zero time b slope factor t 50 time at which half maximal response is given and E max maximal response In all patients the maximal block and maximal recovery were 96 Therefore the E max was obtained by transforming the maximal effect registered by the TOF Guard into the 100 a value fixed into the model All the other values of the effect were then transformed according to the new 100 Value of the E 0 was then also fixed to the model The complete neuromuscular response was fitted to time by using the SigmaPlot 4 01 SPSS M xico Mexico City Mexico for Windows 95 and b and t 50 were computed by iteration Thereafter calculated effect was obtained by proper arrangement of the equation described above For each patient the HR and SBP and DBP were transformed into the area under the heart rate time curve AUC HR and into the area under systolic and diastolic blood pressure time curve AUC SBP and AUC DBP respectively Each AUC was obtained with data obtained immediately after mivacurium was administered until 30 min The AUC s were computed by means of the Microsoft Excel 97 using an adaptation of a standard procedure 14 as follows where Y represents HR SBP or DBP the X is the time at which Y was measured and 1 2 n are the progressive values until the last observation was performed By using this equation the overall response of HR SBP and DBP is obtained and compared between groups avoiding the time by time comparisons Finally the onset of action was considered as the primary outcome of the study while spontaneous recovery times and cardiovascular response as secondary outcomes Statistical analysis All data were presented as mean SD ranges and when indicated the 95 confidence intervals for the difference for parametric data were computed The Student t test was used to compare age and weight between the two groups of treatment while the Fisher exact test was used for comparison of gender The quality of fit of the pharmacodynamic sigmoidal model to the data was judged by correlation coefficient of observed to predicted effect automatically computed by SigmaPlot Visual examination of plots of the ratio of observed to predicted response and plots of observed minus predicted response in function of time was also performed considering a good agreement between observed and predicted response when ratios approached 1 and differences approached 0 The times to OA and to spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular function were also compared between groups by the unpaired Student t test The unpaired Student t test was also used to compare each AUC i e AUC HR AUC SBP and AUC DBP between groups Ancillary analyses In every group the HR and SBP and DBP data obtained 5 min after mivacurium was administered were compared to their respective baseline values by means of the paired Student t test In order to evaluate the effect of age and weight into onset and recovery times data from all children a single linear regression analysis y mx b was performed between each of the onset and recovery times as the dependent or explained variable and age or weight as the independent variable Finally descriptive statistics paired and unpaired Student t test and linear regression analysis were performed using the software WinSTAT R Fitch Software Cambridge MA USA for Microsoft Excel A two tailed probability of p 0 05 was considered significant in every test or analysis Results The two groups were similar in demographic data including gender age and weight Table 1 reflecting a successful randomized procedure All patients reached the maximal 100 relaxation response and received a Fahey scale 0 for tracheal intubation and were extubated and discharged from the operating room with a full recovery of the neuromuscular function T 95 and without any complication of drug administration All infants completed the study and data were analyzed in the group they were randomized Figure 1 Responses from all patients were successfully modeled This was proved by regression coefficients always greater than 96 by plots of ratio of observed to predicted response in function of time approaching 1 and plots of observed minus predicted response in function of time approaching 0 The times to OA and to spontaneous recovery of T and T4 T1 of the two groups were summarized in Tables 2and 3 respectively In relation to T response Table 2 the maximal block with mivacurium 250 g kg appeared one minute faster than 200 g kg p 0 05 whereas spontaneous recovery times were similar between groups However analyzing T4 T1 response similar times to OA and to spontaneous recovery were obtained with both doses Table 3 Additionally no relationship between age or weight and any of the OA or spontaneous recovery times was demonstrated by linear regression analysis In relation to the cardiovascular response the AUC HR was similar in the two groups p 0 05 while both AUC SBP and AUC DBP were significantly lower p 0 05 in patients receiving 250 g kg The HR at 5 min after any dose of mivacurium was administered significantly increased in relation to baseline values p 0 05 while a similar time course of the HR was observed with the two doses of mivacurium Figure 2 The time course of both SBP Figure 3 and DBP Figure 4 reflected the differences observed in their respective AUC s Transient flushing was observed in two cases one female patient weighing 13 kg aged 22 mo and receiving mivacurium 200 g kg and one male patient weighing 8 3 kg aged 8 mo and receiving mivacurium 250 g kg Discussion In this study patients underwent muscle relaxation with mivacurium Anesthesia was intravenously induced and maintained with isoflurane administered when relaxation had reached a maximal response The same clinical model was previously used to evaluate the effects of rocuronium 6 and clearly differs from other studies Mainly intubation followed by gas administration was performed after a maximum neuromuscular block was present avoiding any effect of the anesthetic gas on the times to OA However isoflurane is able to increase twice the spontaneous recovery of vecuronium in children and prolongs recovery times for more than 50 after 30 min of its administration 4 5 In the present study similar spontaneous recovery was observed in the two groups and our results are comparable to 15 20 min for T 90 of Goudsouzian s review article 3 Furthermore our T 25 values are longer than those obtained with 300 g kg of mivacurium under nitrous oxide halothane or nitrous oxide opioid anesthesia 15 These considerations suggest that isoflurane does affect the spontaneous recovery similar to or higher than other anesthetic techniques The duration of action of some non depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents differs with age even when administered in equipotent doses 16 Other studies have also demonstrated age differences of response to mivacurium 4 7 14 17 18 In the current study we obtained no significant relationship between age or weight and any of the OA or spontaneous recovery The range of 6 to 24 months of our patients could be broad to study the effect of age in 24 patients However a Canadian group of pediatric anesthesiologists found similar neuromuscular effects of mivacurium in patients aged between 2 mo to 10 yr 19 20 supporting our results Additionally extremely wide ranges of neuromuscular response in children have been described for other neuromuscular blocking e g T 75 ranged from 27 3 to 91 4 min with rocuronium 800 g kg and T 25 75 ranged from 6 0 22 8 min with rocuronium 600 g kg 6 21 In relation to mivacurium cholinesterase activity level is a major determinant of the spontaneous recovery of mivacurium in pediatric population 8 22 We did not quantify enzyme levels and therefore the inter individual variations of spontaneous recovery times are difficult to be interpreted However coefficient of variations of T response to mivacurium varied from 14 8 to 45 8 and T 75 response ranged from 8 9 to 20 min representing a less markedly variation than rocuronium Furthermore an atypical response was not present in any patient Therefore we considered that our patients were a population without marked differences in plasmatic cholinesterase activity In relation to cardiovascular response administration of mivacurium 200 to 300 g kg in infants and children has demonstrated minor changes or lack of significant changes in HR and blood pressure 14 18 19 23 24 We observed an increment in HR at the first minute reaching the top at 5 min in both groups Agents having varying cardiovascular effects were administered in addition to and preceding the mivacurium when assessing the cardiovascular response Atropine administration and combination of fentanyl and propofol could certainly have an effect on heart rate and blood pressure in our patients However a drop in blood pressures indicated by lower AUC SBP and AUC DBP of patients receiving mivacurium 250 g kg was significant The review article of Goudsouzian states that reported ED 95 of mivacurium for infants ranges from 65 94 g kg 3 The dose of 200 g kg will then be2 to 3 times the referenced ED 95 and 250 will be 2 5 to approximately 4 times We therefore considered that these changes could be mainly related to histamine release with both doses probably more marked with the highest dose Fortunately in most cases the histamine release and cardiovascular changes have lacked clinical significance 25 The TOF Guard was used to evaluate the neuromuscular response Some studies have supported its use by finding that acceleromyography compares closely with other more sophisticated equipment 26 27 whereas clinical trials using the TOF Guard to measure neuromuscular function have been increased However it is not yet accepted as a monitor of definitive studies of neuromuscular blocking agents in anesthesia probably because it does not register the neuromuscular function in a continuous fashion and can generate noise in the measurement of the effect 20 Previously we utilized it to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of rocuronium 6 28 When used for rocuronium data acquisition every 5 min in the recovery period was enough to model the recovery phase Because of a fast recovery after mivacurium administration data acquisition in the recovery phase was now performed every minute and the effect was also successfully modeled and results agreed with those previously published in the literature We therefore considered that if any the noise generated by TOF Guard measurements did not affect data modeling nor results and conclusions of the current study Unfortunately and despite its relative low cost capacity to retain data sets and its easy to use TOF Guard is worldwide no longer commercially available It is being replaced by the manufacturer company with equivalent equipment named the TOF Watch series written personal communication from Biometer International A S Odense Denmark 1999 unable to retain data and therefore require to be connected into a computer Finally we simultaneously registered T and T4 T1 It has been proposed that the T4 T1 is more sensitive than evaluation of any single twitch of the TOF response 29 30 and does not need an established control By evaluating the T response significantly faster OA times were identified with mivacurium 250 g kg while all the T1 T4 were similar between the two groups This controversy deserves further investigation Conclusions The maximal effect of mivacurium 250 g kg was produced one minute faster than 200 g kg However it was associated to a significant cardiovascular response We therefore conclude that the higher dose does not offer a satisfactory clinical advantage over the lower dose in infants under general anesthesia with isoflurane Abbreviations AUC HR AUC SBP and AUC DBP Respectively the area under the time course of heart rate systolic
