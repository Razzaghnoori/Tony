 Background Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness but its molecular etiology is poorly understood Glaucoma involves retinal ganglion cell death and optic nerve damage that is often associated with elevated intraocular pressure IOP 1 2 3 4 5 It is becoming increasingly clear that many forms of glaucoma have a genetic component 6 7 and much current research is focused on identifying chromosomal regions and genes that contribute to glaucoma 8 9 10 Identifying such loci allows screening for individuals with an increased risk of developing glaucoma 11 Identifying genes contributing to elevated IOP and glaucoma is only the first step however and animal models will provide systems for subsequent hypothesis testing and experimental dissection of pathogenesis Due to conservation in mammalian physiology and the powerful tools of mouse genetics mice are a very important experimental system for probing the functions both in health and disease of many genes recently identified by sequencing the human genome 12 We have focused on developing the mouse system for IOP and glaucoma studies 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Mice are expected to be extremely helpful in characterizing genes and mechanisms that affect IOP or the susceptibility of the optic nerve and retina to glaucomatous damage 20 Very little is known about the magnitude of IOP of various mouse strains or IOP fluctuation in mice with time or other factors Previously we developed a method to measure IOP in mice and reported initial findings on the magnitude of mouse IOP 13 The procedure involves direct measurement of pressure following cannulation of the anterior chamber The initial experiments demonstrated that in our hands careful ocular cannulation has a very minor effect on IOP average of 0 3 mmHg mode 0 5 mmHg and demonstrated significant differences in intraocular pressure levels between four mouse strains Here we provide an update including an extensive strain survey and show that the methodology is reliable and produces reproducible data over extended periods of time Results A broad range of IOPs between strains Figure 1shows the average IOP of a number of inbred mouse strains that were housed in the same environmental conditions There is a wide range of IOP with strain BALB cJ having one of the lowest average IOPs 11 1 0 5 mmHg and strain CBA CaJ one of the highest IOPs 19 3 0 3 mmHg Significant differences exist among various strains P 0 0001 for all groups ANOVA comparing strains within each sex group Clinical and histological analysis of the eyes of all studied strains see Table 1 did not identify anatomic or pathologic features that might account for the differences in IOP For example the iridocorneal angle and aqueous humor drainage structures are open to the anterior chamber and have normal morphology in both BALB cJ and CBA CaJ mice Figure 2 More than 20 of CBA CaJ mice had IOPs of over 21 mmHg which increases risk for glaucoma in humans We aged a small group of these mice n 4 to 2 years and histologically analyzed their optic nerves and retinas but they did not develop glaucoma Strain differences are reproducible To assess the consistency of IOP in specific strains we measured IOP in different cohorts of each strain maintained under similar conditions at different times We purposefully included strains at each end of the IOP spectrum and strain C57BL 6J B6 that is commonly used for genetic experiments Figure 3 The average IOP of different cohorts of strains CBA CaJ CBA CaHN both high end of spectrum and B6 were consistent over time This was true of most strains assessed on multiple occasions Average IOP for age matched mice of the same strain assessed at different times typically differed by no more than 1 5 mmHg and the differences were usually smaller Strain 129P3 J was the most variable strain with the average IOP fluctuating by up to 2 5 mmHg Despite the general consistency of IOP the average IOPs of some strains have changed in a reproducible manner The IOPs of BALB cJ mice low end of spectrum were very similar for the past several years around 11 mmHg Between early 1996 and 1997 however the IOP of this strain did jump from approximately 7 7 mmHg to approximately 11 mmHg Figure 3 During this period the room in which our animals were housed and the manufacturer of the mouse diet were changed Over the same period the IOP of A J also increased dramatically from 9 4 0 5 mmHg n 11 in 1996 to 14 2 0 4 mmHg n 19 in 1997 The increased IOP in A J also was reproducible with the average IOP of mice assessed in the year 2000 being 14 5 0 4 mmHg n 16 Importantly the IOPs of strains B6 and C3H HeJ did not change during this time B6 12 3 0 5 mmHg in 1996 and 12 4 0 3 mmHg in 1997 n 10 and 14 C3H HeJ 13 7 0 8 mmHg in 1996 and 13 6 0 2 mmHg in 1997 n 9 and 19 Effect of age on IOP We focused on the commonly used B6 129P3 J and C3H HeJ strains to determine the effects of age on IOP Figure 4 In B6 age had a significant effect on IOP P 0 001 IOP was slightly decreased at both 12 months 12 2 0 2 mmHg and 19 months 12 2 0 3 mmHg compared to 3 months 13 1 0 3 mmHg and 7 months 13 3 0 3 mmHg Although the decrease was of a similar level to the variation observed in 3 month old mice see Figure 3 the IOPs of control young mice see Methods analyzed at the same times as the various B6 age groups did not decrease For example control mice analyzed at the same time as the 3 month 12 month and 18 month B6 age groups had IOPs of 13 0 0 2 mmHg n 14 13 3 0 2 mmHg n 14 13 7 0 4 mmHg n 12 respectively IOP was even lower in the 24 month B6 mice 10 8 0 4 mmHg and again the average IOP of young controls measured at the same time was not changed 13 5 0 2 n 12 In strain 129P3 J IOP did not differ significantly with age between 3 and 14 months but was lower in 18 month old mice P 0 001 compared to all younger ages Figure 4 Despite a 1 mmHg dip in IOP at 8 months there were no significant IOP differences between C3H HeJ mice at each age tested P 0 2 for age Although the effect of age has not been thoroughly assessed in other strains no obvious age related differences have been identified in other strains analyzed at multiple ages except for the glaucomatous DBA 2J and AKXD 28 Ty strains 14 19 Effect of sex on IOP Although we have not rigorously assessed the effect of sex on IOP in many strains sex specific differences have not been detected in the majority of strains for which both sexes have been analyzed and have proven inconsistent even within an individual strain analyzed multiple times Strains B6 and 129P3 J have been extensively evaluated at multiple ages between 3 and 24 months of age Sex differences were always absent in strain 129P3 J and typically absent in strain B6 In strain B6 however males infrequently had significantly higher IOP than females For example in one experiment B6 males had an average IOP of 14 2 0 3 mmHg n 12 whereas the average IOP of females was 13 1 0 3 mmHg n 12 P 0 01 If real this sporadic sex difference was not dependent on age sometimes occurring in a group of B6 mice at a particular age and sometimes not occurring in a separate group of the same age Anesthesia protocol avoids IOP alteration and allows detection of diurnal differences All IOPs were assessed using an anesthetic regime of 99 mg kg ketamine and 9 mg kg xylazine defined as 1X Initial experiments suggested that an almost identical dose 100 mg kg ketamine and 9 mg kg xylazine of anesthesia had no effect on IOP during the experimental period with IOP being measured as soon as possible after the mouse was unconscious typically minutes 13 To further assess the effects of anesthesia we measured IOP in groups of genetically identical B6 mice subjected to different doses 1X 1 5X and 2X at 5 and 25 minutes after administration Figure 5 For all doses IOP decreased by 25 minutes P 0 005 for time The greater the dose the greater the decrease in IOP At the 5 minute measurement however IOP was the same using all doses suggesting that the anesthetic effect on IOP had not yet occurred To identify any early window when it may be possible to assess IOP without an obvious anesthetic effect 195 mice of strain B6 were anesthetized with the 1X dose and IOP was measured at 1 minute time points between 4 and 12 minutes after administration Figure 5 The mean IOP of groups analyzed at each time point did not differ P 0 9 indicating that the IOP depressing effect of anesthesia occurs later than 12 minutes after administration Similar results were obtained using 161 strain 129P3 J and 145 strain DBA 2J mice with the 1X dose 129P3 J P 0 1 DBA 2J P 0 2 In support of a later effect of anesthesia since general anesthesia is reported to mask diurnal variation in IOP 21 we identified increased IOP during the dark compared to the light period of the day in several tested strains Figure 6 In these experiments IOP measurements were made between 5 and 12 minutes after administration of anesthesia Blood pressure does not correlate with IOP An initial study of the relationship between blood pressure and IOP in mice did not detect a good correlation R 2 0 1 Figure 7 Myocalleles do not associate with the magnitude of IOP Mutations in the myocilin gene MYOC cause human glaucoma To determine if allelic variation in the mouse Myoc gene associated with IOP in mouse strains we analyzed the gene in an assortment of strains with different IOPs Two alleles were identified One of these alleles had a 12 nucleotide insertion in the promoter region ccagagcagggt between positions 340 and 341 compared to the previously published sequence and is called the insertion allele The other allele was identical to the published sequence 22 The insertion allele also had a previously reported substitution A to G Thr164Ala in exon 1 and several other single base changes in the promoter region 22 The presence or absence of this allele does not associate with IOP as it is present in strains with a range of IOPs Figure 8 Genetic alterations and IOP Y Chromosome The Y chromosome has been implicated in strain specific blood pressure differences in rats 23 24 To test if the Y chromosome of strain 129 Ola alters IOP in relation to that of strain B6 we compared the IOPs of pure B6 males and consomic B6 males that had the 129P2 Ola Y chromosome backcrossed for 11 generations No differences in IOP were detected between these groups of mice Figure 9 P 0 1 Car2 To test if deficiency of carbonic anhydrase II leads to decreased IOP we analyzed mice of a B6 background that were genetically similar but with normal or mutant alleles of the Car2 gene 25 26 There was no difference in IOP between normal and mutant mice Figure 9 P 0 5 Lepr To test if genetic perturbations that cause obesity and diabetes can alter IOP we compared mice that were genetically similar but were either homozygous or heterozygous for a leptin receptor mutation db that results in obesity and diabetes before 4 months of age on the C57BLKS J strain background used 27 IOP was modestly but significantly elevated in obese diabetic homozygous mutants 14 7 0 3 mmHg compared to non obese non diabetic heterozygotes 13 4 0 4 mmHg P 0 01 Figure 9 Tyr To determine if albinism alters IOP we analyzed B6 mice that were either pigmented or albino The albino mice were homozygous and coisogenic for a mutant allele of tyrosinase Tyr c 2 J that arose on the otherwise pigmented B6 background In 2 month old mice homozygosity for Tyr c 2 J resulted in increased IOP 14 2 0 4 mmHg compared to wild type pigmented mice 12 4 0 3 mmHg P 0 0001 The same was true for independent cohorts of mice of different ages that were analyzed at different times Figure 10A In contrast to pigmented B6 mice Figure 6 the IOPs of the albino B6 mice were not increased at measurement during the dark compared to light period of the day P 0 6 Figure 10B Discussion IOP differences are reproducible and amenable to genetic analyses We report the IOPs of over 30 genetically different mouse strains that were housed in the same environmental conditions The magnitude of IOP differences between strains and the good reproducibility of readings over time will allow the use of genetic approaches to identify genes that underlie these differences Using our method a trained investigator can measure the IOPs of 10 mice in an hour Thus it is feasible to assess sufficient numbers of mice for quantitative trait locus QTL analysis methods and to use these methods to identify chromosomal regions contributing to strain differences in IOP The strain survey we report provides valuable information for designing these experiments The throughput and reproducibility also is sufficient for mutagenesis screens 28 29 30 These are important approaches as they may allow the association of genes with IOP and glaucoma whose currently known functions do not suggest that they affect aqueous humor dynamics or do not immediately identify them as likely glaucoma candidates No effect of anesthetic protocol on IOP during a 12 minute measurement window Similarities and differences to rat studies Our results agree with the time course of cardiovascular depression caused by intraperitoneal administration of ketamine and xylazine in rats In that study anesthesia had a minor effect on blood pressure during the first 15 minutes following injection but a strong hypotensive effect between 15 and 30 minutes that continued for more than an hour 35 In contrast intraperitoneally administered ketamine 100 mg kg was shown to rapidly decrease IOP in a different rat study 36 IOP decreased significantly between a conscious measurement and the first possible measurement under anesthesia defined as time 0 IOP decreased further by the next reading at 5 minutes after which it remained stable for the duration of the experiment 20 minutes 36 The time 0 measurement in that study was at a very similar state of anesthesia as our 4 and 5 minute time points starting as soon as possible and within 20 to 60 seconds of adequate anesthesia and the 5 minute rat time point was similar to our 9 and 10 minute measurement times Thus although both rat and mouse studies show that anesthesia decreases IOP the studies do not agree on the timing of the effect The IOP depression occurred very soon after anesthesia in the rats but was delayed in the mice Environment may influence the effect of anesthesia Factors that may influence the effect of anesthesia include the species strain and environment used Essentially the same dose of ketamine and route of administration was used in both the rat and mouse IOP studies In mice the strain does not appear to be important as no early effect of anesthesia was present in the three distantly related laboratory strains 37 we studied in detail and we have not observed any obvious effect during this period in any analyzed strain Environmental differences may be important Cage cleanliness changing frequency and housing density can alter drug metabolism and the effect of anesthesia in rats 38 39 The type of bedding used also may be important We use wood shavings for bedding and wood shavings expose the mice to terpenes Terpene administration or environmental exposure to terpenes in wood shavings alters drug resistance and decreases the effect of anesthetic agents in both rats and mice 40 41 42 43 44 45 Risk factors for increased IOP Age Although within the range of variability observed in young mice the IOP of B6 mice modestly decreased around 1 year of age This decrease was statistically significant compared to young mice measured at the same time At 2 years of age the IOP of B6 mice had decreased further though an effect of anesthesia in these very old mice cannot be ruled out 49 The IOP of 129P3 J mice also decreased with age but only at the oldest age examined 18 months Decreasing IOP correlates with increasing age in the human Japanese population 50 51 Further studies of B6 mice may allow experimental investigation of this effect Additional studies may also identify normal mouse strains that develop increased IOP with age as generally occurs in Western populations 52 53 We previously demonstrated that the glaucomatous strains DBA 2J and AKXD 28 Ty develop elevated IOP with age 14 19 Gender In the examined strains we found no consistent differences in IOP between males and females This was true at all ages for the 3 strains that were aged to 18 months or older This is in agreement with a number of human studies which show that IOP is equal between the sexes 52 53 However some studies have found sex specific differences typically with higher IOP in females and the magnitude of the difference increasing after 40 years of age 53 54 Of possible relevance we previously reported that female mice of strains DBA 2J and AKXD 28 Ty develop elevated IOP at an earlier age than males 14 19 Blood pressure Some but not all human studies have reported a positive association between IOP and blood pressure 48 52 Our comparison of the relationship between blood pressure and IOP in young adult female mice of different mouse strains whose blood pressures differed up to 36 mmHg did not reveal a positive correlation Further studies are needed to determine if blood pressure correlates with IOP in males and to determine the relationship between blood pressure and IOP in various mouse strains with age Obesity and diabetes Obesity or higher body mass index have been implicated by some but not other studies as risk factors for increased IOP and glaucoma 51 55 56 57 Similarly diabetes or the combination of diabetes and obesity have been variably associated with elevated IOP and glaucoma 46 52 58 59 60 61 62 To test if genetic perturbations that cause obesity and diabetes can alter IOP we compared groups of mice that were genetically similar except that they were either homozygous or heterozygous for a leptin receptor mutation db that results in early onset obesity and diabetes The obese diabetic mice had higher IOPs than their lean non diabetic littermates Thus epidemiological associations between increased IOP and obesity or diabetes are supported by this work and appear to be functionally relevant Further experiments with obese non diabetic or diabetic non obese mice will help to characterize the separate effects of these risk factors IOP is increased during the dark period of the day Diurnal variation in IOP is common in humans and laboratory animals 53 The molecular mechanisms underlying the diurnal rhythm are not defined but increased aqueous humor production or flow occurs during the period of increased IOP in both rabbits and humans 63 64 65 Small changes in the resistance to aqueous humor drainage may also contribute to diurnal differences in IOP 66 67 We first suspected IOP changes with time of day when the IOP of a group of B6 mice measured in the hour prior to onset of the dark period appeared to be higher than at other times of day Previously a rise of IOP was reported to occur before onset of the dark period in rats 21 and rats and rabbits were shown to have higher IOP during the dark period compared to the light period 21 68 69 Thus we compared the IOPs of mice at different times of day and identified several strains with significantly higher IOP during the dark compared to the light period The magnitude of the difference varies with strain and was greatest in SWR J The IOP increase in the dark is not dependent on functional rod and cone photoreceptors since these cells degenerate in SWR J mice due to homozygosity for the Pde6b rd 1mutation In agreement with this finding circadian regulation of wheel running by light was previously reported in mice lacking rods and cones 70 Interestingly the IOP of strain CBA CaJ which has one of the highest daytime IOPs does not appear to increase in the dark Further more detailed studies are needed to define the characteristics of the diurnal rhythm of intraocular pressure in mice and to determine whether it is lacking or has a different timing in strain CBA CaJ Analysis of these mouse strains may increase understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling diurnal rhythms of IOP and that may be relevant to glaucoma Car2deficiency does not alter IOP Bicarbonate formation is important for aqueous humor secretion from the ciliary processes and carbonic anhydrase CA facilitates this secretion There are multiple forms of CA and the CAII isoform is reported to be the predominant form in the ciliary processes 71 72 Our experiments show that a genetic deficiency of CAII in mice homozygous for a mutation in the Car2 gene does not alter IOP CAIV activity was recently demonstrated in the ciliary processes 73 and so our data may support a more substantial role for CAIV compared to CAII in aqueous humor secretion It also is possible that CAII substantially contributes to aqueous humor secretion but that functional mouse CAIV is sufficient to prevent an effect of CAII deficiency on IOP in Car2 mutant mice In support of a role for both enzymes a greater than 90 inhibition of CA is required for significant reduction of aqueous secretion 71 72 Tyrosinase deficiency results in increased IOP Tyrosinase is the first enzyme of the pigment production pathway Tyrosinase deficiency causes albinism and has various ocular consequences These include alteration of the number of ipsilaterally projecting retinal axons and substantially increased light penetration past the iris 74 It is not known if these abnormalities affect mammalian IOP Here we show increased IOP in mice lacking tyrosinase activity compared to otherwise genetically identical pigmented B6 mice Additionally IOP differences between the light and dark period of the day were detected in the pigmented but not the albino B6 mice Thus albinism can affect the diurnal pattern of IOP changes In agreement with this result mice with albino eyes that are homozygous for tyrosinase or pink eye dilution mutations have altered diurnal rhythms compared to pigmented mice 75 Albinism by itself is either not sufficient to alter the diurnal rhythm of IOP or alters it in different ways depending upon genetic background however since the albino strains BALB cByJ and SWR J had increased IOP during the dark Diurnal rhythms are known to depend on visual pathways and to respond to light intensity Exposing rats to 24 hours of low light abrogates the diurnal fluctuation of IOP and results in constantly elevated IOP 36 Further experiments will determine the nature of the diurnal rhythm of IOP in the albino B6 mice and if its alteration or other mechanisms result in IOP elevation Conclusions A broad range of reproducible IOP differences exists between inbred mouse strains and a diurnal rhythm of IOP exists in different strains Various factors have been variably associated with risk for increased IOP in humans Genetically uniform mice can be used to study the effects of these risk factors on IOP In trained hands our measurement procedure is reliable accurate and rapid enough to allow large scale genetic studies of factors determining IOP Mice have great potential for helping to characterize the molecular mechanisms affecting IOP Materials and Methods Animal husbandry All experiments were performed in compliance with the ARVO statement for use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research All mice were bred and maintained at The Jackson Laboratory Mice were housed in cages containing white pine bedding and covered with polyester filters For most experiments the mice were fed NIH31 6 fat chow ad libitum and their water was acidified to pH 2 8 to 3 2 B6 mice develop diet induced diabetes when maintained on a high fat diet 76 To ensure that we were analyzing the effect of age and not diabetes the B6 mice in the aging experiment were fed NIH31 4 fat chow We have found no differences in IOP between B6 mice housed on the 4 fat and 6 fat versions of this otherwise identical diet The mice were group housed and the cages were changed one time per week If any cage appeared soiled between scheduled changes the mice were placed in a clean cage The environment was kept at 21 C with a 14 hour light 10 hour dark cycle The colony was monitored for specific pathogens by The Jackson Laboratory s routine surveillance program see http www jax orgfor specific pathogens Intraocular pressure Intraocular pressures were measured as described elsewhere 13 77 The mice were typically acclimatized to the procedure room for at least 2 weeks prior to measurement but sometimes between 1 and 2 weeks Although it was not possible to include all strains in each measurement period mice of different strains were intermixed As demonstrated here the IOPs of C57BL 6J are very consistent over time and so these animals were interspersed with experimental mice during all experiments to ensure that calibration had not drifted and that the system was functioning optimally Whenever possible the investigator measuring IOP did not know the genotypes of the animals It was not possible to analyze all age groups of each strain at the same time in the aging experiments Therefore to control for potential IOP changes due to measurement time and not age approximately 3 month old B6 mice were assessed at the same time as each age group All dark period measurements were made between 1 and 3 hours after the lights turned off The room was equipped with dim red lights and mice were protected from all light exposure during set up Each mouse was briefly exposed to the red light when the anesthetic agents were administered When adequate anesthesia was achieved after 3 to 4 minutes the mouse was placed on the measurement platform and the white light of the microscope was turned on for approximately 1 and a half minutes to allow ocular cannulation IOP measurement and post measurement tests 13 that guard against artifactual data The white light was used at very low intensity and was dim but we cannot rule out the possibility that this brief exposure altered the IOP All other mice were protected from light exposure throughout the time an individual mouse was analyzed Blood pressure The blood pressures of conscious mice of each strain 6 to 12 females per strain were measured with a tail cuff system as reported 78 except that 5 days of training were used The mice were analyzed in the same procedure room as was used for IOP measurment Clinical examinations For most strains anterior chambers were examined with a slit lamp biomicroscope 16 At least 8 mice of each strain shown in figure 1were evaluated However the anterior chambers of C57BLKS J mice were only evaluated under a dissection microscope at the time of IOP measurement Histological analysis Eyes from at least 2 mice of the listed strains were fixed 4 paraformaldehyde or Fekete s acid alcohol formalin fixative processed paraffin embedded and sectioned as previously reported 15 79 except that the paraformaldehyde was buffered with 0 1 M phosphate buffer All strains other than CBA CaHN and C57BLKS J strains were evaluated The eyes of CBA CaJ and BALB cJ mice were also fixed and processed for plastic embedding Historesin Leica Heidelberg Germany and sectioned as previously reported 14 79 Saggital sections including the pupil and optic nerve were collected and analyzed as they contain most ocular structures Analysis of Myoc Exons and the proximal promoter of the mouse Myoc gene were amplified
