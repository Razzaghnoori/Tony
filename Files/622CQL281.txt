 Keepers of the Lore story tellink net Last Sunday June 18th the rain came and severely curtailed attendance at this year s Keepers of the Lore Joseph Campbell Festival of Myth Folklore and Story Suddenly our non profit organization has been confronted with a 5 000 deficit with no other financial resources to draw upon Without financial assistance some of our performers and suppliers may not be paid And everyone will have to take far less than we agreed upon This situation could also impact our ability to mount another festival next year That s why I m turning to friends like you for help You already understand the importance of storytelling poetry song and theatre in fostering empathy compassion and the imagination And you probably also have a keen appreciation for the role of the oral tradition in bringing people together from diverse cultures nationalities and religions bridging the gap between our differences and helping to foster peace instead of conflict and misunderstanding This is what it means to keep the wisdom lore alive and right now we need your help to do it A donation of any amount would be deeply appreciated Or perhaps you know of someone else who shares these same values who might be willing to help Please if you can send your tax deductible donation to Keepers of the Lore P O Box 453 Milford NH 03055 If you would like to speak with me directly with any questions or suggestions please call 603 654 5944 or send an email to story tellink net If you would like to introduce our work to anyone who might be interested in helping us during this financial crisis I am readily available to speak with him or her by phone or in person Please give me a call so that we can discuss Help us keep the wisdom lore alive Your gift of any amount will be greatly appreciated I hope to hear from you soon Paul Nelson Executive Director KEEPERS OF THE LORE
