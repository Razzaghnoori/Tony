 Adam s Curse By William Butler Yeats 1865 1939 posted Wednesday Jan 14 To hear Robert Pinsky read Adam s Curse click In Adam s Curse Yeats writes in apparently effortless couplets demonstrating what he says about writing what is demanding is made to look natural and easy The conversation in his poem is so convincingly real yet the poetry so gorgeous in its sounds that I always feel a little shocked to realize how sad the resolution actually is Yet the sweep and grace to include so much of love and art and life in such a small space with such a beguilingly intimate surface temper the sadness a lot Robert Pinsky We sat together at one summer s end That beautiful mild woman your close friend And you and I and talked of poetry I said A line will take us hours maybe Yet if it does not seem a moment s thought Our stitching and unstitching has been naught Better go down upon your marrow bonesAnd scrub a kitchen pavement or break stonesLike an old pauper in all kinds of weather For to articulate sweet sounds togetherIs to work harder than all these and yetBe thought an idler by the noisy setOf bankers schoolmasters and clergymenThe martyrs call the world And thereuponThat beautiful mild woman for whose sakeThere s many a one shall find out all heartacheOn finding that her voice is sweet and lowReplied To be born woman is to know Although they do not talk of it at school That we must labour to be beautiful I said It s certain there is no fine thingSince Adam s fall but needs much labouring There have been lovers who thought love should beSo much compounded of high courtesyThat they would sigh and quote with learned looksPrecedents out of beautiful old books Yet now it seems an idle trade enough We sat grown quiet at the name of love We saw the last embers of daylight die And in the trembling blue green of the skyA moon worn as if it had been a shellWashed by time s waters as they rose and fellAbout the stars and broke in days and years I had a thought for no one s but your ears That you were beautiful and that I stroveTo love you in the old high way of love That it had all seemed happy and yet we d grownAs weary hearted as that hollow moon
