 Experimental psychologists working with humans have a fundamental advantage over scientists studying the behaviour of other animals This is because human subjects can give a verbal account of their experience For example they can report These two lights of different colour look equally bright or This object looks further away than that one Such direct reports facilitate studying how information from the sensory periphery that is the sense organs that actually interface with the environment is processed in the brain The perceptual world of animals is often very different from that of humans Many animals have sensory facilities that we humans lack for example insects can see ultraviolet and polarised light But how they actually perceive the world based on information from their sensory periphery is often beyond our grasp Because animals cannot describe their sensations our access to them is often based on indirect psychophysical tests where animal performance depends fundamentally on motivation and training method Chittka et al 2003 However some animals do in fact describe the world around them but not necessarily in ways that we might intuitively understand Perhaps the best example of this are the honeybees genus Apis which have a symbolic language that nestmates use to communicate with each other about profitable food sources By eavesdropping on this communication scientists have recently obtained a unique perspective into the perceptual world of insects How does the dance language work A triumphant scout bee returns from the field and advertises the location of a newly discovered food source to nestmates To do this the forager performs a repetitive sequence of movements the so called waggle dance which is one of the most intriguing examples of complex animal behaviour The successful forager wiggles her abdomen provocatively from side to side moving forward in a straight line Then she runs in a half circle to the left back to her starting point performs another straight wiggle run along the path of her first and then circles to the right Figure 1 This pattern is repeated multiple times and is eagerly attended by unemployed bees in the hive Shortly after such dances commence dozens of newly recruited foragers arrive at the food source being advertised In the 1940s Nobel laureate Karl von Frisch deciphered the code hidden in this seemingly senseless choreography performed on vertical honeycombs in the darkness of the hive reviewed in von Frisch 1967 He found that the angle of the waggle run from the vertical is equal to the angle between the sun s azimuth and the indicated food source outside the hive For example if a food source is found in the direction of the sun the dancer will waggle straight up the vertical comb If food is found 45 to the right of the sun s direction the waggle run will be oriented 45 to the right of vertical on the comb Figure 1 The distance to the target a flower patch with abundant nectar or pollen is encoded in the duration of the waggle run the longer the bee waggles the larger the distance of the food from the hive No other species besides humans uses a similarly symbolic representation to communicate information from the real world But how do bees measure the flight distance that they communicate so precisely It was previously thought they do this by measuring the energy used as they fly Heran 1956 However doubts emerged when it was found that distance estimation by bees could be manipulated by altering the number of landmarks between the hive and a food source suggesting bees were counting landmarks encountered en route Chittka and Geiger 1995 In an elegant experiment Esch and Burns 1995 tapped into the bees dance language to access their subjective assessment of flight distance They let bees forage from a food source 70 m from the hive and recorded the dance distance code of the returning foragers Subsequently the feeder was attached to a weather balloon and slowly lifted to an altitude of 90 m so that the distance between the hive and the food now increased from 70 m to 114 m Correspondingly foragers should have indicated a longer distance by stretching their waggle run duration But in fact the perceived distance as indicated in the dance decreased by more than 50 This clearly shows that bee perception of distance cannot solely be based on energy expenditure since a longer flight that cost more energy was danced as a shorter distance in the waggle run So what actually drives the bee odometer Because the landscape bees pass in flight moves more slowly when bees fly at higher altitudes Esch and Burns 1995 conjectured that foragers process the speed with which visual contours move across the eye optic flow and integrate this with travel time To confirm this hypothesis Srinivasan et al 2000 further exaggerated the experienced image flow by training bees to fly through narrow chequered tunnels These bees grossly overestimated actual travel distance bragging to their nestmates that they had flown 195 m when in fact they had flown 6 m Attendees of these dances promptly believed the high class swindle and searched for food at remote locations that the dancers had never even visited Esch et al 2001 The quality of information available about the velocity of the passing landscape will depend of course on the sensitivity of the eyes The eyes of bees contain three types of colour receptors with maximum sensitivity in the ultraviolet blue and green domains of the spectrum Autrum and von Zwehl 1964 Their excellent colour vision is optimal for flower identification Chittka 1996 but do they also use it to measure the image velocity of the passing landscape Surprisingly the answer is no bee odometry is in fact totally colour blind Chittka and Tautz 2003 found that bees use exclusively the signal from their green receptors for measuring image velocity Figure 2 confirming earlier reports that motion vision in bees is mediated only by this receptor type Giurfa and Lehrer 2001 Spaethe et al 2001 Thus the level of intensity contrast present in the scene strongly influences the bees subjective experience of flight distance Chittka and Tautz 2003 Si et al 2003 With so many external variables influencing distance estimation it seems unlikely that the honeybee odometer would be very robust in natural conditions Now as reported in this issue of PLoS Biology Tautz et al 2004 have quantified the bees subjective experience of distance travelled when they fly over natural terrain with varying levels of contrast Specifically they compared the dances of bees flying over water scenery with low visual contrast with those of bees flying over land scenery with relatively high contrast They trained bees to forage at a feeder on a boat which was paddled increasing distances from the hive until it reached an island All the while observers at the hive deciphered the dances of the bees returning from the feeder Interestingly bees flying 200 m over water hardly appeared to register an increase in travel distance whereas the same increase in distance flown over land resulted in a substantial increase in perceived flight distance This is consistent with the hypothesis that the bees odometer is largely based on visual external cues and demonstrates that this system is sensitive to visual contrast But there must be something else beside visual cues Navigation over water in the near absence of visible ground features is extremely difficult without a reliable internal instrument measuring travel speed This is the case even for us humans with sophisticated measuring devices malfunctioning air speed indicators have been responsible for several airplane crashes into water for example Birgenair Flight 301 and AeroPeru Flight 603 in 1996 Heran and Lindauer 1963 likewise observed that honeybees flying over lakes sometimes lost altitude and plunged into the water However the new study by Tautz et al 2004 also shows that most bees will reliably fly over prolonged stretches of water without accident Furthermore even though bees experience only a small increase in subjective travel distance when flying over water it is not zero This indicates that bees do perhaps resort to an internal measure of flight distance when other cues fail For example bumblebees walking to a food source in absolute darkness that is in the complete absence of visual cues are able to correctly gauge travel distance Chittka et al 1999 indicating that an internal odometer possibly based on energy consumption also exists It appears that animal navigation just like aviation relies on multiple backup systems that support each other and can compensate if one system fails in a certain context Spying on honeybee dances can not only tell us about the cues they use for navigation but also allows insights into the cognitive architecture that governs other aspects of bee behaviour such as the assessment of flower quality We ve learned that bees prefer high over low nectar concentrations because this is reflected in their dances When bees find better nectar they dance more enthusiastically that is the number of dance circuits per minute increases Seeley et al 2000 Waddington 2001 However Waddington 2001 found that the relationship between actual and perceived nectar quality is nonlinear In fact it is a positive but decelerating relationship so that an increase in sucrose concentration from 10 to 20 results in twice the difference in dance rate that an increase from 50 to 60 does Interestingly the perceived change in quality is stronger when there is a decrease than when there is an increase in nectar quality of the same magnitude Such asymmetric perception of gains and losses is well known in humans where it has been linked to risk aversive behaviour Tversky and Kahnemann 1981 Unfortunately animal subjects often do not yield this type of information very readily Only in their own language do they reveal many of their perceptual peculiarities Using the bee language as a window into insect visual perception has been a wonderful tool and is a promising avenue for further research into the question of how miniature brains encode the world around them
