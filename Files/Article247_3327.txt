 All Action and No Talk Dear Jodi Washington may be the spawning ground of talking heads and the prime target of right wing talk radio but when it comes to magazines D C remains a no talking zone Wandering the streets of this provincial backwater I discovered yet again that Washington is all action and no Talk Not a copy of the Tina Brown doorstop has arrived at any newsstand I checked Maybe tomorrow said the only news vendor who had even heard of it So about all I can do is wonder if Harrison Ford s weary stare would have been as weary if he reversed his word order and intoned Success is the pox of celebrity Or maybe Celebrity interviews are the pox of glossy magazine journalism Jodi is it possible that we re all supposed to return from our hard adventure exploits with scabby knees A full body cast seems more probable but that s one way to combine today s Wall Street Journal with Talk s Hip List Seriously I think the dirty secret that helps explain the upsurge in adventure travel and other forms of risk taking is that Americans are bored with prosperity Where is the grand adventure in politics when the only choices on the table in Washington are an unneeded tax cut or squirreling the surplus away for baby boomers golden years What s the point of getting rich and flaunting your wealth through conspicuous consumption if everybody on your block is collecting vintage wines and building oversize vacation homes Nantucket according to Sunday s Times is fast being despoiled by parvenus who are tearing down historic houses and replacing them with soulless mansions because of loopholes in the local zoning laws Of course as a recent summer renter on Martha s Vineyard I represent a classic case of the raise the drawbridge we re here syndrome In short who wouldn t crave a little adventure in their lives at a time when the political leaders of both parties are hellbent on giving us a yawn inducing electoral choice between Al Gore and George W Bush Which of course brings us back to Ron Klain s departure from the Gore White House staff A major reason the Gore campaign is so garrulous is that they are top heavy with armchair generals who want to retain their credibility with the press in case the vice president loses A parlor game among political journalists these days is to see how many of Gore s half dozen communications directors you can name In contrast the lean and hungry Bill Bradley campaign managed to keep the biggest secret of all last December Dollar Bill s surprise entry into the presidential race One last nugget for the afternoon comes from Lloyd Grove s Reliable Source column in the Washington Post Bush it seems has become an Austin Powers fanatic enlivening his contentless campaign travels with dead on imitations of Dr Evil But according to campaign spokesman Mindy Tucker the Texas governor is more partial to Mini Me than to Dr Evil How fitting that Bush the Younger so deeply identifies with the pint size offspring of an illustrious father Happily yielding to you for the final word I am already salivating over tomorrow s breakfast
