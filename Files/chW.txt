 Water Spirits See Chanes Wedding Customs Chicano wedding rituals vary from state to state in the Southwest and the Midwest often incorporating emerging American customs but there are still common traditions that originate with Catholicism and the Spanish heritage that are shared from community to community The Spanish word for a wedding is boda meaning nuptials and often Chicanos will call a wedding celebration La Boda The southwestern region with the most researched and documented wedding customs is New Mexico because the descendents of the early Hispanos have been conscious of describing and writing down their traditions For instance Fabiola Cabeza de Baca Cleofas Jaramillo and Nina Otero all wrote about the weddings of northern New Mexico In her book The Good Life Fabiola Cabeza de Baca has a brief chapter on wedding traditions including recipes and a detailed description of the preparation of the food When a couple married three main ceremonies took place These were initiated after the groom and his family had asked the girl s family for her hand in marriage If the girl or her family refused the offer she would send a letter to her suitor with her negative response This was termed as giving cala bazas squash or pumpkin and was a great insult to the wooer Of the ceremonies first there was el d a del prendorio day of the engagement when the bride and groom came together publicly for the first time A great celebration would take place usually in the home of the bride with food drinks and music This festivity would be equivalent to an engagement party The day of the wedding was called el d a del casorio and could last from two to three days The upper classes held lavish wedding ceremonies that would last for days with lots of music and food for their many guests the poorer folks also followed many of the same traditions although in a more modest fashion It was the tradition that the bridegroom s family hosted the celebration after the church service There was always an orchestra that played while the guests ate and a big dance on the eve of the wedding day After the dance or at the conclusion of the feast there was the entrega de novios delivery of the wedding couple when the wedding couple was formally returned to their parents and placed under their guidance Songs from this ritual were collected by Juan Rael and reveal the solemnity of the ceremony The Hispano folklore does not specify the actual religious sacramental rituals but more recent publications do describe church ceremonies that are still observed today In very traditional weddings the arras thirteen coins or pieces of silver are given by the groom to his bride as a symbol of security After the wedding vows are stated during the Mass a lazo a cord with two connected loops is draped over the couple to symbolize the union of bride and groom Just before the couple leaves the church the bride or sometimes a designated child will pay tribute to La Virgen de Guadalupe by placing flowers at the foot of her statue or picture There are always lots of padrinos godfathers and madrinas godmothers bridegrooms and bridesmaids and of course Mariachi music

American folklore and Chicano studies With His Pistol in His Hand A Border Ballad and Its Hero published in 1958 by the University of Texas Press is not only one of the most important academic works on the history of the Chicano but it is also respected as major scholarship in the field of folklore studies and specifically on the genre of the ballad It is a study of a border ballad El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez which looks at the history of the Texas Mexican border and the life of Gregorio Cortez and presents an analysis of the man as a ballad hero As stated by Paredes himself in the introduction It is an account of the life of a man of the way that songs and legends grew up about his name and of the people who produced the songs the legends and the man 1958 1 It was in this work that Paredes proposed his theory of the production of Chicano folklore and especially the border ballad as a result of a process of border conflict generated by the invasion of Anglo culture and values into the Texas region in the early nineteenth century The balladry of the Rio Grande border was one of resistance against outside encroachment 1958 244 There was an inner need for the people to compose ballads that sang of the deeds of a man standing up for his rights who in the process is transformed into a hero Often the man is nonviolent but is coerced through persecution or abuse into killing his enemy often a Texas Ranger and must escape to the border His defeat is assured often he is killed or captured But whatever his fate he has stood up for his right 149 When the book was published it caused quite a stir in Texas because of its negative portrayal of the Texas Rangers The chief editor at the University of Texas Press asked Paredes to delete his critical references to Walter Prescott Webb J Frank Dobie and the Texas Rangers The book was eventually published in spite of his refusal to make any changes The timing of its publication was crucial in 1958 for its powerful influence on Chicano students and intellectuals since it came out just before the start of the Chicano movement of the 1960s Its intellectual and political impact on a whole generation of Chicano scholars cannot be overstated Almost all publications on Chicanos and Mexicanos up to that date had been written by Anglo American sociologists or anthropologists and the few published Hispano scholars such as Aurelio Espinosa and Arthur Campa were only known within a narrow circle of folklore specialists Gregorio Cortez the border hero and Am rico Paredes the scholar hero both became figures that young Chicano students could respect and emulate See also El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez Corridos Paredes Am rico Los Rinches References Lim n 1980a 1986 1990 1992 Paredes 1958
