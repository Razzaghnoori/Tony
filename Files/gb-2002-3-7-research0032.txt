 Background Androgens are central to sexual differentiation and the maintenance of male secondary sexual characteristics and functions Individuals with inactivating mutations of their androgen receptor AR androgen insensitivity syndromes AIS are phenotypically female in appearance and behavior and lack male sex accessory organs prostate seminal vesicles and Cowper s glands despite the presence of testes high levels of testosterone and a Y chromosome 1 The effects of androgens are cell specific and developmental stage specific For instance castration of an adult male does not change the external genitalia or voice pitch but causes a profound involution of the prostate particularly in the epithelial compartment 2 3 The exquisite sensitivity of prostatic epithelial cells to androgens has been exploited therapeutically in the management of prostate cancer 4 The mechanisms underlying the temporal and tissue specific effects of androgens are not understood Like all steroid hormones androgens act by binding to a nuclear hormone receptor enacting conformational changes that allow binding of the receptor to specific regulatory elements in AR responsive genes The ensuing cascade of transcriptional events unique to each cell type underlies the dramatic and diverse effects of androgen Understanding the molecular programs regulated by androgens in critical target tissues may lead to improvements in treatment of AIS in children benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer in adult men and diverse other conditions in which androgens play a key role Unfortunately few model systems are available for studying the effects of androgens in human tissues There are no practical models of early development when androgen exerts its most striking effects on the genitalia body habitus and brain Only a handful of immortalized cell lines express AR and respond to its ligands All of these cell lines have been isolated from patients with advanced prostate carcinomas that have become refractory to androgen deprivation therapy 5 6 7 In three of these cell lines LNCaP MDA PCa 2a and MDA PCa 2b mutations in the ligand binding domain of the AR confer broad steroid binding affinity 8 9 A fourth cell line LAPC 4 bears a wild type AR As an initial foray into understanding androgen mediated gene regulation we used cDNA microarrays to characterize the transcriptional program activated by the synthetic androgen R1881 in these four human prostate cancer cell lines The results provide a broad overview of characterized and uncharacterized genes modulated by androgens and identify many previously unknown androgen targets The similarity of the transcriptional responses among the four androgen responsive cell lines suggests that this expression program may be intrinsic to prostatic epithelial cell function Indeed most of the functionally characterized genes induced by androgen in these prostatic cells appear to have important roles in the production of seminal fluid Results and discussion In our initial experiments we focused exclusively on the well characterized LNCaP human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP cells were cultured in conditions of androgen deprivation for 48 hours then exposed to 1 nM of the synthetic androgen R1881 or to ethanol control 0 01 After treatment for intervals varying from 8 to 72 hours poly A RNA was extracted from the cells and analyzed using DNA microarrays Two types of array analyses were performed In the first mRNA from each sample of treated or control cells was reverse transcribed to produce Cys labeled cDNA and this was compared to a common reference of Cy3 labeled cDNA prepared from mRNA extracted from several cell lines 10 These experiments revealed changes in expression of several hundred genes in the R1881 treated LNCaP cells but no corresponding alterations in the ethanol treated control data not shown As the ethanol control treatment did not appear to affect gene expression significantly we analyzed another similar R1881 time course in which cDNAs representing transcripts from treated Cy 5 labeled and control Cy 3 labeled cells were compared directly by hybridization to the same microarrays Measured changes in gene expression patterns were virtually identical to those observed in the first experiment The remaining experiments were carried out using the direct comparative hybridization design The significance analysis of microarrays SAM procedure was used to identify genes with statistically significant changes in expression after treatment with R1881 The SAM procedure accurately identifies transcripts with reproducible changes in gene expression and is more reliable than conventional means of analyzing microarrays 11 Hierarchical clustering of the expression patterns of 567 transcripts representing 517 unique genes with statistically significant changes in expression in response to 1 nM R1881 in LNCaP is displayed in Figure 1a Expression levels changed more than twofold in 539 95 of the transcripts The raw microarray data and full details including transcript identities can be found at 12 Approximately one third of these transcripts represent uncharacterized and unnamed genes and were not previously known to be regulated by androgen Of the named genes many have not been previously recognized as responsive to androgen Virtually all of the known androgen regulated genes that were represented on the array and adequately measured responded as previously reported Figure 1b To further examine the expression changes induced in response to androgen we conducted two additional sets of experiments In the first LNCaP cells were treated for 24 hours with dihydrotestosterone DHT the predominant androgen found in the prostate in vivo A clear relationship was observed between increasing dose of DHT and increased levels of gene expression Figure 2aand see Additional data files Furthermore the pattern of expression changes observed in response to DHT largely paralleled those observed after treatment with R1881 R 2 0 7705 Figure 2b We conducted a second set of experiments to examine the response of LNCaP cells to androgen withdrawal After carrying cells in androgen replete media with charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum FBS supplemented with 1 nM R1881 cells were passaged in media without androgen and harvested at 48 and 70 hours Figure 2a After 48 hours the change in gene expression pattern was largely reciprocal to that induced by androgen treatment and these effects increased by 70 hours For the SAM selected gene set expression patterns after 70 hours of androgen deprivation were inversely correlated with those seen 50 hours after R1881 treatment R 2 0 7119 Figure 2c We have previously observed that varied stimuli produce temporally complex changes in gene expression patterns in yeast and mammalian cells in vitro 13 14 15 In many cases genes can be grouped by their expression patterns using hierarchical clustering and these groups often comprise genes that are functionally related To our surprise genes in the SAM generated dataset varied little in their expression between 8 and 72 hours after androgen treatment In general expression levels of genes induced or repressed by androgen treatment remained at a constant level between 8 and 72 hours As the SAM procedure identified genes with significant changes in expression in androgen treated cells compared to controls we were concerned that genes had been excluded whose expression levels varied for only part of the time course Analysis of the raw data by hierarchical clustering analysis alone again generally failed to identify genes whose expression varied over the time course The lack of complexity in the temporal response to androgen in this dataset precludes useful grouping of genes based on differences in their responses by cluster analysis Perhaps a more detailed investigation of expression changes within the first 8 hours after treatment will reveal temporal patterns of response of LNCaP to androgens and provide additional insights into androgen action We were curious to know whether the expression changes observed in LNCaP would also occur in other androgen responsive human prostate cancer cell lines MDA PCa 2a MDA PCa 2b and LAPC 4 or in LNCaP and LAPC 4 subclones carried in androgen depleted conditions for extended periods All cell lines were treated with 1 nM R1881 and at least one sample was collected between 20 and 70 hours after addition of R1881 RNA samples from treated and control cell lines were compared directly on the same microarray Responses to androgen of the set of transcripts identified as androgen responsive in the LNCaP experiments were examined in each of these cell lines Many genes were modulated similarly in all of the cell lines suggesting conservation of a specific androgen responsive program perhaps a vestige of the prostatic epithelial phenotype between these cell lines Figure 3 see also 12 and Additional data files For example the transcript levels of 310 of these genes changed by 1 5 fold or more in MDA PCa 2a and 2b cells following 48 hours of exposure to R1881 transcripts for 262 genes changed by 1 5 fold or greater in single treatments of all four LNCaP androgen deprived subclones and transcripts for 81 genes changed by 1 5 fold or greater in the three LAPC 4 and LAPC 4 androgen deprived array experiments There were a few noteworthy differences in expression profiles between the cell lines When we focused our attention on transcripts whose relative abundance changed by more than 2 6 fold in at least two experiments 12 and see Additional data files one group of genes differed strikingly between the cell lines Figure 4 Most of the genes in this group have previously been found to be consistently expressed at significantly higher levels in proliferating cells 10 16 Treatment with 1 nM R1881 promotes proliferation in the MDA PCa 2a and 2b cell lines has no proliferative effect in the LNCaP and LAPC 4 cell lines and represses proliferation in LNCaP cell lines carried for prolonged periods in conditions of androgen deprivation data not shown and see references in 17 18 19 As seen in Figure 3 the proliferation cluster is relatively induced in the MDA PCa 2a and 2b cell lines shows little change in LNCaP and LAPC 4 and is repressed in the androgen deprived LNCaP cell lines Thus transcript levels of the genes in this proliferation cluster parallel the responses of these cell lines to treatment with androgens The expression patterns induced by R1881 offer possible insights into the effects of androgens in prostate physiology Many features of the androgen induced expression program appear to be related to activation of the cell s capacity to produce seminal fluid After puberty the normal prostate produces a protein and organic solute rich fluid that contributes approximately 30 50 of the volume of the ejaculate The prostatic secretions are poorly characterized but are undoubtedly critical to fertility as the prostate is the only sex accessory gland present in nearly all mammals 20 Androgen induces several classes of genes that contribute to the production and secretion of prostatic fluid Perhaps the most striking change caused by treatment with R1881 occurs in the class of genes that contribute to the synthesis and modification of secretory proteins All androgen responsive genes in this class show increased expression in response to androgen We have previously identified putative secretory and membrane bound proteins based on their synthesis on membrane associated polysomes 21 and M D and P O B unpublished observations and over 200 of these are among the androgen responsive genes see 12 and Additional data files Included in this set are genes encoding proteins previously known to be secreted by the prostate into the seminal plasma including prostate specific antigen PSA sorbitol dehydrogenase apolipoprotein D 22 and vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF 23 An additional set consists of 30 androgen responsive genes with roles in protein trafficking and secretory vesicle formation and in transport of secretory vesicles Figure 5a This set of genes includes several with roles in membrane budding vesicular formation and membrane fusion and translocation of proteins across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum Androgen treatment also induced a number of genes that participate in protein folding and glycosylation Figure 5b One of these FK506 binding protein 5 FKBP51 a recently described androgen target 24 was the most highly induced gene more than 20 fold we observed in our experiments FK506 binding protein 5 FKBP51 is a co chaperone protein that has peptidylprolyl isomerase activity and interacts with the progesterone receptor 25 Whether it functions in the processing of androgen induced secretory proteins or in other pathways induced by androgens or perhaps even in cell cell signaling is unclear but the degree of induction suggests it may have an important role in prostatic physiology Prostatic fluid is also rich in small organic compounds that account for much of its osmotic pressure For instance prostatic secretions contain the highest levels of polyamines of all bodily fluids The transcript encoding ornithine decar boxylase ODC a known androgen target that catalyzes the rate limiting step in polyamine biosynthesis 26 was induced coordinately with enzymes that catalyze downstream steps in polyamine synthetic pathway spermine synthase spermidine spermine N 1 acetyltransferase and S adenosylmethionine decarboxylase Figure 5c Cholesterol and lipids are also found at high levels in semen and are major components of secretory vesicles referred to as prostasomes which are thought to regulate the function of spermatozoa 27 Note that several genes for proteins involved in cholesterol biosynthesis HMG CoA reductase IDI1 sterol C4 methyl oxidase and fatty acid metabolism ACAT2 DEGS ACATN FACL3 PEC1 were modulated by R1881 Choline sorbitol amino acids and citrate are also found in the prostatic secretions although only a few genes for sorbitol dehy drogenase phosphatidylcholine transfer protein amino acid transporter related to these pathways appeared to respond directly to androgen Citrate production is regulated by transport of aspartate into the mitochondria by aspartate amino transferase and indeed the gene encoding this enzyme was induced by androgen in each of these cell lines 28 Genes encoding several mitochondrial proteins were also induced in response to androgen perhaps reflecting the increased production of citrate or the increased demand for energy in these cells as they mobilize secretory pathways Zinc calcium phosphate potassium sodium chloride and other ions are abundant in the ejaculate although sodium and chloride are at levels below their serum concentrations Several transporter molecules and ion channel genes which may have roles in the active transfer of these ions into and out of the lumen of the prostate acini and secretory granules were modulated in response to R1881 Figure 5d Transport of sodium and chloride out of the lumen of the prostate acini is accompanied by the passive transfer of water and the prostatic secretions are thereby concentrated 20 Transport of ions and small organic compounds into the acinar lumen will concentrate them in the seminal plasma The ank gene which codes for a transmembrane protein that secretes pyrophosphate into joint spaces 29 was strongly induced by R1881 exposure Our data suggests that the pyrophosphate in the ejaculate maybe secreted into the prostatic fluid by the ANK protein The prostate undergoes dramatic morphologic changes as it acquires the ability to produce seminal fluid and these changes can be observed at puberty or by stimulating the prostate with androgens after castration The epithelial cells proliferate and change from stratified to cuboidal while glands branch and acini expand These morphologic changes follow complex reprogramming of the prostate cell that involves poorly understood alterations of the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix and changes in downstream signaling pathways 30 31 Many genes encoding components of the extracellular matrix proteins important in cell cell interactions and cytoskeletal proteins were regulated in response to R1881 suggesting that they may participate in the morphologic changes induced by androgens Figure 6a 6b Many previous studies have pointed to a critical role for the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix in transducing signals for growth differentiation and secretion in normal and cancerous prostate cells 32 Our data may therefore help point to one important feature of the transcriptional program that sets the stage for these signaling events We also found evidence of modulation of several genes encoding transcriptional regulatory and signaling proteins in response to androgen in the prostate cancer cell lines Figure 6c 6d It is possible that some of these pathways have important roles in reprogramming the normal prostate cell in response to androgen 33 However some of these signaling and transcriptional proteins may be modulated abnormally in these cancer derived cell lines because of molecular genetic alterations acquired with transformation 34 35 Yet other pathways may not be direct targets of AR activation but could be modulated in response to androgen induced changes in the internal or external milieu of the cells For instance treatment of LNCaP with androgens has been shown to cause a burst of oxidative stress that may contribute to prostate carcinogenesis 19 The observed increased expression of NF B and several DNA repair and stress response genes may be a secondary response to this oxidative stress rather than a direct response to AR signaling 36 Further work will clearly be necessary to dissect the roles of these signaling pathways in the response of the prostate to AR activation In summary we have provided a global characterization of the gene expression programs triggered by androgen exposure in human prostate cancer cells Analysis of the gene expression program induced by R1881 strongly suggests that all of these prostate cancer cell lines retain features of prostatic epithelial cells despite being derived from prostate cancer metastases and despite their long propagation in vitro We recognize that the in vitro model systems used here offer at best only an approximation of normal and cancerous prostatic epithelia Nevertheless we believe that many of the target genes identified in these experiments are likely to be regulated similarly in vivo just as PSA clearly is and might serve as clinically useful diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets These data may also offer some insight into the contribution of the prostate to the normal seminal fluid including molecular components that may be important in fertility Further investigation into androgen induced changes in gene and protein expression in vitro and in vivo will undoubtedly shed light on prostatic physiology and prostatic carcinoma and also on broader physiological functions of androgen Beyond applications of these data to studies on the role of androgen in prostatic cells this work provides a foundation for future investigation into androgen signaling in other model systems Comparison of the transcriptional programs induced by androgen in other examples of the diverse cells and tissues that respond to androgen will undoubtedly contribute to a molecular understanding of the basis of the diverse and profound effects of androgens on human development and physiology and in human diseases Materials and methods Cell culture and androgen treatments The LNCaP cell line was obtained from the ATCC and maintained in RPMI media with 10 FBS and penicillin streptomycin The LN95 LN96 LN97 and LN98 variants of LNCaP designated by the year in which androgen free culture was initiated 18 were maintained in RPMI media without phenol red and with 10 charcoal stripped dextran filtered FBS Hyclone Logan UT and penicillin streptomycin The MDA PCa 2a and MDA PCa 2b cells were generously provided by Nora Navone at the University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center and were cultured in defined BRFF HPC1 media Biological Research Faculty Facility Ijamsville MD and maintained on poly lysine coated tissue culture plates Becton Dickinson Labware Franklin Lakes NJ The LAPC 4 cells were cultured in Iscove s media with 10 FBS and penicillin streptomycin and the androgen deprived variant LAPC 4 AD was maintained in Iscove s without phenol red and with 10 charcoal stripped FBS Before androgen treatments LNCaP and LAPC 4 cells were androgen deprived by 48 h culture in media without phenol red containing 10 dextran filtered charcoal stripped FBS For the MDA cells media was F12K supplemented with 1 charcoal stripped FBS 40 mM phosphoethanolamine 10 pg ml hydrocortisone 45 nM selenious acid 5 g ml insulin and 10 ng ml epidermal growth factor EGF 6 After androgen deprivation cells were treated with either R1881 or DHT NEN Life Science Products Boston MA dissolved in ethanol or ethanol carrier alone and incubated for varying lengths of time The final concentration of ethanol in media was 0 01 Messenger RNA was prepared from cells using the Oligotex Direct kit for direct isolation of polyadenylated RNAs Qiagen Chatsworth CA DNA microarray hybridizations and data analysis The DNA microarrays used in this study consisted of PCR amplified cDNAs printed on modified glass microscope slides as described previously 37 Each array contained 24 000 cDNA spots representing approximately 18 000 unique human genes and expressed sequence tags ESTs Some of the samples were also analyzed on microarrays with 9 600 cDNA elements Microarray hybridizations were carried out according to previously published protocols 14 37 38 39 For each hybridization 2 g of each purified sample of polyadenylated RNA was reverse transcribed in the presence of fluorescently labeled nucleoside triphosphates Cy3 dUTP for reference sample Cy5 dUTP for experimental sample Pairs of labeled cDNAs were hybridized to microarray slides for 16 18 h at 65 C in solution with blocking agents After several washes microarrays were scanned with a GenePix microarray scanner Axon Instruments and were analyzed with either Scanalyze or Genepix software After visual inspection spots of insufficient quality were flagged and excluded from further analysis Data files were entered into the Stanford Microarray Database 40 and compiled experimental data were further analyzed with hierarchical clustering software and visualized with Treeview software 41 42 43 Identities of genes or hypothetical genes represented by the spotted cDNAs are based on information available in UniGene cluster Build 144 November 2001 44 Statistical analysis of microarray data Genes with potentially significant changes in expression in response to androgen treatment were identified using the SAM procedure 11 45 Changes in gene expression for any single gene as measured in several array experiments provide a statistically testable measure of robustness regardless of the magnitude of change in expression The SAM procedure computes a two sample T statistic for example for androgen treated vs untreated cell lines for the normalized log ratios of gene expression levels for each gene It thresholds the T statistics to provide a significant gene list and provides an estimate of the false discovery rate the percentage of genes identified by chance alone from randomly permuted data For the experiments described in our study the raw expression ratio dataset was filtered using the program Cluster 43 for genes whose transcript levels differ from their median value by at least 1 5 fold in androgen treated cells compared to controls in at least two experiments with not more than 30 of measurements discarded because of poor data quality for each entry To minimize noise only genes with fluorescent intensity in each channel that was greater than 1 4 times the local background were selected Two sets of time course experiments were included in the analysis The filtered dataset containing more than 3 900 genes was then analyzed with the SAM procedure We used a selection threshold giving a median estimate of 0 5 false positive genes false detection rate of 0 088 for further analysis This list consists of 517 unique genes of 568 total cDNAs of which 421 are induced and 96 are repressed by exposure to R1881 Additional data files
