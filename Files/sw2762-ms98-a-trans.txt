          um you know one thing that i miss being in a small company is the opportunity for um job growth just different job opportunity i was talking with somebody from Bausch and Lomb today and she was telling me how she started as a clerk typist and then found another opening in another department and moved on and so forth and so forth and is now uh personnel uh director and i mean its just its theres so much opportunity in a larger company to uh stay within the same company so youre not losing your seniority level but um just to try new things and and see new areas and departments and i mean you can in in a large company you can go from one department to another department as if if you switched companies sometimes   well yes you have an opportunity to  to use a J O B system which is a job opportunity system its most companies most big companies have that but   umhum   well i think sometime that you get lost in that also   uhhuh uhhuh   i really do i i i sometimes think that a small company may offer well im not sure how to put   well uhhuh   im not sure how to put this but thats not uh perhaps better one on one uh relations a a big company sometime you can get lost you can you can uh opportunities do arise   uhhuh   but the competition is much greater for that   uhhuh uhhuh well its true yeah   opportunity okay   there is a very uh uh at least in my office and i know thats not necessarily the way it is all over but the camaraderie within the office when youre with a small company i think youre right you could be even uh you can be a big person in a small company you know   exactly i and i think you get a lot more support from your coworkers and and often times in a big company you are asked to go and do things in other areas that   uhhuh uhhuh   may not be your expertise okay but they require you to do this as their as your uh stepping stone or whatever youd care to call it   uhhuh uhhuh   and and that can get to be sometimes very very disastrous with the consequences of that because people do the best they can   uhhuh sure   and often times its not really what   right   was aimed at in the first place if that makes sense   uhhuh i yeah i understand that you know a question that i have for you is um do you feel working working in a large company do you feel that you can see the impact that you make do you feel that you can see like the results i know in my company each person is vital because we are the company and each person really can see the results that they produce   yes i can i see that in my job because my particular job is of of a troubleshooting nature and im you know its one of these put out fires things  so   uhhuh oh uhhuh   i can see the results of that   i see yeah   but um yes i im i i get a lot of gratification from my job but some some folks i guess they go to work every day and they just go to work for a paycheck every every two weeks or every month or whatever   yeah i i   but in my particular job i really enjoy it because i do have an opportunity to help other people do better okay and i really like that   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh i i do feel bad for the people i mean obviously we all work for a paycheck but its nice if you can be enjoying it you know while youre doing it   yes yeah i i i also teach school at at TI at uh Texas Instruments im a im an instructor there so   oh uhhuh   i teach new well not new employees but all yeah all employee any employees really that that care to and we talked about the job opportunity system we have uh a system where we train people to to become what we call automation specialists   uhhuh   and and its a job where if you as a secretary you decide you want to be uh an automation specialist which is a much higher paying job and a much more technical job   uhhuh   and then you would come to one of our inhouse classes   that is great   on on company time   oh really   and and and or on overtime so we dont involve the the uh production process okay of of personnel coming to our classes and we set up and establish these   uhhuh   sixteen and twenty week classes at at uh three hours a day twice a week for automation specialist training   that is wonderful   when you finish hopefully youve acquired enough knowledge to uh you know move on into advanced machinery type operations and   uhhuh   and and that thats really gratifying to me i i see a lot of young folks come in and and gals and guys both and some gals that say ive no i dont know a hammer from a a nail or a wrench i mean you know and okay thats and thats where well start but and we have the other side of the coin where you have you know really advanced people   uhhuh uhhuh well yeah   coming in and and top notch uh mechanical type people and they want to do better so they of come they they jump right on it   uhhuh uhhuh that is great and that is so smart because with uh everything becoming so much more technical and sophisticated youre just not finding people out in the work force that have the skills that you necessarily need   no thats a fact and   i mean you just dont find them and it its such such a great way take the people that you already have and train them   and train and train them we sometimes we have to uh simply for for two reasons one   yeah uhhuh   that we we are changing jobs constantly where we are changing our methods of doing things and we are finding more economical methods and more   uhhuh uhhuh   okay and the other thing is we cannot find the people outside to just walk in off the street and help us   uhhuh right   so but that would be the same in your type of secretarial job im that one time we the girls used to have just the typewriter and they   uhhuh exactly   and then they had word processors and now theyve got full blown desk top publishers so you know   oh my oh exactly i mean its incredible   it is i im that amazes me that you know people say your job amazes me well my job is really nothing i sit there and i watch some little gal make me all kinds of charts and view foils and graphs and   um yeah   yeah uhhuh   and its i its you know they use laser printers and all that and its absolutely mind boggling uh because i could probably turn it on before i get the screen to go completely blank you know and i generally do that   wow yeah   uhhuh uhhuh   but i i was in the same situation i had to learn   right   i i had no knowledge of a computer at all im a master mechanic but not a computer expert   right   but now im in to Lotus and word processing and i can hold my own with that   oh thats great that is fabulous   but um   you know another benefit that that i wish i had more of and who wouldnt is vacation time   uhhuh yeah   you know um i think that uh when when youre working and an especially i dont know i mean every job you you say how youre constantly putting out fires you know i i feel like my job is like that too unfortunately but that just it drains you you know after a while it just   yeah i i i feel that way and its a long time to get you know you work for many years with two weeks vacation per year   yeah yeah exactly right   and then if you have extra days out for what other reasons uh there may be uh an and we we try to deal on an individual basis with them but you can be penalized for that an and it its penalized against your merit increases and et cetera   uhhuh oh oh wow   so i mean you are allowed a certain number of days of what we call sick time and personal time off but if you you know if you extend beyond those   uhhuh uhhuh   an and at times we will adjust on a one to one basis   right uhhuh   for some unusual circumstances but   uhhuh   to work for a company almost fifteen years with two weeks vacation it seems to me like an awful long time   its hard is that uh what your company policy is too   well no it well in some instances yes   uhhuh   okay in some instances it would be we start with a a weeks vacation and then its two weeks after a year or so   uhhuh   but then that two weeks stays and then it goes to three weeks for a long long time and then after fifteen years its four weeks   uhhuh uhhuh oh my goodness   but thats still thats a long time you know   but that is a long time and especially when you take a weeks vacation i was just talking to somebody about this today its funny it takes you until Tuesday or Wednesday to really wind down   oh sure   you know to say okay i i can relax i can sit here for an hour if i want to and just not do anything and realize that you dont have to be worrying about something you know   i think uh i would like to see i would like to see more well its like the kids were talking in California about going to school all year but they have breaks every ninety days or thirty days or ninety days or whatever it is they have two weeks off or a week off or something   uhhuh uhhuh right   and they find that thats much better for them than having the whole summer off an where theyre completely bored like the second month into i think i think industry really would really   uhhuh thats true   benefit from that   uhhuh   im not sure how we would accommodate all of our people being on vacation at all various times but we would always be shorthanded i guess but so thats a problem you know thats a problem pardon me   yeah well thats where temporaries come in they could hire temporaries to fill in   well yes thats and thats exactly what we do in many instances you know where our work load increases an and our vacation periods and stuff   uhhuh uhhuh   of course we have uh what we called an SDS a Summer Development Student Program so   oh   we we put a lot of school um   like a coop type thing for the summer   college pardon me   like a coop for the summer almost   yeah yeah they work for us and and they they go to school back in the Fall   uhhuh uhhuh   and hopefully when they get out of college they consider us to come on fulltime   right   and theyve uh established themselves with a work pattern an and the you know theyre familiar to our   uhhuh uhhuh right   our ways and stuff and theyre on our records and we find that thats very very helpful   yeah i that is and uh it also gives you a chance you know to look at these kids and make your own determinations   you sound uh like a very young person   im twenty five   i
