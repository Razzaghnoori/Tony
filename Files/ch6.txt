Chapter Emergence and StoryBeyond Newton Einstein and BohrHow brazen a chapter subtitle Beyond Newton Einstein and Bohr Yet hints we shall find for the science of Newton Einstein and Bohr remains innocent of the propagating coconstructing organization of autonomous agents of nonequilibrium systems building a biosphere Yet surely the biosphere is part of the universe and any general laws of the universe must necessarily encompass biospheres here and if a general biology is necessary elsewhere in the vastness we glimpseAnd emergence and story What manner of foolishness is this Story Surely story is not the stuV of science Im not so sure Story is the natural way we autonomous agents talk about our raw getting on with it mucking through making a living If story is not the stuV of science yet is about how we get on with making our everchanging livings then science not story must change Our making our everchanging livings is part of the unfolding of the physical universeWould you rather be Einstein or Shakespeare Im not sure whose genius is the more awesome I come hesitantly to believe we need both science and story to make sense of a universe in which we agents part of the universe get on with our embodied knowhow we who strut and fret our hour upon the stage Then are heard no more Hardly Our successes and failures trickle tumble and torrentially build the future of our biosphere We Americans fearful of Sputnik land men and mass on the moon Parting we leave mass on the moon and thereby change the orbital dynamics of the solar system and beyond Calculate that Newton genius that you were From what initial and boundary conditions would you could you startBut again we have not had nor have we yet a theory of the propagating coconstructing organization that is a biosphere built of autonomous agents and their shenanigansOh confusion Perhaps a certain confusion is healthy We have not tried to embrace all of this at once beforeHierarchies of Autonomous AgentsFor a start there appears to be an indefinite hierarchy of autonomous agents At least in our biosphere there is a considerable hierarchy of autonomous agents Consider first a singlecell organism prokaryote cells without nuclei such as E coli in your gut E coli my canonical autonomous agent Next consider a eukaryote yeast also in your gut also an autonomous agent In the passage from prokaryote to eukaryotic cell it appears that a collection of autonomous agents came to live together permanently Eukaryotes contain mitochondria and plant cells contain plastids with chlorophyll In both cases these intracellular organelles carry their own DNA with a slightly modified genetic code in the case of mitochondria These facts have suggested to Lynn Margulis the now rather wellaccepted hypothesis that eukaryotic cells are symbionts of two or more earlier separate autonomous agents that contributed the mitochondria the plastids and perhaps the nuclear structure of eukaryotes into a single novel reproducing entity the eukaryotic cellThe eukaryotic cell then is a wellbehaved society of autonomous agents that are now symbiotic hence the eukaryotic cell is a higherorder autonomous agent comprised of lowerorder autonomous agentsBut life has burgeoned beyond singlecelled creatures The sea is filled with eukaryotic colonial organismsmulticellular usually capable of sexual reproduction but also capable of asexual reproduction by budding clumps of cells that reform the various organs feeding tubes mouths stinging cells musculature nerve system Blessed proliferating profusion of ways of beingAnd of course since about  billion years ago and surely since the Ediacrin  million years ago and the Cambrian period  million years ago there have come to exist us multicellular sexually reproducing juggernautsTyrannosaurus rex really was a juggernaut of an autonomous agent A blue whale isnt so trifling either Neither is the wideflung stand of aspen astride the hillsides above Santa Fe largest single stand of aspen in the United States presumably all or most of which is a linked set of trees sprouting from the spreading roots of some initial individual Julius Rebek a chemist now at the Scripps Institute is fond of saying that the biggest molecule he knows of is Number  Illinois coal a massive hunk of coal several miles long and wide and hundreds of feet deep Maybe Number  Illinois coal is from a single clonally linked stand of aspen cousinsSo we confront a hierarchy of autonomous agents If our definition of an autonomous agent should include that it be an individual capable of reproducing then maybe whales are about as big as such agents get in the current biosphere Thats a long way up in mass and molecules from the minimal autonomous agent I sketched in chapter How far can the hierarchy go Who knowsPerhaps the simplest step in this hierarchy would be the hypothetical and now almost experimentally realized hypercycle invented by Manfred Eigen and Peter Schuster The hypothetical hypercycle consists of a set of replicating RNA sequences say A B C and D each of which is actually a plus and minus strand that are template complements But in addition to A BC and D each replicating individually A helps B replicate B helps C replicate C helps D replicate and D helps A replicate Thinking of each plusminus RNA strand pair as a replicating cycle of two template strands these replicating cycles are linked in the ABCD hypercycleIn fact the hypercycle is a small society of molecular replicators that help one another replicate hence it is a higherorder molecular replicating system Reza Ghadiri has nearly created a peptide hypercycle and probably soon will achieve a real experimental example While the hypercycle of Eigen and Schuster does not yet fulfill my definition of an autonomous agent because no work cycles are done nevertheless we have no trouble imagining a hypercycle of autonomous agents Indeed presumably the eukaryotic cell is more or less just such a hypercycleWe have beginning mathematical models that reveal something about this hierarchical organizationalthough the best current models are curiously limited despite their brillianceWalter Fontana is a theoretical chemist trained by Peter Schuster in Vienna Walter came to the Santa Fe Institute and made a major intellectual step called Alchemy In chapter  I described the emergence of autocatalytic sets of molecular species in a chemical reaction graph By rather independent intellectual routes that began with physicist John McCaskills eVorts to create a computer soup of Turing machines that operated on one another Walter invented algorithmic chemistry Naturally and most naturally in Santa Fe where one can be healed by means known nowhere else in the universe Walter nicknamed algorithmic chemistry Alchemy Unlike the alchemy of Newtons time Walters worksHere is alchemy Walter borrowed a computer language known as lisp Lisp expressions can operate on one another So expression  encounters expression  At random it is decided if  will operate on  or  will operate on  Whichever way after the operation the lisp expression that was operated on typically is transformed into a new lisp expressionYou see the analogy to chemistry The transformation of the lisp expression to a new lisp expression is rather like a chemical reaction The operating lisp expression that does the transformation is rather like an enzyme catalyzing a reactionSo Walter let loose a pot full of  lisp expressions in a computer These merrily bumped into one another creating new lisp expressions Walter as a good theoretical chemist from the EigenSchuster tradition imagined his algorithmic chemistry in a chemostat that would hold the total number of lisp expressions at a constant  So if extra lisp expressions drove the total above  Walter randomly chose enough lisp expressions to eliminate from the pot to keep the total at  This pruning back to a total of  provides a selection pressure for lisp expressions that are formed more often than averageWalter let loose the floodgates of his alchemical world A torrent of ever new lisp expressions then stunningly a few then more often one sees an enlarging population of a subset of alreadyseen lisp expressionsWhat had Walter found The first thing he found were copiers that is lisp expressions that could copy any lisp expression including themselves Once such replicators emerged they took over Walters steaming pot of lisp expressions Indeed such a lisp expression is rather like Jack Szostaks hopedfor RNA polymerase able to copy any RNA sequence including itself Walter called such copiers type organizationsCould other selfreproducing organizations emerge Walter cheated and simply disallowed copier replicators to occur Bereft of copiers Walters soup ripped forward again Again novel lisp expressions came forth in profusion Again after a while a recurrent set of lisp expressions emergedWhat had Walter found He found collectively autocatalytic sets of lisp expressions essentially identical to my collectively autocatalytic sets of polymers Walter called these type organizations In each such collectively autocatalytic lisp set each expression is formed by the action of some lisp expression on some lisp expression in the set The set as a whole is collectively reproducingBut could one find a hierarchy beyond type organizations Further research has gotten as far as a kind of type organization which consists of two or more type organizations that jointly coexist and create a kind of mutual glue of lisp expressions The glue would not be formed by either type organization alone but is the conjoint construction of the plurality of type organizationsSo a modest hierarchy of algorithmic chemical systems has been found The type organizations seem analogical to eukaryotic cells that harbor diVerent replicators mitochondria plasmids nuclei in a common mutual glue of cytoplasm and shared processesCuriously no higherorder organization has yet been seen It is deeply interesting to me that no one knows why What is limiting the persistent emergence of novel reproducing algorithmic systemsIndeed there are now a modest diversity of algorithmic models such as Tom Rays Tierra In Tierra computer strings live in the memory core reproduce and fight one another for space in the core A reaper kills random critters Evolution to form a variety of parasites and hyperparasites occurs including some slightly hierarchical agents Interestingly again the total diversity of types of critters is limitedAs John McCaskill another theoretical physicistchemist in the EigenSchuster group points out no one has succeeded so far in creating an algorithmic system of reproducing entities that generates impressive hierarchical agents or persistent increasingly complex organization Again no one knows whyIt is possible that the constraint to algorithmic critters may be the problem Indeed I will suggest that the biosphere is richer than that which can in the normal senses I know be called algorithmic That which is algorithmic is eVectively constructable by a formal procedure that begins with definable input data and is operated upon by a program in the Turing or von Neumann sense But I will argue that we cannot prestate some biological analogue of the input data nor is there some biological analogue of the program governing the unfolding of a biosphere I will argue that the configuration space of a biosphere cannot be finitely prestated that persistent novelty occurs in the biosphere and universe as a whole And I will opine that if we cannot finitely prestate the configuration space of a biosphere then something is odd with how we have been taught to do our science for in Newtonian physics Einsteins physics and Bohrs physics one can finitely prestate the configuration space in question In chapter  borrowing on joint work with quantum gravity scholar and friend Lee Smolin I will suggest that if we cannot prestate the configuration space of a universe then time is real and necessary and that the way a universe constructs itself may have analogies to the way a biosphere constructs itselfRemember a propagating organization that builds itself and persistently ramifies in a nonequilibrium setting is not yet a concept that we understand We have matter energy and entropy but no clear notion of propagating organization in the sense we here struggle to articulate And because the way a biosphere gets on with constructing itself may not be algorithmic it may be that story is part of how we must in fact make sense of the persistent emergence of novelty in the biosphereWell thats a mouthful Well have to struggle below to see if it makes sense and might be correctI want to return to Walter Fontanas algorithmic chemistry to note an interesting feature Lets define higherorder machines in Walters chemistry We might think of bundles of lisp expressions where an input bundle of lisp expressions is fed into an assemblyline bundle of lisp expressions to yield an output bundle Nothing prevents our consideration of such bundles Given a set of possible initial lisp expressions say N diVerent expressions the diVerent subsets or bundles that are possible are just two raised to the Nth power This N set is called the power set of the N symbol strings A bundle acting on a bundle may produce a bundle In general this is just a mapping on the power set in which machine bundles act on input bundles to yield output bundles that is the set of possible input bundles machines and output bundles is the set of possible mappings of the power set into itselfWell obviously one could get bundles of lisp expressionscomplex assembly lines of lisp expressions acting as machines on complex ordered sets of bundled input lisp expressions to yield ordered sets of bundled output lisp expressions Here the ordering of the lisp expressions would define the assemblyline sequence of operations of the machine lisp bundle and the ordering of lisp expressions in the input bundle would define the order in which the machine acted on the set of lisp expressions in the input bundle And just as obviously if Walter got type and type autocatalytic sets of simple lisp expressions one could get type and type autocatalytic sets of machine lisp bundles operating on one another And if sets of machines could be ordered into units to act on sets of input bundles to yield sets of output bundles still higherorder autocatalytic sets of type and type should emergeWhy didnt Walter find these higherorder entities I suspect part of the answer is because nothing in his algorithmic chemistry abets the ordering of lisp expressions into ordered sets treated as units and machines by one another The collective properties of ordered sets of lisp expressions are not recognized and acted upon as collective objects by Walters soup of lisp expressionsBut such limitations seem not to hinder the biosphere We do witness the emergence of molecular assembly lines and molecular assemblages whose collective properties are recognized and acted upon by natural selection The transcription and translation of the DNA code to messenger RNA and protein is one example But there are others Many enzymes form ordered arrays of multimolecular complexes in which a substrate is progressively passed from one to another active site along an analogy to an assembly line These higherorder complexes of molecular devices arise because natural selection is able to act upon the collective properties of such molecular aggregates when those collective properties augment adaptive fitness In eVect natural selection recognizes the life context in which the collective behaviors of these higherorder molecular structures are advantageousIt is important to stress an obvious feature of the biosphere in contrast to the algorithmic computational systems of Fontana Ray and others The algorithmic systems manipulate symbols according to discrete welldefined transformation rules a kind of algebramapping symbols or symbol strings into symbol stringsIn contrast the biosphere is built up of the doings the embodied knowhow carryings on of autonomous agentsreal physical molecular systems grafting a flow of matter and energy constraint construction and organization into their persistent coevolution As we will see belowwhere I give grounds to think that we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere hence cannot prestate the adaptations that may come to exist in an evolving biospherereal macroscopic physical systems that are autonomous agents may not be constrained in what they can produce as is a formal mathematical algebraic symbol system If so then the algorithmic freedom of a biosphere is deeply important for the science of Newton Einstein and Bohr all suppose prediction by algorithmic calculationIndeed I suspect that the persistent innovations in a biosphere stem in no small measure from the fact that while we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere the categories relevant to its unfolding novel functionalities the biosphere is not hampered by our failure at categorization Unlike the welldefined and formal transformation rules of an algebra or a calculational process such as lisp the transformation rules of the biosphere enlarge and change in ways that cannot be prespecified As concrete examples consider the evolution of the genetic code and consider the structure of eukaryotic chromosomes whose complex coordinated behaviors underlie both normal mitotic cell division and the astonishing sequence of meiotic reduction cell divisions in which maternal and paternal homologue chromosomes synapse undergo recombination and separate such that the final sperm or egg cell receives at random only one homologue of each parental chromosome The emergence of these complex macromolecular systems has altered the way evolution itself unfoldsRichard Palmer a physicist at Duke University and the Santa Fe Institute has commented to me that physics is used to distinguishing the initial and boundary conditions from the laws But in the evolution of a biosphere the emergence of systems such as the genetic code and meiosis seems rather like the emergence of new laws This has led Palmer to wonder whether the distinction between initial and boundary conditions and laws is really as clean as it appears in say Newtonian physicsThe Furniture of the UniverseAll of this has somehow to do with the question of the furniture of the universe and with the troublesome questions of emergence and reductionism These are contentious issues Philosophers and others have struggled with these issues for years I state merely some of their outlinesThere is a strong form of reductionism the x is nothing but y version We met an example of this form of reductionism earlier in the eVorts to make good on sense data and logical atomism where the hope was to build up an epistemology based on the least questionable propositions namely reports of sense data I seem to hear a middle C note now This seems to feel like a hard flat surface Then the statement A Windsor rocker is in the living room is nothing but a finitely prespecified list of statements about sense dataOn this definition of reductionism a higherlevel concept is reduced to a lowerlevel language if the truth of a defined set of statements in the lower language is both necessary and suYcient for the truth of a statement in the higher language If this could be done then the higherlevel statement is nothing but a shorthand for the list of necessary and suYcient statements in the lower reducing language Thus the truth of the statement There is a Windsor chair in my oYce would be reduced to the truth of some specifiable set of statements about sense data As we saw this eVort failed in the case of statements about physical objects and sense data While it is relatively easy to find suYcient sense data statements it appears to be impossible to finitely specify a set of necessary and suYcient sense data statements whose truth would be interchangeable with true statements about the Windsor chair in my oYceWittgenstein wrote persuasively that the same systematic diYculty was lodged in attempts to reduce one language game to another for example from a description of a legal event to a description in terms of mere human actions to a description in terms of physical events As we noted earlier legal descriptions involve a web of concepts concerning guilt innocence responsibility evidence admissible procedure that are absent from a description of human actions outside of the legal framework And descriptions of human actionsand a fortiori descriptions of the doings of autonomous agents even bacteria acting on their own behalf to get dinnerseem to involve a diVerent language game than mere descriptions in terms of physical eventsAmong other critical features of the actionanddoing language game is that compared to a hypothetical complete physical description the actionanddoing description picks out the relevant features with respect to the goals of the autonomous agent Interestingly once we are at Dennetts level of Popperian creatures which can have internal models of and plans for the future and can have their models die in their stead we seem to have arrived at a level of organization in which actionandgoal talk becomes essential Is there a finitely prestatable set of statements about physical events that is jointly necessary and suYcient for the truth of the statement The cheetah is hunting the gazelle Like other eVorts we will find suYcient conditions but be hard pressed to find jointly necessary and suYcient conditionsThe dictionary hints at where our reductionism ideas may go wrong Every word in the dictionary is defined in terms of other words How could it be otherwise Concepts are defined in webs somehow tacked onto the real world by ostensive definitionsdefinitions given by pointing to examples We carve up the world in a variety of ways Wittgensteins language games that appear not to be reducible to one another in the strict sense of necessary and suYcient conditions And this in turn underlies the question whether legal systems and human actions are parts of the furniture of the universe somehow above or in addition to the locations and motions of atoms and fieldsEven at the level of basic physical theory the same issues arise For example classical thermodynamics is a welldefined science in its own right Ludwig Boltzmann Willard Gibbs and others struggled to invent statistical mechanics based on Newtonian laws operating on a set of idealized particles in the Ndimensional phase space we have discussed It is generally seen as a triumph that the classical thermodynamic concepts of temperature pressure and entropy were reduced to statistical features of idealized sets of gas particles temperature becoming the average kinetic energy of the particles pressure the momentum transferred to the walls of the vessel and entropy a measure of the number of microstates per macrostateBut before complete triumph is declared we should ask whether statistical mechanics constitutes a set of necessary and suYcient statements with respect to classical thermodynamics The answer appears to be no While statistical mechanics based on Newtonian forces yields a set of suYcient conditions that statistical mechanics is not jointly necessary and suYcient David Gross and other physicist colleagues have confirmed to me that one could construct diVerent consistent statistical mechanics based on particles following nonNewtonian laws all of which would be interpretable as reductions of classical thermodynamics So even at the heart where reduction is supposed to have taken place there seems to be no finitely prestateable set of necessary and suYcient conditions on a lower level over a set of possible statistical mechanics that would jointly suYce for a reduction of classical thermodynamicsThe same problem arises with Darwinian theory Darwin tells us that evolution occurs by reproduction with heritable variation and natural selection Our biology based on DNA and RNA and proteins is an instantiation a suYcient condition for Darwinian evolution Could we now state all possible physical systems that might be capable of replication heritable variation and natural selection I think notThere is a weaker sense of reductionism namely the casting of an account of a higherlevel object concept or phenomenon in terms of a suYcient but not necessary and suYcient set of conditions at a lower level In this sense statistical mechanics surely does account for classical mechanics Many argue that this weaker sense of reductionism suYces Well suYces for what That is a bit harder to be clear about Roughly the temptation is to say Temperature is nothing but the average kinetic energy of the atoms in the system that is we appear to reduce the ontological furniture of the universeI suspect that this familiar ontological move is not always warranted Lets take some cases that Phil Anderson uses to exemplify emergence Gold is a yellow malleable metal familiar to all of us Nowhere in the quantum mechanical description of atomic gold are these macroscopic properties to be found Moreover there is no deductive way to arrive at these macroscopic collective properties from the underlying quantum mechanics of atoms of gold Rather we observe the macroscopic properties find lawful features of those properties then attempt to link them to suYcient conditions in our quantum mechanical description of matterAnother class of cases Anderson refers to is broken symmetries A familiar example would be a pole standing vertically on an horizontal slab on the earths surface The vertical pole is unstable in the face of gravity and will soon fall It might fall and point in any direction Hence the system has the full symmetry of the plane prior to the falling of the pole In due course the pole does fall over and points in some specific direction Thereby the symmetry of the system prior to falling has been broken We cannot deduce from the symmetry of the initial state how that symmetry will be brokenPhil entitled his article relevant to this issue of emergence More Is DiVerentLets try it with my definition of autonomous agents As I have already hinted systems capable of selfreproduction and thermodynamic work cycles are presumably not limited to our current DNA RNA proteinbased cells Almost certainly pure protein and small molecule systems can be autonomous agents Almost certainly pure RNA and small molecule systems can be autonomous agents But perhaps selfgravitating systems lasing systems and a variety of other physical systems can be autonomous agentsAgain we can give several suYcient conditions but apparently we cannot finitely prespecify a set of necessary and suYcient conditions that would allow us to prespecify all the possible patterns of construction constraint and organization of physical processes and matter flows that would constitute an autonomous agentOn the other hand my definition does seem to aVord a postconstruction test Bring us a candidate autonomous agent and we can ask of it Do you reproduce yourself and carry out at least one thermodynamic work cycle The answer is either yes or no and is an objective fact about the entity in question So one begins to see a pattern here We may not be able to finitely prespecify all the possible systems that constitute an autonomous agent but we can recognize one when we see it We can give suYcient but not necessary and suYcient conditions for all physical realizations of an autonomous agent and we can check any specific candidate case Further any specific candidate case either is or is not an autonomous agent The statement The bacterium is an autonomous agent is either true or falseBased on this I want to say that autonomous agents are parts of the ontological furniture of the universe I also want to say with Phil Anderson that emergence is real and utterly nonmysteriousOn this view of emergence the autonomous agent is more than the sum of its parts but not in the sense that the behavior of the autonomous agent is not explicable as the total organization of the parts organized into the whole agent in its environment Rather an autonomous agent is more than the sum of its parts in the sense that a wide varietyindeed an indefinite varietyof physical systems could be autonomous agents in the same sense selfreproducing systems carrying out at least one work cycleNow we can turn to causality The nothing but version of reduction an autonomous agent is nothing but has tended historically to see causality as running only upward from the behaviors of atoms to their causal consequences in the behavior of larger entities such as tigersBut I find myself troubled by this view and will provide an example of why Millions of years ago the last female trilobite Tomasina was hurrying to find a good place to lay her eggs Suddenly Tomasina saw a hideous starfish named Darthvader dead ahead Left or right What shall I do she wondered Tomasina jumped left Darthvader jumped right caught Tomasina killed her and devoured her and her eggsThere are no more trilobites Moreover when Tomasina died she took with her the unique proteins and small molecules that were trilobite molecular species These kinds of molecules are gone from the biosphere So too are descendant mutant molecules that might have arisen from further speciation from Tomasinas tribe Furthermore other chemical reactions which might have been catalyzed transforming some molecular species to others that Tomasinas molecules and those of her descendants might have catalyzed have perhaps never come to be in the biosphere that has evolved over the succeeding eonsNow Tomasina is lost as an entire organism acting in an environment Yet the causal consequences of her wrong guess of direction to jump have propagated downward to lower levels of organization namely the molecular species of which the biosphere is composedDownward causation is real and nonmystical There are now more old tires along roadsides than wagon wheels The car has replaced the ConestogaI distrust a reductionism that sees causality as bottom up In what sense is Tomasina nothing but the atoms and their locations and motions in threedimensional space of which she was comprised The concepts of atoms in motion in threedimensional space do not appear to entail the concepts of an autonomous agent selfconsistent constraint construction release of energy propagating work tasks and the closure of catalysis tasks and other features that constitutes the propagating organization that is an autonomous agent or a coevolving ecology of autonomous agents In one sense of course there is nothing but the atoms in motion in threedimensionalspace in Tomasina But the historical coming into existence of life in the universe of autonomous agents and of the propagating organization that is Tomasina and her bioworld is nowhere accounted for by Newtons laws What after all do Newtons laws of motion have to do with a suYcient account of Tomasinas jump to the left rather than the right Is Tomasina as a whole organism part of the furniture of the universe YesAdaptations Exaptations and the Impossibility to Finitely Prestate the Configuration Space of a BiosphereOne contentious issue leads us to another And now I hope to trouble you deeplyTomasina was but one of many lineages of creatures evolving much as Darwin taught us by heritable variation and natural selection Lets turn to a Darwinian account of the function of the heart Roughly Darwin would say the function of the heart is to pump blood Namely Darwin would say this causal consequence of the heart is the virtue for which it was and persistently is selected by natural selection I tend to think Darwins account of the heart is correct Notice that the form of the account is ontological Hearts came into existence somehow and are sustained because it is advantageous to organisms to have a means to pump bloodBut the heart has other causal consequences For example the heart makes heart sounds as its valves open and close Presumably heart sounds are not the causal consequences of the heart upon which natural selection has acted Heart sounds are not the function of the heartIt is precisely this point that the function of a part of an organism is a subset of its causal consequences to which I appealed earlier in stating that in an autonomous agent discerning the work task done by the constrained release of energy required finding the subset of causal consequences of that work task that were functionally important to the life cycle of the autonomous agent in its environment and therefore were presumably selected and sustained by natural selection My point was that we cannot know the functions of parts except in the context of the whole autonomous agent in its environmentBut now we come to a more radical issue Darwinian preadaptations or in Stephen J Goulds term exaptations Darwin noted that in an appropriate environment a causal consequence of a part of an organism that had not been of selective significance might come to be of selective significance and hence be selected Thereupon that newly important causal consequence would be a new function available to the organismTake a fanciful case in point The human heart not only makes heart sounds but it also is a set of resonant chambers Suppose you were in Los Angeles felt something odd in your chest and thought My God An earthquake You did whatever the right thing was and survived alone among millions Your heart happened to be preadapted to pick up earthquake pretremors Now suppose you marry and have children who inherit your fatefully preadapted heart and suppose earthquakes arose often enough for this new capacity to oVer survival advantage to you and your oVspring Soon a subspecies of Homo sapiens would arise with earthquake detectors in their chest Not badNow evolution by such preadaptations or exaptations are not rare they are the grist of adaptive evolution Thus arose the lung the ear flight presumably most major adaptations and presumably many or even all minor ones as well It suYces for my purposes that many adaptations arise as Darwins preadaptations or Goulds exaptationsHere now is my troublesome question Do you think that you could state ahead of time all the possible causal consequences of bits and pieces of organisms that might in some odd circumstances or another turn out to be preadaptations and hence be selected and come to exist in the biosphere Stated more starkly do you think that you can finitely prestate all the contextdependent causal consequences of parts of all possible organisms that might be preadaptations hence be selected and come to exist in the biosphereI believe and it is a matter of central importance if I am correct that the answer is no I do not think it is possible to finitely prestate all the contextdependent causal consequences of parts of creatures that might turn out to be useful in some weird environment and hence be selected Im not yet certain how to prove that this is not possible although I will have a try at it belowAnother way of stating what I am driving at is this Is there a finitely prestatable set of all the possible potential biological functions Again I think the answer is no Yet another way of stating this is to say that there is no finite prestatement of the configuration space of a biosphere We cannot say ahead of time all the possible constellations of matter energy process and organization that is a kind of basis set for a biosphere in the sense that the atomic chart of the elements is a finite basis set for all of chemistryIt is time for a story A particularly ugly squirrel named Gertrude was atop a tree  years ago Gertrude was ugly because she had folds of skin from her forearms stretching to her hind limbs So ugly was Gertrude that she was shunned by the other squirrels and was sadly alone atop a magnolia tree eating lunch But just yards away high in a pine was Bertha an owl Bertha spotted Gertrude and thought Lunch Bertha flashed downward through shafts of light toward Gertrude Gertrude looked suddenly up and was terrified GAAAAAAH she cried and jumped in desperation from the top of the magnolia tree flinging her arms and legs wide in terrorAnd Gertrude flew Yes she flew away from the magnolia tree eluding the bewildered Bertha Later that month Gertrude was married in a civil ceremony to a handsome squirrel as she had become a heroine was no longer shunned and was considered a prize mate Her odd flaps turned out to be a consequence of a simple Mendelian dominant gene hence her kids had the same wondrous capacity to flyAnd that is how flying squirrels got their wings more or lessNow after the fact after Gertrude jumped in terror from the magnolia tree we would all say in wonder Did you see what Gertrude just did And we would tell the story of Gertrude But could we have said beforehand that Gertrudes ugly skin flaps would happen to be of use that day Perhaps perhaps not Could we have said it four billion years ago Or said it today about all possible future exaptations No Was some known law of physics violated by Gertrude NoNow a story about tractors It is said and I choose to believe it true that some engineers were hard at it trying to invent the tractor Good idea a tractor was the collective wisdom Needing lots of power the engineers began with a huge engine block and sought to mount the block on a chassis But the engine block was so massive that it crushed chassis after chassis The engineers were stumped Then one day one of the engineers said You know the engine block is so rigid we could use the engine block itself as the chassis and hang everything else oV the engine block And so thats how the tractor got its chassis And the chassis is just another Darwinian preadaptation or Gouldian exaptationA brief history of the origin of writing In the early Near East loans of sheep and goats were common The borrower would give the lender a small closed vessel of baked clay containing a number of stones equal to the number of borrowed sheep Upon return of the sheep the vessel would be broken open and the stones counted to make sure as many sheep were returned as had been borrowedBut sometimes the clay vessels were broken accidentally by the lender before the time of return of the sheep When the vessel was broken sometimes the stones would fall out and become lost The lender could not be sure he had recovered all his sheep So people started making scratch marks near the top of the vessel before they baked the clay to denote the number of stones placed inside the closed vessel One day it dawned on someone that with the scratch marks on the surface of the clay vessel the stones inside were not needed They smoothed the clay and began keeping notes of loaned sheep by marks baked into the clay Cuneiform writing beganDo you think you could finitely prestate all the contextdependent causal consequences of human artifacts that might turn out to be useful in some odd environment or for some odd purpose I dont think so It is not that we cannot finitely prestate some infinite things For example Fourier had a wonderful idea Sine and cosines you know he muttered to himself in French All possible wavelengths out to infinity down to infinitesimal all possible phase oVsets Haha And Fourier proved his theorem that any wiggly line on a plane surface could be approximated to arbitrary accuracy with a weighted set of phaseoVset sines and cosines drawn from the infinite basis set of all sine and cosine functions Fourier finitely prestated an infinite basis set for all continuous diVerentiable wiggly lines on long blackboardsBut can we finitely prestate all possible exaptations for all possible organisms or even the current organisms in our biosphere Again while Im still not certain how to prove my claim I claim the answer is no We cannot prestate the configuration space of the biosphere But notice our failure is not hindering the biosphere from exapting all the time Gertrude did it And every bacterium whose molecules wiggle in a useful way that turn out to detect a source of energy or danger or opportunity in some novel fashion tends to be selected for that novel functionality Look at the rate of emergence of bacteria resistant to our antibiotics and the myriad unexpected ways such resistance arises at the molecular level Who could have foretold the waysThe example of the common emergence of Darwinian preadaptations in the biosphere may point to an interesting connection with the diYculty Fontana and others have had achieving the persistent emergence of more complexity in algorithmic models such as alchemy and Tierra Gertrude did fly and thereby the capacity of her folds of skin to function as wings were selected Flying squirrels came to exist in the universe Restated a property of Gertrudeindeed here a collective property of her atomic constituentsmade itself manifest in the real physical world in a context that lent survival advantage to Gertrude Were we to have a formal algorithmic description of a formal simulated algorithmic Gertrude that did not have as an algorithmic consequence that her skin flaps might function as wings then the emergence of the higherorder category of winged squirrel could not be derived algorithmically Similarly were we to have a formal description of an engine block that did not include its rigidity we could not algorithmically derive that the engine block could be used as a chassisBut we might ask could we not have a complete physical description of Gertrude or the engine block such that all possible properties might be derived from that complete physical description The answer is almost certainly no It is an old philosophic realization that there is no finite description of a simple physical object in its context For example the coVee table in my living room is made of three wooden planks four short squat legs runners between all pairs of legs The middle board has a crack in it some eight inches long a quarter of an inch wide at the end of the board narrowing to nothing along a particular curved arc A second crack smaller is six inches from the first crack A cracker is on the table A personal computer is on the table The first crack is seven feet from the door The second crack is seven feet six inches from the door Both cracks are  miles from the moon and  light years from the nearest star A dead grasshopper is on the table to the left of the end of the first crack and about  light years from the nearest star A mote of dust hovers an inch above the table two inches from a leaf that drifts down from a ficus in the living roomYou get the sense that there is no complete description of the table Why does it matter Because I myself made an exaptation of which I am deeply proud You see I was worried one day that my wife or adult son might knock my PC oV the table so I wedged the power cord into the first crack and plugged the cord into a floor socket Thereby my PC worked on the table and couldnt be knocked oV easily You can understand my pride here as with my Rube Goldberg device to water my bean fieldBut even this tiny invention this tiny exaptation could not readily have been finitely prestated How would one in describing all the contextdependent features of the table happen to list the crack and its distance to the floor socket that happen to turn out to be relevant for my brilliant solution of a sudden problem In short there seems to be no finitely prestatable eVective procedure to list all the contextdependent features of objects and organs that might prove useful for some oddball purpose by some organism My invention the tractor invention the cuneiform invention and Gertrudes invention were all genuine novelties in the universeThis brings us to a wondrous set of issues You see we have indeed been taught by our physicist friends to do science by prestating the configuration space in question Consider our now rather tired example of statistical mechanics with Avogadros number of gas particles in a liter container First note that we can finitely specify ahead of time the Ndimensional configuration space of the gas that is all the positions and momenta of the N gas particles in threedimensionalspace inside the liter box Then Boltzmann assumed the ergodic hypothesis about wandering all over the configuration space did the calculations and lo statistical mechanics is upon usNow Newtonian mechanics Prestate the initial and boundary conditions the particles and force laws and with them the possible configuration space and calculate away So too in general relativity Given Einsteins equations prestate the initial and boundary conditions and seek solutions Solutions are possible universes The set of possible solutions is the configuration space allowed by general relativity And in quantum mechanics one talks of specifying the classical conditions of the experiment and thereby the configuration space of the quantum system preparing an initial state and using Schrdingers equation to propagate amplitudes for the entire future evolution in the configuration space for all conceivable observables Again in quantum mechanics in any specific context the configuration space is to be finitely prestatable then we follow the deterministic time evolution of the Schrdinger equation in configuration space square the resulting amplitudes to predict the probabilities of measurements and then carry out macroscopic measurements We know the configuration space ahead of timeBut what if we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere In that case the way Newton taught us to do science is not the whole story We cannot calculate as he did And in fact biologists do not often do science as Newton taught We carry on an odd mixture of historical analysis of the actual branching pathways of evolution a dollop of theory about evolutionary landscapes molecular evolution and coevolution and ecosystems and a lot of detailed experimental work to understand how actual creatures develop how their life cycles unfold how they assemble into ecosystems and so forthAnd biologists tell stories If I am right if the biosphere is getting on with it muddling along exapting creating and destroying ways of making a living then there is a central need to tell stories If we cannot have all the categories that may be of relevance finitely prestated ahead of time how else should we talk about the emergence in the biosphere or in our historya piece of the biosphereof new relevant categories new functionalities new ways of making a living These are the doings of autonomous agents Stories not only are relevant they are how we tell ourselves what happened and its significanceits semantic importIn short we do not deduce our lives we live them Stories are our mode of making sense of the contextdependent actions of us as autonomous agents And metaphor If we cannot deduce it all if the biospheres ramblings are richer than the algorithmic then metaphor must be part of our cognitive capacity to guide action in the absence of deductionIndeed in biology itself the narrative stance is gaining in popularity Did you see what Gertrude pulled oV Thats how flying squirrels evolved Dominant Mendelian gene you see easily selected once the right environmental conditions arose The propagating exapting biosphere is getting on with it and it appears that we crucially need stories to do some of the telling of that getting on with itHow odd C P Snow wrote of the two cultures science and the humanities never to mix Our inability to prestate the configuration space of a biosphere foretells a deepening of science a search for story and historical contingency yet a place for natural lawsForever CreativeIn this chapter I have been trying to say argue articulate the possibility that a biosphere is profoundly generativesomehow fundamentally always creative The cornerstone of this dawning near conviction lies in the belief I now hold with some confidence that we cannot finitely prestate the configuration space of a biosphere New variablesthe genetic code recombination Gertrudes wings writing the tractorpersistently emerge New language games and living games emerge What is the status of my claim that we cannot finitely prestate the configuration space of a biosphere I do think my claim is true But why I am not sure It is wise to explore some possible reasonsA first possibility is that the biosphere like a complex algorithm unfolds in ways that cannot be foretold Recall that for many algorithms the behavior of the algorithm cannot be prestated in any form more compressed than simply watching the program unfold The famous halting problem is the classic example For many algorithms that are to compute an answer then halt we cannot say ahead of time whether the computer will halt in finite timeI do not think the biosphere is akin to this diYculty with many algorithms If we consider such algorithms the building blocks of the algorithmsfor example the binary symbols  and  the operations of addition subtraction multiplication division exponentiation and root taking and control operations such as If such and such then do so and so otherwise do this and Do loopsare wellstated crisp mathematical primitives Our uncertainty about the unfolding of an algorithm does not lie in uncertainty about the primitives but about the consequences of the arrangements of these agreed upon primitives in a given computer code For example will the algorithm based on those primitives halt or not halt in finite timeBut among the exaptations in a biosphere are those that appear to alter the primitive objects and control operations Thus the evolution of chromosomes that replicate and partition to daughter cells the evolution of the genetic code and the evolution of controlled recombination all seem to be the evolution of the generative machinery of evolution itself Insofar as this is true our incapacity to prestate the configuration space of the biosphere is not a failure to prestate the consequences of the primitives it appears to be a failure to prestate the primitives themselvesLets consider the possibility that the incapacity to finitely prestate the configuration space of a biosphere is related to Godels theorem Godel demonstrated that for axiomatic systems as rich or richer than arithmetic given a set of axioms there were always statements that were true but not formally derivable from the axioms In addition Godel showed that it was always possible to enrich the axiom set and from that enriched axiom set it would be possible to prove the formally true but unprovable statements in the formal system On the other hand he also showed that the new enriched axiom system would itself have still further formally true but unprovable statementsI am not persuaded that the uncertainty about the configuration space of a biosphere is analogous to true but formally undecidable statements in a formal system I base this upon an analogy between formal proof and causal consequences The same parallel was pointed out by Robert Rosen in his book Life Itself If we are to represent causal consequences by a formal system then the concept of a proof derived by formal procedures from axiomsor more generally the concept of a trajectory in a state space where successive states along a trajectory are derived by a formal procedure such as integration of the diVerential equations representing the systemis the natural way to represent causal consequence If this parallelism is taken seriously then statements in a formal language that are true but unprovable in that formal language can have no causal pathwaythat is prooffrom the axioms to the desired consequence But this analogy seems to fail with respect to the evolution of the biosphere There is a perfectly fine causal account of Gertrude and her maiden flight We can reconstruct that account after the fact even if we could not have predicted it Thus it does not seem that our diYculty in prestating all exaptations is the same as the mathematical fact of formally undecidable statements in an axiom systemOn the other hand there may be a parallel between the exaptations of which we have spoken and Godels theorem and the augmentation of the axiom set such that formerly unprovable statements become provable That is the emergence of novel exaptations in evolution do seem rather like the emergence of novel primitive objects and primitive control operationshence novel axioms In the examples above the emergence of the genetic code and the emergence of chromosomes that duplicate and partition daughter chromosomes into two daughter cells the evolution of controlled recombination seem to become instantiated as biological laws even though they are entirely historically contingent Changing the biological laws in evolution seems rather like the generation of a novel axiom from which new consequences can be derivedOn this interpretation my claim that we cannot finitely prestate the configuration space of a biosphere becomes the claim that the biosphere keeps generating new causal axioms from which it generates novel forms Then just as we do not know where the new axioms of a formal system come from save as the free invention of the logician involved so it would seem that we cannot prestate the new generative exaptations that allow evolution to drive in new directions I am not entirely persuaded by this analogy to finding ever new axioms in Godels theorem but it does have some coherenceIndeed the failure to be able to prestate the configuration space of the biosphere may be yet deeper I will take a stab at a proof I begin by vitiating my assumption that one cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere then try to show that the implications are that the number of potentially relevant properties is vastly hyperastronomical and that there is no way in the lifetime of the universe for any knower within the universe to enumerate let alone work with all the possible properties or categories and their causal consequencesLets restrict attention to a model of a molecule a square  x  array of magnetic dipoles called spins that can point only up or down So our little system has  spins Thus I begin by vitiating my assertion and telling us what the configuration space is it has something to do with the spin configurations Well how many diVerent spin configurations are there Two raised to the th power Now what might we want to call a category or a property A sensible thought is that a category or class is some collection of the possible spin configurations say the configuration with all spins up plus all the configurations with no more than two spins down How many such possible classes are there The answer is the power set  raised to the  raised to the This is a gargantuan number It corresponds roughly to  raised to the  raised to the th That is the number of possible static categories of our tiny spin system is about  raised to the power written with  with  zeros after it By comparison the estimated number of particles in the known universe is about  raised to the th powerBut we have so far considered only static categoriespossible subsets of states of the spin system Suppose the spins can flip Then the spin system can pass from one configuration to another Suppose that the motions of the spin system are confined to closed cycles in the space of configurations that is simple orbits Each of our  to the  to the  static categories is a set of one or more spin configurations The number of possible orbits through that set is the factorial of the number of members of the set The number of orbits among configurations that constitute the power set of classes of the  spins is vastly larger than the number of static categoriesOn the other hand arbitrary motion among spin states may be unreasonable Instead the flow among spin configurations may be constrained by the energy couplings among the spins Physicists will properly talk of the Hamiltonian function that gives the energy of each spin configuration Grant such a Hamiltonian say a spinglass Hamiltonian where a spin glass is a disordered magnetic material Then the system at finite temperature may wander through the square root of its  states hence about  states in some complex patternsNow consider two such molecular systems each merely  x  spins each governed by a spinglass Hamiltonian function and let the two molecular systems interact in an aqueous medium As the two touch one another and jiggle near one another the coupled system performs some very complex dance of spin motions In general the equations describing that motion cannot be solved analytically but would have to be solved by numerical simulation That is there is no short description of the behavior of the system of equations they must instead be solved by an algorithmic system that follows the trajectory in the state space of the system by tiny incremental steps It becomes easy to conjure multimolecular systems indeed autonomous agents are examples in which even if the Hamiltonian for each single system and all the coupled systems were known it would not be possible to compute the detailed dynamics of the coupled spin system in the lifetime of the universeBut it is just such detailed wiggling by the coupled system that allows discovery of the preadaptation that a particular wiggling of one molecule senses a subset of states of another molecule and is useful for some survival purpose The behaviors of the collective set of molecules among the coevolving autonomous agents stumble upon then reinforce by heritable variation the odd molecular motions that capture photons that sense energy sources that are the finegrained molecular exaptations that are the daily stuV of evolutionWe cannot compute it There is a sense in which the computations are transfinitenot infinite but so vastly large that they cannot be carried out by any computational system in the universe Indeed one can consider the known radius of the universe at the Planck length and Planck timescale and can imagine all the events that have happened within any causally connected light cone that might therefore carry out a computation While vast there are combinatorial problems that are still vaster Presumably no physical process in the unfolding universe could have foreknowledge of all features of such problems Nor would there be an eVective procedure to prepare the cosmic computer in a proper initial state read in the data and read out its computationMy best bet is that the incapacity to finitely prestate the configuration space of a biosphere is deeply related to the incapacity to enumerate and predict all the possible detailed dynamics of coupled molecular systems by any computational system in the universe In turn this incapacity is I suspect deeply related to the gargantuan nonergodicity of the historical universe that I discuss in the next chapter And as we shall see in detail the exaptations of Gertrude and others leaves macroscopic living footprints propagating frozen accidents on the history of the universe The universe in its persistent becoming is richer than all our dreamings
