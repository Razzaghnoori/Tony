 Metabolife s Lawyer Assures C box He Won t Sue A warning to Chatterbox s critics in the Fray This item like its predecessor will not inform you about whether Metabolife s herbal diet suppliment is safe and effective or unsafe and ineffective If you want that kind of consumer information try this piece in Newsweek Chatterbox spent most of today continuing to quake with fear at the prospect of getting sued for doing precisely what Metabolife says it wants everyone in America to do Namely log on to its Web site As Chatterbox explained yesterday see Metabolife Read This No Wait Don t Read This Metabolife makes a diet pill that ABC News 20 20 is expected to report on in a forthcoming but as yet unscheduled report Believing that 20 20 is out to do a story that is both highly critical and unfair Metabolife put its own videotape of the unedited 20 20 interview on a special Web site and in an advertisement in the New York Times urged the public to compare that with what is actually broadcast when the program airs But when Chatterbox actually went to the Web site he was confronted by an elaborate user agreement that essentially threatened to sue anyone who used the information on the Web site for journalistic purposes Chatterbox then phoned Metabolife s public relations firm and was told to ignore the bullying legal language and proceed But Chatterbox wasn t going to do anything without talking to a lawyer He phoned Metabolife s attorney Steve Mansfield who works for Akin Gump in Los Angeles Did Mansfield intend to sue Chatterbox if he quoted from the Metabolife Web site I shouldn t be in a position of providing legal advice to you Mansfield said I don t think that s appropriate for you and for me Chatterbox explained that he couldn t very well take up Metabolife s invitation to consider the information it had gone to some expense to publicize without some assurance that Metabolife was not going to punish him for sharing said information with his readers Mansfield said he would have to check with the other lawyers and get back to Chatterbox When Mansfield phoned back he said You can certainly quote portions of the transcript under the fair use doctrine and you also can certainly take still frames make still frames of the videotaped interview under the fair use doctrine as well He said Chatterbox could also link to the Web site which was a great relief to hear because Chatterbox had already done that in the earlier item Mansfield declined however to tell Chatterbox what the rationale was behind all the legal mumbo jumbo on Metabolife s Web site or why Metabolife was according to its PR firm unwilling to let ABC News broadcast rivals help themselves to the unedited videotape of the 20 20 interview or how Metabolife could own the copyright on an interview conducted by someone else incorporating Chatterbox might have added audio fed to Metabolife from ABC s technicians To do so he said would violate attorney client privilege Chatterbox couldn t resist asking How much did Akin Gump charge Metabolife to write up the elaborate legal warning on its 20 20 Web site which he was now more or less telling Chatterbox to ignore I don t know what possible basis you would have for that question he said Was it more than 5 000 I m not going to respond to that Mansfield answered Mansfield called back a little later to tell Chatterbox that the legal language on the Metabolife Web site hadn t kept it from receiving more than a million hits on the first day it was up He also said that if Slate was going to criticize the legal terminology on Metabolife s Web site it ought to acknowledge its own much lengthier more intimidating set of disclaimers that goes on page after page after page Chatterbox had no idea what Mansfield was talking about which should give you some idea about how little prominence Slate s table of contents page gives these terms of use look for the teensy blue type at the very bottom Mansfield acknowledged Slate s growly legal language was much harder to find but said that when you read it it was frankly more ominous than Metabolife s growly legal language Well judge for yourself Chatterbox thinks that the few obsessives who wander onto this page which enunciates terms of use for all Microsoft Web sites and not just Slate will realize that Slate is out to protect its published material from being stolen or plagiarized but like every other publication in the world on the Web or elsewhere is more than happy to have its published material quoted in accordance with fair use By now it was dinnertime and Mrs Chatterbox and the Chatterchildren were urging Chatterbox to come home Chatterbox will report on his visit to Metabolife s Web site tomorrow
