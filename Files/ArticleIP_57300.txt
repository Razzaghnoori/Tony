 The Season for Giving Now that the bustle of the holiday season is officially underway it appears that the residents of Tabloidland have been getting busy if you know what we mean There s been a serious explosion of ardor in the pages of the tabs with celebrities of all stripes doing their very best bunny rabbit imitations Tabloid staple Celine Dion for one plans to make love like there s no tomorrow according to the National Enquirer With her husband manager Rene Angelil s cancer in remission Dion is taking a much needed career hiatus to focus on getting pregnant a plan that supposedly includes spending time puttering around the kitchen because it makes her feel maternal Although the Enquirer concedes that Angelil s treatment may have affected his fertility a joyful Dion says she ll give it the old college try Rene and I are lovers like we ve never been before and we plan to spend all our free time in bed she s quoted as saying Also reportedly spending a lot of free time in bed is sassy Latin talk show queen Cristina Saralegui The Globe says that Saralegui s second husband musician Marcos Avila is an adventurer in love who awaken ed her to the joys of sex Saralegui waxes poetic about her husband s marvelously sensual and virile nature and is particularly wowed by his toe sucking prowess For a woman who grew up in a convent school to have someone suck your toes is an amazing sexual experience Saralegui explains Keeping Tabs didn t go to convent school but we ll take her word for it And the picture of domestic bliss she paints Positively charming When we get home exhausted from taping once I take off my false eyelashes and we crawl into bed Marcos says Give me some lovin and I do Is there something in the water The National Enquirer reports that as Ren e Zellweger and Jim Carrey checked in for a romantic weekend at the Stonepine Resort in Carmel Valley Calif she was giggling as he whispered in her ear They rented two rooms but occupied just one and hardly ever left it smirks the Enquirer While Keeping Tabs was particularly fond of the Enquirer headline announcing that Cameron Diaz Likes Loud Sex Hates Matt Dillon she was duly impressed that the Globe s prurient interests managed to extend even to the great beyond They report that the late Bette Davis relieved her frustrations during the shooting of the 1944 film Mr Skeffington by romping in the proverbial hay with director Vincent Sherman She d be fine for five days then would tighten up again Sherman explains We d have another evening together The only tabloid types not scoring this week it seems are those on higher moral ground Avowing their virginity are tennis player Anna Kournikova I do not let anyone even have a peek into my bed and singer Enrique Iglesias who s said to be waiting for the right woman Good for you Enrique coos the Globe s Charlene Tilton In a story titled Richard Simmons Sad Lonely Life the Globe reports that the flamboyant exercise guru prefers food to sex which he says is overrated Meanwhile Lola Falana now a devoted Christian who spends much of her time at a Carmelite monastery in Las Vegas tells the Globe she s been celibate for years When they re not having constant sex or actively refraining from it celebs seem to be busy entertaining flirtatious schoolgirl crushes on one another We re not sure if Jim Carrey knows it but the Globe says that Ren e Zellweger has a huge infatuation with Paul McCartney while the Star reports that Britney Spears has a major crush on Britain s Prince William and even tried to ply him with provocative photos showing off her famous curves But then again she really is a schoolgirl so maybe that s all right Perhaps the strangest mutual admiration society is that between President Bill Clinton and the famously curvy queen of soul Aretha Franklin The Star says that the two traded saucy mash notes behind the scenes at this year s White House Correspondents Dinner ferried between them no less by a young red headed intern Hillary Clinton has reportedly long been suspicious about her husband s fixation on Franklin and once had to elbow him in the stomach to get him to stop staring at her unbelievable cleavage during a White House concert It s apparently all in the cleavage According to the Globe Mrs Clinton s recent display of her own d colletage was actually a pronouncement about the state of her marriage That revealing new wardrobe and snazzy haircut are a dead giveaway that it s just a matter of time before she divorces the president Whenever women really change their hairstyle dramatically the Globe explains they re maybe looking to change their romantic life too Watch out Finally the Globe says that both Jennifer Love Hewitt and George Michael are crushed out on swivel hipped Ricky Martin The Enquirer concurs reporting that Michael is smitten with the Latin heartthrob and is particularly taken with his smile Meanwhile the Star which also labels Martin swivel hipped investigates the possibility that the singer might be gay with all the meticulousness of a Supreme Court proceeding On one hand there is the incriminating fact that Martin wouldn t do anything to his five bedroom all white Miami Beach pad without the advice of his decorator on the other singer Alejandra Guzm n insists that Martin s moves are as great as his kisses and dancer Adriana de Biega claims that her night of lovemaking with Martin was pure magic Keeping Tabs can only wonder if there was toe sucking involved
