 Harmonic Convergences You re right Maxim s strong point is that it s totally unsentimental and ungenteel It s a sendup of the old model but in a different way than say Hustler was and the difference surprise reflects the sexual culture of the 90s With its belligerent grossness and misogyny Hustler rebelled against the establishment men s mags class condescension the earnest philosophizing about the sexual revolution the thinking men s sex bomb syndrome at the same time that it was deliberately goading feminists It came right out with the anger that the regular men s mags tried to hide Maxim pokes fun at its progenitors but with considerable ironic affection It s not angry In fact while its fondness for the most idiotic juvenile humor knows no bounds any strong emotion is taboo unless you count horror at having your penis mangled that s part of the British influence I guess And feminism isn t an issue at least not directly partly because its basic ideas have been assimilated and are taken for granted partly because politics in general and feminism in particular barely exist in the consciousness of Maxim s age group Whereas Gear which retains certain elements of the old men s mag ethos and the old hostility and not incidentally runs somewhat longer articles does worry about and argue with feminism as in its recent piece on sexual repression in the military in which it is argued after a fashion that 1 we can t suppress male soldiers urge to rape and harass women without suppressing the urge to kill that s the military s reason for being 2 sexual harassment crusades interfere with women s equality 3 women soldiers aren t men s equals anyway and 4 why do we need women in the military in the first place Another thing I ve noticed is that the trajectory of the new men s magazines and that of contemporary women s magazines seem to be converging at least compared with 20 years ago There used to be an enormous gulf between the sense of entitlement to the good things of life including women that pervaded the men s mags and women s anxious obsession with self improvement in order to be worthy of male attention In young women s magazines now Cosmo being the paradigm there s a much more bluntly instrumental male attitude toward getting sex of the quantity and quality desired Beauty is as central a preoccupation as ever if anything more so but the preoccupation has much more of a narcissistic self pampering quality and less of a desperation to make up for some irrecoverable primal imperfection In the men s magazines there s much more of a sense that if you want women to give you the time of day you have to make some effort to find out what they want and give it to them In the old model if men needed advice on women or sex they got it from a male expert like the Playboy Advisor Now Maxim features advice from women on such matters as how not to give the wrong impression on a first date On the other hand men still don t like to express anxiety directly I d guess that part of the reason men s mags have gotten sillier is that they ve seized on men s time honored method of covering up insecurity by clowning around Regarding your suggestion that these magazines give men a safe place to be together without their heterosexuality being questioned That sounds like more of a hope on their part than a reality Because it s ultimately self doubt that really matters no place can really be safe hence the need to escalate the jokes
