 Background RNA viruses are important pathogens in humans animals and plants Their short generation time and high mutation rates allow them to adapt rapidly to changing environmental conditions and make them ever changing targets for anti viral therapies or vaccinations RNA viruses form highly polymorphic clouds of mutants so called quasispecies 1 2 3 At viral loads of 10 8or more virions in an infected host viral quasispecies in vivo often contain all possible single point mutants from the consensus sequence as well as a sizeable fraction of two or three point mutants 4 Besides their importance as pathogens RNA viruses have in recent years also become one of the main tools for experimental verification of theoretical population genetics and evolutionary theory in general reviewed in 3 This line of research can draw on a substantial body of literature on the theory of quasispecies dynamics and its relation to standard population genetics 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 The quasispecies theory has been useful to understand RNA virus evolution but the assumptions underlying the model do not always reflect the biology of RNA viruses In some instances the original model has been corrected to account for discrepancies such as infinite vs finite population sizes 7 9 16 However other factors need to be considered as well For instance the standard quasispecies model assumes low multiplicity of infection m o i that is each cell is assumed to be infected by at most one virion At high m o i when several virions coinfect a single cell the virions can recombine 17 18 19 or reassort for segmented viruses 20 21 22 23 24 25 Second the model assumes that the genotype of a virion fully determines its fitness However this assumption is not always justified since many viral functions can be provided in trans an effect referred to as complementation Thus the phenotype of a virion may not reflect its genotype 26 27 28 29 Phenotypic mixing and hiding is a particular case of complementation involving surface proteins above citations It occurs either at high m o i when two or more different mutants or virus strains freely exchange genetic sequences and surface proteins inside a cell or at low m o i when a mutant offspring is encapsidated by its parent s proteins No general theory is available for the evolutionary dynamic of a viral quasispecies under the influence of virus density as it changes with changing m o i However some particular cases have been studied 30 31 32 mostly related to recombination and reassortment 33 34 35 36 and to the dynamic of defective interfering particles 37 38 39 40 41 In this paper we modify the quasispecies model by incorporating phenotypic hiding between wild type virus and a deleterious mutant We assume that the mutant differs from the wild type in a surface protein necessary for cell entry so that the fitness difference between two virions is solely determined by the surface proteins and not by the particular genomes they carry We show that phenotypic hiding of the mutant genome behind wild type capsids increases the mutant frequency above the level predicted by the standard quasispecies model This increase in mutant frequency is most pronounced at high m o i but exists also at very low m o i Moreover we show that the decrease of mutant frequency from an initially high level down to the level of mutation selection balance is slowed down substantially at high m o i because of phenotypic hiding We propose that our model may explain some of the quantitative differences observed between theoretical predictions of the quasispecies model and experimental data published in the literature 42 43 44 45 Foot and mouth disease virus FMDV has been one of the most productive models of viral quasispecies dynamics reviewed in 46 FMDV belongs to the Picornaviridea family It has a non segmented positive strand genome of approximately 8 5 Kb encapsidated by viral proteins VP1 VP2 VP3 and VP4 A conserved Arginine Glycine Aspartic acid RGD triplet in G H loop of VP1 recognizes the v 3 v 6 or v 1 integrin as viral receptor reviewed in Ref 47 the first necessary step for virus entry Work carried out with different RGD virus mutants and mimic peptides 48 49 50 51 52 clearly demonstrates the critical role that the RGD triplet has in virus entry and its little tolerance to variation Among the few RGD mutants that have been isolated on is RED a low fitness mutant in which the glycine is replace by glutamic acid 53 Ru z Jarabo and co workers found that after revertant RGD genomes became dominant and mutant genomes were no longer detected in the consensus sequence RED was able to remain in the population for very long times and at surprisingly high frequencies 42 43 44 45 There is a qualitative agreement between the predictions of the quasispecies model and this result but there is also a quantitative discrepancy RED memory genomes can be observed at much higher frequency than expected However phenotypic hiding promotes a decelerated decay of mutant genomes in the population and this decelerated decay could be interpreted as a memory effect in agreement with the results by Ru z Jarabo et al The research design of the original work 42 43 44 45 does not allow us to conclusively accept or reject our model as the correct explanation for their observations but the values of mutant frequencies predicted by our model are consistent with the experimental data Model We assume that the virus is propagated under serial transfer and model the change in mutant concentrations from passage to passage We assume that the difference between wild type and mutant lies in the capsid proteins such that the mutation affects the ability of the virus to enter a cell but not the viability of the virus inside the cell Under phenotypic mixing and hiding there are four types of virions that can occur wild type genotype with wild type phenotype wild type genotype with mutant phenotype mutant genotype with wild type phenotype and mutant genotype with mutant phenotype We will call virions whose genotype coincides with their phenotype as pure and virions for which genotype and phenotype do not coincide as mixed In the following paragraphs we outline the derivation of a set of deterministic equations that describe the change in relative concentrations of the different pure and mixed virions in an infinite virus population More details are given in the Methods section Our model is similar to models studied by Szathm ry 38 39 The probability p ww that an offspring virion is pure wild type is p ww 1 r x w r Methods section Eq 14 where x w is the probability with which a particular virion that infects a cell contains the wild type genome and r is a parameter related to the multiplicity of infection Likewise the probabilities p wm and p mw that an offspring virion is mixed of either type are p wm p mw rx w x m Eq 15 where x m 1 x w and the probability p mm that an offspring virion is pure mutant is p mm 1 r x m r The formula that relates the parameter r to the multiplicity of infection Eq 13 is somewhat unwieldy For reference and in order to provide an intuitive meaning for r we have tabulated r which we will call in the following also the mixing parameter versus the m o i in Table 1 The probabilities x w and x m depend on the composition of the types of free virions on infection Assume that y ww is the concentration of pure wild type virions at passage t y wm that of mixed virions with wild type genotype and mutant phenotype y mw that of mixed virions with mutant genotype and wild type phenotype and y mm that of pure mutant virions Further assume that virions with wild type phenotype infect cells at a rate w while virions with mutant phenotype infect at a rate m w Then the total rate at which cells are infected with wild type genomes is w y ww m y wm Likewise the total rate at which cells are infected with mutant genomes is w y mw m y mm Therefore we have x w w y ww m y wm m y wm y mm The probability x m follows from x m 1 x w Using the various formulas given in the previous two paragraphs we find that the virion concentrations at passage t 1 primed quantities are given by We now introduce mutations into this model We assume that the wild type mutates into the mutant with probability For simplicity we assume that back mutations occur at the same rate It is safe to make this assumption because the rate of back mutations from deleterious to advantageous mutants tends to have little effect on mutation selection balance Mutations will typically not affect the phenotype of the offspring virion which is determined by the distribution of mutant or wild type capsid proteins in the cell The extended model with mutations therefore becomes Results Extinction of mutant for 0 In order to evaluate whether the mutant can coexist with the wild type or will ultimately go extinct if it is not constantly regenerated through mutations we have to analyze the fixed points of Eqs 1a 1d There are two trivial fixed points corresponding to the cases in which all virions are either pure wild type or pure mutant We could not find any non trivial fixed points Since the expressions involved are extremely unwieldy we searched for non trivial fixed points only numerically using the function NSolve of Mathematica 54 A linear expansion around the fixed points tells us whether the mutant can invade an established wild type population or vice versa If we introduce a small amount of mutant virions into an established wild type population the total amounts of wild type genomes Y w y ww y wm and mutant genomes Y m y mm y mw after the next passage become to first order in As long as m w 1 as we assume throughout this paper the amount of mutant genomes in the population decreases in the first passage which implies that the mutant cannot invade Likewise if we introduce a small amount of wild type virions into an established mutant population the total amounts of mutant and wild type genomes after the next passage become to first order in In this case the amount of the invading wild type genomes in the population increases which implies that the wild type can invade an established mutant population The invasion of a mutant population by a small amount of wild type virions is shown in Fig 1 The preceeding analysis shows that Eqs 1a 1d have only a single stable fixed point the one in which the whole population consists of pure wild type virions The mutant will therefore always go extinct eventually The rate at which the mutant disappears depends on the m o i Figure 2shows the ratio between mutant and wild type concentrations as a function of passage for various m o i Concentrations are measured with respect to the genotype that is mutant and wild type concentrations are Y m and Y w respectively In the example given we have m w 0 3 At low m o i the mutant to wild type ratio drops from 1 at passage zero to values of 10 2and lower after four passages At high m o i the reduction in mutant concentration proceeds much slower For example at an m o i of three the mutant to wild type ratio is only 10 1after four passages An interesting aspect of Fig 2is that the reduction in mutant frequency during the first passage is independent of the m o i This effect is a consequence of our assumption that the mutant has impaired ability of cell entry In the first round of infection when all virions are pure wild type or pure mutant the mutant virions cannot benefit from phenotypic hiding Therefore their frequency will decrease corresponding to the true fitness difference to the wild type independent of the m o i From the second passage onward the balance between pure and mixed virions is established and further reduction of the mutant frequency is slowed down at high m o i Figure 3shows the individual concentrations of the various pure and mixed virions at an m o i of five We observe that the concentration of pure mutant virions decreases much faster than that of mixed virions with mutant genomes After ten passages both concentrations are equal and after fifty passages there are more than twice as many mixed virions with mutant genomes than there are pure mutant virions When the mutant is rare it is mostly hiding behind wild type capsids which slows down its extinction Interestingly the fraction of mutant genomes encapsidated with wild type protein is equal to the fraction of wild type genomes encapsidated with mutant protein at zero mutation rate This symmetry is a consequence of the symmetry of equations 1b and 1c and disappears for 0 Mutation selection balance for positive We now turn to the general case of a positive mutation rate We first consider the case of vanishingly low m o i r 0 When we set r 0 Eq 2 becomes the discrete time version of a model of maternal effects in quasispecies evolution 55 In Ref 55 the fitness of a virion is assumed to be the product of a contribution from the genotype of the virion s parent and one from the virion s own genotype The situation here is simpler because we assume that fitness is only determined by the phenotype efficiency of cell entry In the language of Ref 55 this means we have b i 1 for all genotypes i From Eqs 5 and 6 in Ref 55 we obtain the steady state concentrations of pure and mixed virions neglecting back mutations from mutant to wild type We mentioned in the previous section that y wm y mw for 0 Clearly this symmetry does not exist for 0 For 0 1 the ratio in concentration of the two classes of mixed virions is y mw y wm 1 m w 1 There will typically be several orders of magnitude more mutant genomes encapsidated in wild type protein than wild type genomes encapsidated in mutant protein Note however that this result holds only under the assumption of vanishingly low m o i As the m o i increases the mixed virions with mutant genomes will still be at higher concentration than the mixed virions with wild type genomes but the ratio between the two will be much smaller than 1 The ratio of mixed virions with mutant genomes to pure mutant virions is y mw y mm 1 m w 1 at low m o i that is there are more pure virions than mixed virions with mutant genomes in equilibrium We found numerically that at high m o i this relationship is reversed and there are substantially more mixed than pure mutants For the total amount of mutant genomes in the population we obtain after summing Eqs 5c and 5d For comparison the standard quasispecies model without phenotypic hiding predicts This expression is equivalent to the one given by Ru z Jarabo et al in their analysis of quasispecies memory 44 Equations 6 and 7 differ only in the factor 2 1 m w This factor is larger than one for small mutation rates that is as long as 1 m w 2 8 If the mutant has a substantial fitness disadvantage in comparison to the wild type say at least 10 then will always be small enough to satisfy this condition Therefore phenotypic hiding will lead to an increase in mutant genomes even at low m o i The increase is at most a factor of two for 1 and m w 1 in comparison to the prediction of the standard quasispecies model For the case of positive mutation rate and high m o i there is no analytic solution available and we have to resort to numerical simulations Figure 4shows the decay of mutant genomes over time starting from an initial state where mutant and wild type are present in equal concentrations We have displayed trajectories for a wide range of m o i and we have also displayed the corresponding trajectory generated by the standard quasispecies model All trajectories show the same qualitative behavior The mutant frequency decays quickly during the initial passages and then levels off in mutation selection balance As discussed in the previous paragraphs the level of mutant genomes in mutation selection balance is always higher in our model than in the standard quasispecies model Moreover the level of mutant genomes increases with increasing m o i The initial decay of mutant genomes is also influenced by the m o i and slows down with increasing m o i In general the initial decay of mutant genomes for 0 is identical to the one for 0 as described in the previous subsection It is interesting to note that phenotypic hiding influences the equilibrium concentration of mutant genomes at low m o i but not the speed at which equilibrium is attained The initial decay of mutant genomes is identical for our model at low m o i and for the standard quasispecies model Discussion Ru z Jarabo et al measured the frequency of the minority FMDV RED mutant up to passage 50 and found that the frequency was still declining at passage 50 44 They observed mutant frequencies at passage 50 between 6 6 10 4and 10 3 These results are in agreement with our model of phenotypic hiding if we use a relative fitness of 0 4 for the RED mutant as compared to the wild type 42 44 and assume that 1 the fitness disadvantage is fully explained by impaired entry 2 the mutation rate is 10 4 and 3 the m o i is approximately five Fig 4 The m o i in Ref 44 was between one and five Ru z Jarabo et al noted that mutant concentrations around 10 3would follow from equilibrium state of the standard quasispecies model if the mutation rate were 10 3rather than 10 4 However the standard quasispecies model predicts that the mutation selection balance should be reached around passage 10 Fig 4 which is at odds with the observation that the frequency of RED mutants continued to decline up to passage 50 It is important to note that capsid proteins can be provided in trans during the production of infectious FMDV particles 51 and phenotypic hiding has been known for many years in a variety of picornaviruses 56 57 58 Other factors may enhance or reduce the effects of complementation For instance compartimentalization or physical localization should prevent to some degree the free exchange of genomes and products In order to test fully the predictions of our model we would need data on the decay of the mutant frequency from replicate populations propagated at different m o i Unfortunately such data does not exist Although Ru z Jarabo et al propagated their populations at an m o i of 0 1 in their initial study 42 and at an m o i between one and five in their follow up study 44 we cannot compare the mutant frequencies reported in these two studies because the method of screening for RED mutants was changed in the follow up study 44 Table 1 Note b Moreover a caveat applies to the comparison of the experimental data to our model Ru z Jarabo et al determined the frequency of RED mutants by first screening for monoclonal antibody MAb SD6 resistant virions and then determining the fraction of RED mutants among them from sequence data While this method successfully prevents against counting MAb resistant mutants that are not RED it does not measure the fraction of RED mutants that hide behind RGD capsids If phenotypic hiding plays an important role in this system then the fraction of hiding RED mutants could be substantial and the reported mutant frequencies would likely represent underestimates In summary the experimental data are consistent with our model but do not allow us to either accept or reject it with certainty We have shown in the present paper that phenotypic hiding can increase equilibrium frequencies by factors of two to five or even higher for high m o i It is conceivable that other types of complementation can have similar effects 59 Phenotypic hiding can bias fitness determinations if the phenotype rather than the genotype is quantified This bias occurs simply because a fraction of mutant genomes will hide behind wild type envelopes and will be missed an effect that has been previously reported 29 60 As a byproduct of our study we predict two phases of mutant frequency decay specific to phenotypic hiding In the first round of infection all virions are pure wild type or pure mutant so that the mutant virions cannot benefit from complementation Therefore their frequency will decrease corresponding to their true fitness and independently of the m o i From the second passage onward the balance between pure and mixed virions is established and further reduction of the mutant frequency proceeds much slower if the m o i is sufficiently high as illustrated in Figure 2 As a consequence if fitness competitions are halted after the first passage measurements of the phenotype will not bias fitness determinations These effect should not be observed in other forms of complementation but should be characteristic of any situation in which the phenotype is determined by envelope proteins Host range will often belong to this category since receptor recognition is one of its main determinants Other examples include antibody resistant mutants and escape mutants when the antiviral drug targets entry such as rimantidine and amantidine resistant influenza strains or WIN compound resistant picornaviruses 61 Thus phenotypic hiding can keep a relatively large frequency of mutants in the absence of selective pressure that can provide a quick response when such selective pressure is restored Complementation can also complicate the interpretation of other experimental results involving competition between two or more strains For instance Miralles et al 62 63 tested the effect of clonal interference in VSV populations by changing the population size in competitions between wild type and a MARM mutant This MARM mutant carries a point mutation that confers resistance to I1 Mab but it is neutral otherwise 64 Clonal interference occurs in asexual organisms when population sizes are large enough to allow the simultaneous generation of more than one advantageous mutation so that the best mutation has to compete not only with an inferior wild type but also with the other fitter mutants 65 Thus while the best possible mutation should always be the one becoming dominant the rate at which it does so should be slowed down in large populations The VSV competition experiments were carried out at increasing viral population sizes but the number of infected cells was held constant that is the m o i was increased alongside the population size Therefore complementation may also have contributed to the slowdown of the speed of adaptation at large population sizes and the relative contributions of complementation and clonal interference to the slowdown would be hard to disentangle The only phenotypic hiding effect that the authors could avoid were related to the determination of changes in MARM C frequencies and these only correlate to the changes in beneficial mutation frequencies if the beneficial mutation mapped to the G glycoprotein Many infections in plants and animals are probably initiated by one or few viral particles thus corresponding to a situation of low m o i As replication proceeds and titers rise the likelyhood of coinfection increases The best evidence for multiple infections in vivo comes from the observation of natural recombinants In the case of HIV 1 for instance rampant recombination has been reported even among different subtypes 66 67 and the number of proviruses per cell was estimated to be approximately three Another well known example is influenza virus for which reassortment is a major mechanism of evolutionary change 68 As in the case of HIV reassortment depends of coinfection and once coinfection occurs complementation is as likely to ensue as reassortment Conclusions We have shown that phenotypic hiding has substantial influence on the equilibrium frequencies of mutants in selection mutation balance and on the speed at which deleterious mutants are lost from the population Our theory makes five predictions that can be tested experimentally 1 The rate at which the mutant disappears should decrease and the equilibrium concentration of the mutant should increase with increasing m o i 2 A substantial fraction of mutant genomes should be encapsidated with wild type protein 3 The ratio of mutant genomes encapsidated in wild type protein to wild type genomes encapsidated in mutant protein should decrease with increasing m o i 4 Even at low m o i the fraction of mutant present in mutation selection balance should be larger up to a factor of two than predicted by the standard quasispecies model if the mutant fitness is low compared to the wild type fitness 5 The decrease of mutant frequency during the first passage should be independent of the m o i and equal to that measured for later passages at very low m o i Future experiments can be designed to test these predictions and can thereby clarify whether phenotypic hiding is a major contributor to viral memory and elevated equilibrium frequencies of mutants Methods In this section we present some calculations that form the basis of the derivation of our model equations We first calculate the probability that a virion produced by an n fold coinfected cell is pure Assume a cell is infected by k virions with wild type genotype and by n k virions with mutant genotype Then the probability that an offspring virion is pure wild type is the probability that it has wild type genotype which is k n times the probability that it has wild type phenotype which is again k n Thus the total probability is k n 2 If we want to know the probability that an offspring virion is pure for a number of coinfected cells with different ratios in their multiplicity of infection of wild type and mutant genotypes then we have to sum over the different contributions of all the individual cells In practice we will not know exactly which cells are infected with what virions However it is reasonable to assume that we know the overall probabilities with which cells are infected with either mutant or wild type genotype Assume that x w is the probability that a cell is infected with wild type genotype and x m 1 x w likewise for the mutant genotype Then the number of wild type genomes k in a cell is binomially distributed and therefore the overall probability ww n that an offspring virion from a cell infected by n virions is pure wild type becomes 38 Likewise we find for the probability mm n that an offspring virion is pure mutant mm n x w x m n Now we consider mixed virions Assume again that a cell is infected by k virions with wild type genotype and by n k virions with mutant genotype In analogy to the considerations for a pure virion we find that the probability of a mixed virion is k n k n 2 regardless of whether the genotype is wild type and the phenotype is mutant or vice versa The probabilities wm n and mw n that an offspring virion is mixed of either type are then Equations 9 and 10 are valid if all cells have exactly the same multiplicity of infection However infection is a Poisson process and some cells will end up being infected by more virions than other cells Assume that is the multiplicity of infection of the whole population Then the probability that a single infected cell is infected by k virions is e k 1 e k The factor 1 e in the denominator corrects for the e cells that will not be infected at all We obtain the overall probabilities to find a pure or mixed offspring virion by summing over all possible combinations of infections with their respective probabilities For example After taking the sum we find p ww cx w x m 12 where the constant c is given by Here Ei z is the exponential integral and is the Euler constant 0 577216 Finally by making use of x w 1 x m we arrive at p mm cx w 1 c 14 Similarly for a mixed virion we find We obtain p mm and p mw from Eqs 14 and 15 by interchanging w and m in all subscripts Equations 14 and 15 show that the mixing parameter r used in the main body of this paper is related to c via r 1 c Authors
