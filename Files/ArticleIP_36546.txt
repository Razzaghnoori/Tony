 Gore s Debate Bait For nearly a year while Bill Bradley labored to be taken seriously as a presidential candidate Al Gore studiously ignored him Last weekend after Bradley surged past him in the fund raising contest and in New Hampshire polls Gore turned and opened fire At an Iowa Democratic Party dinner Gore challenged Bradley to debate him once a week How about it Bill Gore taunted looking straight at Bradley If the answer is yes stand up and wave your hand Bradley sat on his hands and the press reported excitedly that the momentum in the Democratic race had shifted The debate challenge has changed the game by advancing several of Gore s strategic objectives 1 Kill Bradley s momentum For months Gore has bled money and support while Bradley has gained on him In basketball when one team makes this kind of run the other team s coach calls a timeout to defuse the hot team s momentum and ruin its rhythm before the game gets out of hand Since the strategy Gore had mapped out before the game has already been defeated and discarded he has nothing to lose by tearing up his schedule to make room for debates Bradley s game plan however has been highly effective and he has much to lose by being derailed from it Even if Bradley ignores the challenge it has supplanted his message as the campaign s hot story Every headline coming out of the Iowa dinner focused on Gore s challenge and ignored Bradley s good speech 2 Reverse the expectations game Gore has suffered from being perceived as the spoiled stagnant front runner He wants as Slate s Jacob Weisberg has to restyle himself as the underdog And what does an underdog do He dares the front runner to debate him The debate challenge helps persuade the media to cast Gore in this unlikely role Gore gave a scrappy speech in Iowa and offered himself as a feisty underdog reported the New York Times Bradley may no longer have the luxury of trying to be above politics and repeated debates 3 Change the subject from character to issues While Gore has appealed for support on the basis of his platform Bradley has appealed for support on the basis of his character and life story So far Bradley s biography has trumped Gore s issues Debates which are organized around issues rather than personal history would force Bradley to play Gore s game Since polls show that many voters who like Bradley don t know his positions on the issues he stands to lose some of his support by having to spell out his views By pushing the contest in this direction Gore s challenge has already poisoned media coverage of Bradley The inability of many New Hampshire voters to identify Bradley s positions on major issues could loom as a vulnerability says the Times 4 Make Bradley address losing issues Every candidate has issues on which he expects to win votes and issues on which he expects to lose votes The rule is to talk about your winning issues and avoid your losing issues Bradley s winning issues are campaign reform health care and gun control Gore wants to make him talk about three losing issues Reaganomics which hurts Bradley among Democrats because he voted for Reagan s 1981 budget cuts vouchers Bradley s past support of pilot voucher programs offends powerful teachers unions and Democratic voters who think vouchers threaten public schools and ethanol Bradley s past opposition to ethanol subsidies irks Iowans who count on these subsidies to prop up farmers For Michael Kinsley s take on Bradley s inconsistency on the ethanol question click This is why Gore specifically dared Bradley to debate him in Iowa on agriculture Bradley can answer Gore s criticisms in interviews he has already begun to do so but politically Bradley loses votes and momentum just by having to address these troublesome issues instead of his winners 5 Recast Gore as a fighter For months the media have depicted Gore as stiff imperial and out of touch Bradley has played along calling Gore timid and associating him with entrenched power By daring Bradley to debate him Gore confounds this characterization Gore s refrain in his Iowa speech stay and fight excited the pundits as well as the crowd The Times said Gore s call to arms conveyed passion and suggested focus and purpose The Washington Post reported Gore sprang to life tonight delivering one of his feistiest performances of the year A Times headline ventured Notion of a New Al Gore Begins to Take Root 6 Recast Bradley as a coward For the preceding reasons Bradley has no strategic interest in debating Gore He didn t budge when Gore urged him to stand and accept the challenge and Bradley s aides brushed it aside saying there would be plenty of debates down the road But if Bradley keeps declining the challenge Gore will turn the timidity argument against him For weeks with increasing explicitness Gore has accused Bradley of walking away from the fight by voting for Reagan s 1981 budget opposing farm subsidies and retiring from Congress after Republicans took full control in 1995 Gore s surrogates have accused Bradley of quitting and running from battles The media smell a new target By refusing to engage Bradley opens himself up to being portrayed as a risk averse aloof politician who does not have the mettle to fight emphatically for the nomination said the Times Will he hold up as a high minded candidate asked the Post or will he be seen as just another politician who has gone wobbly on his party on crucial fights 7 Seize the high ground Bradley dismisses Gore s criticisms as darts I am simply not going to get into dealing with the darts that are being thrown he says I think the American people want to have a positive vision of the future This rebuttal might have worked but the debate challenge has thwarted it and has jeopardized Bradley s posture as a straight talking idealist Questioning your opponent s courage looks cynical but calling for debates looks noble Conversely refusing to answer your opponent s insults looks noble but refusing to answer a debate challenge looks cynical Gore is using his debate challenge as moral cover for his attacks on Bradley s character and the media are turning their scrutiny on Bradley s defensiveness instead In his speech Bradley handed Gore the perfect metaphor to make this point baseball s home run derby between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa Why can t it be Vice President Al Gore pushing Bill Bradley and Bill Bradley pushing Al Gore to be the best we can be Bradley asked Gore proceeded to hit this pitch out of the park telling the crowd that if the two sluggers had stayed in the dugout and didn t step up to the plate they wouldn t hit many home runs Sunday s Los Angeles Times headline made clear who had won the exchange Gore Asks Bradley to Step Up to Debate Plate You have to feel sorry for Bradley Having ignored him throughout the campaign Gore has decided at a moment oozing with political expediency to reverse course demand an open exchange and cast himself as the idealist Meanwhile the media are playing along hoping to egg on the fight In an interview with the Post after the Iowa showdown Bradley again ducked the debate question declining to lay all the cards out on the table just because Gore suddenly finds it convenient As a strategist Bradley knows he d be an idiot to debate Gore And the last thing Bradley can afford is to look like a strategist
