 Jeffrey Toobin Hypocrite In his new book rehashing the Lewinsky scandal Jeffrey Toobin is disgusted by the fixation on the personal that leads journalists and others to investigate the private lives of public people The press he says could define tawdry voyeurism as the study of character but the labeling couldn t obscure the true nature of this new kind of reporting It amounted Toobin argues to a high minded rationale for covering the sex lives of famous people that satisfied a hunger for sleaze in a competitive market for journalists and journalism The dust jacket for Toobin s book A Vast Conspiracy says it analyzes the facts with a measure of dignity that this story has not yet received So what does Toobin do to publicize his book Dump Clinton sex documents on the Internet Specifically on Tuesday the Web site for Toobin s book promises the complete and unexpurgated depositions of Paula Jones and Bill Clinton a secretly recorded interview with Juanita Broaddrick who claims Clinton sexually assaulted her and most dignified of all the complete text of the affidavit in which Paula Jones identifies purported distinguishing characteristics of the President I called Toobin and asked him why this wasn t hypocritical and he offered various semi contradictory answers First he said that only one of the documents is what you would call a sex document The rest are highly political The one sex document in Toobin s view is the distinguishing characteristic affidavit in which as was reported over a year ago Jones says Clinton s penis was crooked But Toobin s classification system is suspect The Paula Jones deposition for example has already been partially made public The parts that haven t but that Toobin will now post seem to consist largely of defense lawyers grilling Jones on the details of her private sex life That makes at least two sex documents and gee they just happen to be the ones highlighted on the Toobin Web site Toobin then told me he was justified in releasing the documents because they were part of history now He then switched course saying There s no point arguing people aren t interested in it I like gossip as much as the next guy The difference between me and the character police is that I don t try to dress gossip up as more than it is As say part of history But wait a minute Would it have been OK to report on Clinton s sex life in all its moist detail if the press had only admitted the purpose was pure gossip That can t be Toobin s position It s impossible to read his book with its righteous denunciations of tawdry voyeurism and think his main complaint with the coverage of Clinton s sex life is that it wasn t forthright enough about the pleasures of disclosing the private lives of public people I don t think Toobin can escape the charge of massive hypocrisy He s written a book denouncing people who sell books by revealing salacious private sexual details and he s selling his book by revealing salacious private sexual details or at least hinting he ll reveal them It s even less excusable in a way to reveal those details now that the Jones case and the Clinton impeachment have been settled If something was too private to reveal then why not let it rest for now Of course even Toobin s hypocrisy may not be enough to turn his book into a commercial success Are you itching to read another breathless account of what Paula Jones said to Danny Traylor I didn t think so
