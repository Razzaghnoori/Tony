 November 19 1993 Dear IDA Colleague Since its inception in 1979 the IDA Pursuit of Excellence Fund has enabled the IU School of Dentistry to support and reward faculty members for outstanding achievement This fund has given us the members of the Indiana Dental Association the opportunity to make a direct investment in the quality of dental education in our state We are pleased to tell you of a very exciting development with the fund which has reached a market value of 750 000 At the April meeting of the IDA Endowment Committee a goal was set to raise funds to increase the IDA Pursuit of Excellence fund to a minimum of 1 million Our intent is to establish a fully endowed chair at the dental school The members of the IDA would comprise the FIRST state dental association in the country to complete such a commitment to its state dental school An endowed chair will greatly benefit the IU School of Dentistry in recruiting and retaining outstanding faculty Income from the chair will provide funds for research and publishing graduate assistants library and laboratory acquisitions In the hands of an already successful scholar the extras that endowments provide ensure continued success for the scholar and the school Fulfillment of this goal requires full participation from members of the Indiana Dental Association The IU School of Dentistry and our entire profession will benefit greatly from this endowment Please join your fellow colleagues and make this dream come true for your association by making a significant pledge to this program Your full consideration of this investment in the IDA Pursuit of Excellence Fund is greatly appreciated Sincerely
