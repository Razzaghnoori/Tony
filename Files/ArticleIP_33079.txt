 Tomorrow Is an Udder Day She s Got a Bone To Pick One very important factor that Emily Yoffe leaves out in all the comparisons among diets in China Africa and America is genetic ethnic background Did these studies compare Chinese Americans to Chinese people in China and African Americans to native Africans The genetics of a person of European descent can be vastly different from a person of Chinese or African descent Osteoporosis breast cancer and sexual maturation are all highly influenced by genetics Unless you are comparing rural Chinese diets with the diets of Americans with the same ethnic background these comparisons are largely invalid People in Northern Europe and North America have consumed dairy products as a large part of their diets for centuries They also tend to have very different body types than Asians or Africans It is known that many people of African ethnic origin and other ethnic groups including Asian have problems digesting milk products past puberty People of Northern European descent often do not have this problem Could it also be that Northern European ethnicities have more problems with hip fractures or higher estrogen levels for reasons other than diet Just because rural Chinese and African people may not need high dairy consumption to be healthy does not mean that Americans should be discouraged from drinking milk Rachael Harralson Auburn Calif The Values Thing With respect to Jacob Weisberg s Ballot Box he makes one decent point and then blows it It s true that as he says We re electing someone to run the government not minister to the condition of our souls And though Bill Clinton proves that people will elect presidents who feel their pain still I think Weisberg is close to the mark on this point But from there he goes wrong George W Bush and Bill Bradley are not talking about individual holders of wealth Nor are they engaging in subtle class warfare They are responding to those who would assert that American society as a whole is just fine because it is collectively wealthy American society is manifestly not just fine I believe the majority of Americans if they think about it at all and keep in mind that the ones who think about it are also the ones who take the time to vote think that our cultural life has coarsened or even debased and that the sense of values that just 30 or even fewer years ago meant that the majority of Americans felt no need to lock their doors has been perhaps irretrievably lost How else can people understand tragedies such as Littleton in which normal middle class kids are not playing baseball or flirting with girls or even duking out their differences after school on the playground they are nursing monstrous visions of murder and mayhem while building bombs in their clueless parents garage Anyone who pays the least attention could make a long list of their preferred examples This is the spiritual emptiness Bush and Bradley are talking about Not whether a 27 year old Dellionaire is bored with his Lamborghini Or whether those less fortunate are envious of his horsepower Patrick Moore Dallas Revenge Killings Served Up Cold I must thank David Greenberg for the fascinating History Lesson on the postwar Jewish Revenge Group but I disagree that such an organized and frankly insane plan has much in common with the revenge killings by Albanians we assume of Serbs in present day Kosovo I think the Serbian government and police were the evil monsters in the recent conflict the Yugoslav army maybe less so and that the outcome of our bombing campaign was generally a good thing However I ve never had any illusions about the unsavory nature of the Kosovo Liberation Army as the more simple minded media outlets seem to still hold The killings of the 14 Serbian farmers look to be a case of classic terrorism with a clear political aim scaring the remaining Serbs out of Kosovo Killing even the boys and old men doesn t sound much like the vengeance of honorable men The Revenge Group on the other hand was bent on carrying out revenge killing without any political aim The Nazis were well out of power nothing would have come of the killings except a vague sense of self satisfaction on the part of those involved In any case I can t condone what either group of killers did or planned to do To even for an instant try to intellectually justify killing members of one group simply because other members of that group did unspeakable things whether that group consists of Serbian civilians or imprisoned SS guards is lazy thinking It s plainly wrong and there s no amount of philosophizing that could convince me it s not Paul Wagenseil New York How To Keep Your Kids From Turning Into Tele Tubbies The recent installment of Culturebox by Judith Shulevitz deserves comment She s wrong The issue isn t that working parents must choose between anesthetizing their children with television or catering to all their whims while also trying to pay the bills and nuke the frozen dinner Given a little guidance and some suitable playthings children who don t get hooked on television at an early age are actually perfectly capable of amusing themselves for long stretches of time Obviously there s a lot more to say on the subject but Shulevitz doesn t seem to be aware of much that has already been said Alix Beatty Chevy Chase Md
