 Sen John McCain The Man Who Should Be King It is this arm this right arm that North Vietnamese torturers worked over for days in a hellhole called the Plantation till it was broken and bruised and lacerated It is this arm this right arm that is still stiff still scarred still bent And it is this arm this right arm that the avaricious barons of tobacco who sell death and call it commerce think they can twist think they can break think they can make reach out to them open palmed But you see they don t understand that this arm has a man attached to it And they don t understand that the man is Sen John McCain who is allergic to their blandishments and threats just as he is allergic to the cozy sleazy compromises of this dark city just as he is allergic to the mendacious hypocrisies of politics as it is practiced in late 20 th century America For Sen John McCain is the last _____ man of honor hero honest man saint in American politics And perhaps if we are very lucky he is our next president Political journalism like all professions depends on the formula the ritual Newt is doomed or Clinton will survive anything stories During the past year there has been a significant addition to the Washington media formulary the John McCain profile It can be boiled down to this He was our bravest Vietnam prisoner of war Now he s the only senator courageous enough to tell the truth He is battling evil cigarette lobbyists and Senate money grubbers He may lose but he won t quit In 2000 he ll run for president We don t deserve someone this honorable Vote for him Esquire the New York Times Magazine Vanity Fair Time and countless newspapers have sanctified the Arizona Republican in this way Mike Wallace has said he would consider quitting 60 Minutes to aid a McCain 2000 campaign As far as the national media are concerned McCain can do no wrong When his tobacco bill was shot down the New York Times declared the defeat would only burnish his reputation When he got caught telling a dumb nasty about Chelsea Clinton the kind of crack that might cripple the career of someone else in Congress he apologized immediately was forgiven by the president and the love in continued Click for a brief sidebar on how McCain uses apology as a career strategy It s easy to understand why McCain has been anointed the media s favorite presidential hopeful He is irresistible In a Senate populated by grasping automatons he behaves like an actual human being Probably because of his five and a half year imprisonment he is impatient with the euphemisms and lies of politics Bob Dole once said of him You spend five years in a box and you re entitled to speak your mind McCain cracks jokes dishes dirt and generally mocks the hypocrisies and failings of his colleagues and himself The more his colleagues spin and position themselves the better he looks McCain also has the appeal of the maverick The press loves Republican traitors and McCain s willingness to buck his party bosses on campaign finance and tobacco makes great copy If he were a Democrat leading the fight against tobacco and campaign corruption no one would care There is something heroic about a politician who seems to act against his immediate self interest McCain benefits too from the general swoon about his history He is an awesome man He doesn t need to talk about the war Reporters most of whom never served in the military are paralyzed by him His indisputable bravery and honor inoculate him against charges of base motives And he makes himself phenomenally accessible According to Arizona reporters he s ill tempered and vindictive toward the local press but he charms the socks off national reporters He interrupts family vacations to appear on cable news and rises at ungodly hours on foreign trips to do TV interviews He has a knack for flattering reporters Other politicians obviously stage manage media encounters McCain by contrast is transparent He confides in reporters He holds conversations with his children in front of them He asks them for advice Tip to pols No 1 way to ensure a favorable article is to ask the reporter for advice But the McCain hagiography is not harmless It misleads the American people and it will disserve him if he does run for president He isn t just an honorable truth seeking hero a selfless iconoclast He s a schemer a politician a calculating populist who has built his career on sexy attention getting issues He is opportunistic He arrived at a convenient time in the tobacco fight He had no strong feelings about the evil weed and he became the tobacco scourge only when Republican leaders asked him to shepherd the bill through the Senate He adopted campaign finance reform only after he was tarred in the Keating Five scandal several years ago Others who ve devoted years to campaign finance and tobacco have watched McCain get credit as the heroic martyr the patron saint of lost causes What s more pernicious about the coverage is that it confuses the qualities of a crusader with those of a president McCain is often praised as an independent legislator but no one ever points out that he s a rather ineffective one He is unpopular in the Senate Some of his Republican colleagues dislike him for selfish reasons they envy his popularity and resent his outsider stances His colleagues feel he s a showboat and a camera hog says University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato But they also dislike him for good reasons McCain resists the political horse trading that underlies legislating He has said he has no plans to modify the tobacco bill to get it passed Well why not Similarly he infuriates senators with grandstanding attacks on pork being a master at publicizing and eliminating other senators sweetheart projects He does not recognize quid pro quo politics This naked righteous populism makes McCain a superb advocate on campaign finance and tobacco And there is certainly something romantic in the notion that America needs an honorable truth telling president like him But there is also something foolish in it McCain is a contrarian someone whose life is defined by lonely opposition He was a pilot not a platoon leader He resisted his captors alone and endured years in solitary confinement At the Naval Academy McCain was nicknamed Punk and that s what he is He suspects authority and challenges orthodoxy It s why he s a great story and a great troublemaker It s also why he would make a lousy president Being president is not about bucking authority it s about being authority It s not about resisting coercion it s about coercing and bargaining and sucking up and twisting arms and telling little lies John McCain thinks that s beneath him So he should stay in the Senate and continue to make trouble If you missed McCain s awful joke This describes McCain s penchant for apologies
