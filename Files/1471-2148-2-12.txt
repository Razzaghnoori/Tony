 Background The experimental system The design of the evolution experiment has been described elsewhere 19 In short 12 lines were derived from a single strictly asexual clone of E coli B that has been in the laboratory for several decades see http myxo css msu edu ecoli strainsource htmlfor more information The strain is prototrophic it can synthesize all components of a cell from a single energy source such as glucose and inorganic salts nitrogen etc and has undoubtedly undergone some general adaptation to the laboratory environment but has not been selected under any specific conditions like the evolution protocol prolonged serial transfer in minimal medium A spontaneous mutant of the ancestor capable of using arabinose Ara was used to found six of the replicates whereas the other six were founded with the Ara ancestor This trait can be used to distinguish between populations on indicator plates and is neutral in the selective environment 19 The populations are maintained by the daily transfer of 0 1 ml of culture into 9 9 ml of fresh Davis minimal media supplemented with 25 g ml of glucose DM25 These conditions allow roughly 5 10 7cells ml at stationary phase Every 500 generations 75 days samples of each population were stored in a glycerol suspension at 80 C The bacterial populations that are the focus of this study have been well studied 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 A brief review of the relevant observations follows First each of these lines has adapted to growth in a serially diluted or seasonal environment of glucose limited minimal media 19 20 21 22 The dynamics of adaptation are well known after a period of rapid adaptation during the first 1 000 generations the rate of improvement has subsequently slowed to almost one thirtieth of the initial rate 20 27 Moreover relatively few mutations generated this early rapid adaptation 19 20 24 Thus these populations have experienced two types of dynamics one of rapid adaptation followed by one of much slower improvement Nonetheless this gradual adaptation contributed significantly to the mean fitness relative to the ancestor of 1 7 by generation 20 000 27 Travisano and Lenski 22 23 demonstrated that adaptations specific to growth on glucose were partly responsible for the initial fitness improvements They found that evolved populations tended to outcompete the ancestor on substrates that share membrane transport pathways with glucose but were inferior on substrates that did not To assess the longer term consequences of these adaptations Cooper and Lenski 27 employed Biolog plates which are microtiter plates containing 95 different carbon sources and an indicator dye that reflects the amount of respiration on each substrate Sampling three clones per population after generations 2 000 10 000 and 20 000 the authors found that average performance on the 64 informative foreign substrates decayed significantly over time The primary objective of this study was to deduce which of two population genetic mechanisms antagonistic pleiotropy and mutation accumulation was more responsible for specialization results were strongly in favor of antagonistic pleiotropy However this experiment also approximated the evolution of one aspect of the fundamental niche diet breadth in these populations Cooper et al 28 continued this line of research by studying the evolution of thermal niche in these populations which are maintained at a constant 37 C Maximum growth rate which has been shown to be the primary determinant of fitness in this system 21 was measured across a range of temperatures 20 42 C over evolutionary time The authors found a surprising amount of correlated adaptation to moderate temperatures surrounding 37 C suggesting that selection at this temperature had favored mutations that also improved performance at presumably physiologically similar temperatures However mean performance at extreme temperatures 20 C 40 C decreased over evolutionary time with several evolved clones failing to grow at these temperatures Judging the effect of this laboratory evolution on the thermal niche of these bacterial populations therefore depends on one s perspective Mean growth at extreme temperatures tended to decrease but mean growth rates across a range of moderate temperatures actually increased over time In summary the functionality of these evolved E coli populations under certain conditions has been compromised by long term adaptation to a single resource single temperature environment Yet most of these experiments have approximated the fundamental niche by examining each clone in isolation from its ancestor and other members of the population By comparison measuring the realized niche requires a head to head test of fitness with the ancestor After a survey of diet breadth using Biolog plates this study focuses on a series of direct competitions between evolved isolates from 10 000 generations and the ancestor in four foreign environments Assays of individual functions and whole organism fitness are clearly quite different but it is the latter poorly measured property that ultimately determines both evolutionary success and the tangible dimensions of the niche Experimental design These experiments focus only on isolates from the populations at 10 000 generations and their common ancestors Three clones from each population were picked randomly from platings of these cultures and frozen separately each experiment therefore compares 36 clones 12 populations 3 clones with the two ancestors Ara and Ara I studied multiple clones from each population because there are within population polymorphisms that may be associated with functional differences 25 28 29 30 The environments are described as follows First I both increased and decreased the concentration of glucose 25 g ml of glucose is standard in the evolutionary medium in order to test the specificity of adaptation to the environment I hypothesized that adaptation to a particular concentration of glucose in the medium might reduce competitive ability at either lower 2 5 g ml or higher 250 g ml concentrations perhaps because of tradeoffs between resource affinity and maximum growth rate Next I added bile salts which are organic detergents that are lethal to most non enteric bacteria to the standard experimental medium Tolerance to bile salts is a characteristic that has been used to define enteric bacteria over the years which is shared by the ancestor in this experiment In E coli it has been established that bile acids may traverse the outer membrane through the OmpF porin which is the same porin through which glucose passes 31 If selection for improved glucose transport resulted in a greater number of OmpF porins relative to the more bile resistant smaller channel OmpC porin 31 32 for example it is possible that tolerance to bile salts was compromised as the populations evolved As a second test of the effect of selection on the outer membrane I measured the resistance to the antibiotic novobiocin of each population While novobiocin acts primarily as a DNA gyrase inhibitor resistance is mediated by the concentration of phospholipids in the outer membrane for which the cls gene encoding cardiolipin synthase is partly responsible 33 Again if selection had increased membrane permeability sensitivity to novobiocin might have increased relative to the partially resistant ancestor I chose the LB Luria broth environment because its nutrients are so different from the selection medium but other conditions remain the same e g culture vessel temperature and serial transfer regime LB media consists of tryptone yeast extract which is the water soluble portion of autolyzed yeast and salt In short it is a complex of nutrients largely devoid of simple carbohydrates like glucose The LB environment was diluted with distilled water to generate comparable cell density with the standard selective environment For each competition in a foreign environment fitness was also simultaneously measured in the standard medium for a direct reference Results Diet breadth narrows Consistent with a previous study 27 I found a significant decline in diet breadth of an average of 25 for all evolved populations Figure 1 one sampled t test t 9 49 df 11 p 0001 This decline in diet breadth proved to be general and not limited to a few substrates on average evolved populations tended to perform worse than the ancestor There was no significant variation among populations in the sum of all catabolic functions but there was significant variation among clones within populations Table 1 A single specialist clone in population A 5 that grew less than 50 as well as the ancestor on 47 of 68 substrates caused much of this effect but this clone was otherwise normal on glucose Another specialist clone that was abnormally deficient on fewer substrates was also found in population A 4 These clones were not better or worse competitors than other clones in the evolution environment because of their reduced functionality however data not shown If these two outlying clones are omitted from the nested ANOVA of diet breadth then significant variation exists among populations F 11 22 2 34 p 043 but no longer among clones within populations F 22 34 957 p 534 Fitness improved in foreign environments I evaluated diet breadth in a second contrasting manner by competing clones from evolved populations directly against the ancestor in four foreign environments In the first experiment I measured competitive fitness versus the ancestor over a 100 fold range of glucose concentrations in the otherwise standard experimental environment Clones were competed in two test environments DM2 5 and DM250 as well as in the control environment DM25 I found a significant effect of glucose concentration on population mean fitness Table 2 Populations and clones within populations also varied significantly in their performances at different glucose concentrations as evidenced by the significant interaction terms in the ANOVA in Table 3 Not surprisingly populations were most fit in the DM25 environment in which they evolved Figure 2 t tests for paired comparisons DM2 5 vs DM25 t s 5 48 df 11 p 001 DM25 vs DM250 t s 14 08 df 11 p 001 However all populations were more fit than the ancestor in both DM2 5 and DM250 that is adaptation to the DM25 environment brought about correlated improvements in fitness rather than tradeoffs at other glucose concentrations Figure 2 In addition populations were uniformly more fit in the DM2 5 environment than in the DM250 environment paired t test t s 6 37 df 11 p 001 In the second experiment I evaluated the effect of adding bile salts to the experimental medium Figure 3 The evolved populations performed nearly equivalently with or without bile salts relative to the ancestor 1 tailed paired t s 1 10 df 11 p 138 A nested ANOVA on the fitness data in DM25 bile salts did reveal marginally significant variation among and within populations Table 3 A single clone from population A 5 caused nearly all of this variation within populations this same clone was also deficient on numerous carbon sources on Biolog plates When I omitted this clone from the nested ANOVA there was more significant variation among populations for fitness in bile salts F 11 22 2 615 p 026 but not among clones within populations F 22 34 718 p 790 In the final experiment I altered the competitive environment in a more pronounced manner by using a much more complex medium LB instead of minimal salts supplemented with glucose I anticipated the greatest difference in fitness between this environment and the control Indeed mean fitness in LB was significantly lower than that in the control environment paired t test t s 12 278 df 11 p 001 However it was surprising that nine of 12 populations had nevertheless increased in fitness in LB relative to the ancestor and that the fitness of one population A 1 was statistically indistinguishable when grown in LB or DM25 Figure 4 On the other hand three populations were statistically equivalent to the ancestor in LB fitness i e the 95 confidence intervals of these means not shown did not exclude the ancestral fitness which equals 1 0 In addition a nested ANOVA using fitness in LB revealed highly significant variation among populations but not within populations Table 4 Most populations become sensitive to novobiocin Assays that examined the ability of each population to grow on agar plates containing novobiocin demonstrated that most populations became sensitive to this antibiotic not shown Nine of 12 populations were completely sensitive to the antibiotic no colonies were observed for any of the three clones tested per population Only one of the 12 populations Ara 3 retained a level of resistance comparable to that of the ancestor and two other populations Ara 3 and Ara 5 were intermediately sensitive Discussion Spiegelman and collaborators 34 35 asked bacteriophage Q only to go forth and replicate in the medium containing Q replicase and numerous functions were lost We have issued a similar injunction to these E coli populations except in a glucose and minimal salts medium Following this precedent these long term evolving E coli populations should have become streamlined glucose scavengers and evolved a substantially reduced niche This was not the case at least not nearly to the extent observed in Q Only one absolute catabolic loss D ribose 36 was observed in all twelve lineages and one additional function resistance to novobiocin was lost in most populations These populations performed no worse on average than the ancestor in most functions assayed and the significant losses that were found tended to be small in absolute magnitude not shown see also 27 Nonetheless the fundamental niche approximated by Biolog plates declined by an average of 25 and no systematic gains in function occurred that might have compensated for other losses of function In these populations specialization did not involve numerous wholesale losses of function but rather reduced performance on many substrates not used during the evolution experiment The degree of decay varied both among and within populations for growth on different substrates Table 1 and a substantial amount of functional decay occurred in two of the 36 clones sampled Thus the fundamental catabolic niche of these populations became narrower while adapting to this simple laboratory environment However I arrived at a strikingly different conclusion when I measured the relative fitness which is analogous to the realized niche of the evolved populations in four different foreign environments In these assays performance was quantified by directly competing the evolved genotypes with the ancestors and in nearly every case the evolved genotype was the superior competitor These correlated improvements in fitness in novel environments suggest that adaptation to the laboratory environment was nonspecific and multifaceted and seem to downplay the significance of the compromised fundamental niche Each of these novel environments was not entirely foreign to the evolved populations however Though glucose concentration was both raised and lowered tenfold conditions remained otherwise identical to those of the evolution experiment These populations were clearly superior at the lower concentration which in hindsight likely results from their familiarity with this glucose level Because glucose concentration in the experimental medium drops below 25 g ml as the population grows competitive ability at lower concentrations was likely favored even if only briefly 21 Yet the mechanism behind the greater fitness gains in 2 5 g ml than in 250 g ml glucose need not be the glucose concentration itself Vasi et al 21 argued that selection in these lines for improved resource affinity at low concentrations was weak which perhaps implicates some other factor in the medium oxygen concentration different concentrations of metabolic by products toxicity of increased nutrients etc as the cause of the lesser fitness gains in 250 g ml glucose Bile salts are an important component of the natural environment of E coli so much so that resistance to these compounds is often used to define enteric bacteria in microbiological assays Bile salts are like novobiocin in that both are antibiotics that interact with the outer membrane but their mechanisms of interaction and their effects on these populations are rather different Most populations completely lost the ability to grow in the presence of novobiocin which suggests an increase in membrane permeability 33 However no significant differences in fitness were found when bile salts were added to the selective medium indicating that the mechanisms of increased outer membrane permeability were not detrimental to bile resistance This may reflect an ability of E coli to actively export bile salts that was unaffected by this experiment 31 Thus if changes in membrane permeability perhaps through modified expression of genes like cls 33 were responsible for the loss of novobiocin resistance they apparently had specific effects that did not compromise other membrane traits like tolerance to bile salts Experiments are underway to establish the mechanism that links adaptation increased membrane permeability and increased novobiocin sensitivity I found no systematic cost of adaptation to the simple laboratory environment when I modified the glucose concentration or added bile salts but rather found correlated improvements in fitness that were sometimes nearly equivalent to the direct adaptation The simple explanation is that each of these environments differed by only one factor from the minimal medium in which the populations have evolved However the complex LB environment is certainly different enough from minimal glucose medium that any improvements in fitness in the LB environment are surprising One interpretation of all of the correlated adaptations in novel environments is that natural selection favored beneficial mutations that are unaffected by the nutrient medium itself Whereas I altered the carbon source and media composition I did not change other conditions like the speed of shaking aeration temperature or the batch culture protocol Perhaps more significantly the populations remained sheltered from the potential onslaught of competing bacteria and predatory viruses which could conceivably drastically alter their performance It is likely that the 12 populations have adapted in part to several of components of the feast and famine minimal laboratory environment and changing only one of them may not affect the superiority of other genetic adaptations Thus detecting adaptive decay may require more dramatic modifications to the environment Evidently these evolving populations by acquiring mutations that were beneficial under several environmental conditions expanded the niche they could potentially realize More specifically mutations that improved fitness in 25 g ml glucose may have also improved fitness in 250 g ml glucose because of the common resource as well as in dilute LB because of the equivalent cell density allowed by the medium The same genotypes examined here were also tested in undiluted LB which is a medium that is roughly 100 fold more concentrated More losses of fitness were found which suggests some specialization based on resource concentration but replicates of the same genotype were too inconsistent to be considered reliable V S Cooper unpublished data In general these competitions in novel environments suggest that mutations that were beneficial in the selective environment may sometimes have positive pleiotropic effects These contrasting conclusions about how the niche of these bacterial populations has evolved may actually be reconciled if we consider the potential mechanisms of adaptation in fact they might inform our hunt for them as well The contrary findings of novobiocin sensitivity and bile salt resistance have already been presented but these results along with other catabolic phenotypes potentially limit the gene candidates upon which selection may have acted to improve life in a simple glucose limited environment The fact that evolved clones appear to respire several resources poorly yet are at least as fit as the ancestor in the diverse LB environment suggest that enhancements in the general growth potential of these populations may compensate for these deficiencies This argues indirectly that the mutations responsible for reduced fundamental diet breadth are either completely silent in environments similar to the evolution model or are in fact beneficial 36 Conclusions The expansion of the potential niche of these populations into different media formulations is indeed remarkable but should not be construed as an evolutionary trend towards generalism Travisano and Lenski 22 23 demonstrated that 2 000 generations of evolution was sufficient for these populations to lose fitness when grown on alternative sugars and the reductions in maximum growth rate at extreme temperatures suggest a trend towards specialization in thermal niche 28 Together these investigations of the correlated responses to adaptation to a specific environment demonstrate the mismatch between the arbitrary scales that we use to measure performance and real biological alternatives Genetic variation need not project phenotypes along a Celsius scale or among an assortment of carbon sources As a result generalizations about the nature of the evolution of specialization and the clarification of the folk wisdom may elude us until the mechanisms and tendencies of evolutionary change are better revealed Thus despite the inclination to add complexity to these microbial environments so as to better simulate the real world it remains evident that we as evolutionary geneticists still have our hands full Methods Measurement of diet breadth Following closely the protocol described in Cooper and Lenski 27 I used Biolog ES designed for E coli and Salmonella spp microtiter plates to obtain estimates of catabolic diet breadth These plates have 95 different carbon sources and a tetrazolium indicator dye whose intensity is proportional to the amount of respiration on that substrate I measured optical density immediately after inoculation and then after 24 hours of incubation the difference in these figures less the reading from the blank well estimated functionality on each resource Diet breadth is expressed as the average performance relative to the ancestor on all foreign resources Mathematical transformations required to generate this average are described in detail in Cooper and Lenski 27 Experiments were conducted in two complete blocks of 36 evolved 10 000 generation clones 12 populations 3 clones and 6 ancestral genotypes 2 ancestors 3 replicates Competition in foreign environments All experiments were conducted in 50 ml Erlenmeyer flasks in a 37 C shaking incubator conditions identical to the long term evolutionary environment see 19 for specific culture conditions Cultures were founded from 80 freezer isolates and grown in Davis minimal DM medium supplemented with 1000 g ml of glucose Cultures were then acclimated to the test environment via a 1 4 000 dilution into fresh medium and incubated for 24 h Each evolved genotype and the ancestor of the opposite Ara marker were each diluted 1 200 into a common flask containing 9 9 ml of the test media and then incubated 1 day Certain clones generated unusually low yields in the LB environment so competitions were founded with a 2 1 starting ratio of evolved to ancestral genotypes rather than the typical 1 1 All other details of competitions involving these clones were unchanged Initial and final densities of each competition culture were determined by plating aliquots onto TA indicator plates which allow Ara and Ara competitors to be distinguished by their colony color Relative fitness was quantified by calculating the ratio of the number of doublings for the derived and ancestral competitors see 19 for details Competition experiments versus the ancestor were conducted in two complete blocks of 36 evolved 10 000 generation clones 12 populations 3 clones in each foreign environment and the paired control DM25 environment The concentration for the bile salt treatment was selected to mimic the concentration of bile salts in MacConkey Agar 1 5 g L of Sigma Bile Salts consisting of 50 sodium cholate 50 sodium deoxycholate which is typically used to identify enteric bacteria For each competition experiment I conducted one or more of the following statistical tests using SPSS version 8 0 SPSS Inc Chicago IL 1 a nested ANOVA on the fitness data in the novel environment designed to identify significant population and clone level variance population and clone are random factors 2 a mixed model nested ANOVA designed to identify the effect of environment fixed factor on population and clone level variance both random factors and 3 a paired t test to differentiate fitness in each experimental environment relative to control In addition I inspected the data for potential outlier clones within populations that caused significant effects at the level of clone I identified one clone from one population A 6 clone A that was an outlier in nearly all environments novel and control Given that it was also inferior in the control environment this clone was omitted and analyses 1 3 were recalculated Assay for novobiocin sensitivity Novobiocin resistance is an ancestral character that is sometimes dependent upon mutations in the cell envelope including the structural component lipopolysaccarides as well as outer membrane porins 32 Assays were conducted by distributing approximately 250 cells on LB plates containing 400 g ml novobiocin Replicates of the ancestors produced an average of 40 colonies after 48 hours If 2 colonies emerged after 72 hours the evolved clone was deemed to be sensitive Three clones for each of the twelve populations were assayed in this manner and replicated twice each
