        recently graduated from high school meaning like uh you know       three or four years ago im a senior in in uh college now and uh   uhhuh   i cant really talk too much about the problems with uh public education in detail because the school system i went to was uh really superb even though it was a public school system   really yeah i i feel that my uh im a junior in college now and i go to Tech Georgia Tech   oh okay yeah   and uh   i got a friend who goes there by the way i wanted to ask talk to you about that afterward okay     okay  uh ive the high school i went to was uh was a good one also and i well i guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools because the one i went to was you know im sure a a lot nicer than you know a lot of the inner city schools and the things around Atlanta   yeah yeah it was a a its a more or less a suburban school system yes thats that was true for mine too um   yeah   although i  im sure to some extent that money is part of the problem in the disparity but i dont think i honestly dont think thats the biggest part of it   what   you know i think that uh i mean i know that in my town you know most of the most of the parents theyre valued education and uh   yeah thats true   you know and so the students were you know to some extent motivated to learn i mean you know   yeah and im also i mean in the in those places where uh like the economy is really bad they might you know be more tempted to to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the you know money to put food on the table and stuff like that more than they would you know in areas where they   yeah thats true but  but uh i think i mean even more than that even i mean if you drop out in high school   yeah uhhuh   you should still be able to read you know which it sounds i mean it sounds like uh now i think maybe it just started changing in the past few years because uh   yeah thats true   they have more of these um sort of mandatory mandatory tests you have to take before you get a diploma but uh   right   but uh certainly before that there are people that you know like would graduate from high school and could barely read um and thats just sort of inexcusable and you cant really i i i mean i just cant even picture how that could happen   yeah   you know except maybe to someone whose you know really badly learning uh disabled or something but these people obviously werent   thats hard for me to say since i didnt       i didnt really grow well when i went to elementary school it it it wasnt in a great area but i still i mean i learned to read started learning to read when i was in kindergarten you know so i guess i cant really   yeah yeah   i cant say what it would be like to uh grow up in a really oppressed uh region you know i guess the whole the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the for those people   yeah yeah i mean i think thats almost a bigger factor than anything else probably i mean i dont i think       you know if people just   so i guess the problem is the the thing to do is to try to i dont get some kind of motivation to learn and   yeah and again i dont i mean again i dont know that im you know how qualified i mean i think itd be interesting   uhhuh   to you know to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school uh you know sort of sort of maybe from elementary through uh high school you know just sort of to get a feel for what its like   yeah uhhuh   i think that would be an interesting experience but uh i havent done that   no i i cant say that i have either       but uh   but i do i do think that um i mean public education in general i think can work and i think its a good thing   yeah ive ive ive heard some i mean ive heard statistics statistics statistics and things that that compare a public education to a private education i mean within like within the same uh income groups   yeah   if you compare the like the people that could have that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that you know the people that uh did send their kids to private schools i think they compare fairly you know fairly well   yeah yeah yeah i mean i dont i honestly dont really think i could have you know done much better than i did in the school system i was in you know i mean its   yeah i  i know in my schools also i mean they they have a lot of uh once once it seemed i got into high school they had a lot of uh accelerated accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that and that mean that that makes a big difference because uh when youre when youre taking classes with uh   yeah   with people that are really are interested in the in the subject and stuff like that   yeah i mean and in the once you book junior high uh start junior high starting in eighth grade all the way through high school there were four levels you well no i guess it was in junior high it was still three then in high school it changed into four levels of uh of instruction in the major subjects   uhhuh   uh which i mean actually i think that works pretty well i mean that that makes
