 Headline Now Andrew you know perfectly well that I support the right of gays to marry for exactly the reasons of civil liberties and civil rights you cite You even anthologized my essay on the subject So please don t get on your high horse about gay marriage with me And who exactly is this left that shuns fidelity and bourgeois bliss Outside some small gay subcultures like Sex Panic I think there are few who take this position on principle i e yes you must have sex outside your relationship and no you can t have a nice quiet domestic life with children and a house I don t know that I d call Linda and Paul world class celebrities and millionaires many times over bourgeois exactly by the way In practice of course people of all political persuasions are unfaithful and choose other things fame power excitement variety attention distance over making a sane responsible life with a loved partner And many especially in the gay world and maybe the White House too have bourgeois bliss with a life partner and sexual excitement somewhere else I don t think politics has much to do with these intimate only half conscious decisions it comes from someplace deeper Face it Andrew as ideology family values rule left right and center In practice they compete with all the other exigencies and opportunities of reality and human nature Just for the record my own relationship is so square it s cubic It s just not a legal marriage I think you are making a mistake to equate distaste for wedlock with libertinism There are many more than two sides to these issues Cheers Katha
