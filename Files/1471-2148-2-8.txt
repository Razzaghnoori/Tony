 Background Pyridine 2 6 bis thiocarboxylic acid pdtc is an iron regulated metabolite produced by certain pseudomonads that is highly reactive towards metals by virtue of a pair of thiocarboxylate groups and ring nitrogen that combine to form a non specific high affinity tri dentate ligand Figure 1 1 2 The formation constants for Co Cu and Fe complexes of pdtc were determined to be greater than 10 33 3 Uptake studies using 59Fe showed that addition of pdtc to the growth medium of two different pdtc producing pseudomonads increased the efficiency of iron uptake by 20 1 The contribution of pdtc to iron uptake may be due to the fact that the copper complex of pdtc Cu pdtc has the ability to reduce both soluble and mineral forms of ferric iron 1 Not surprisingly in light of its high affinity for essential metals pdtc also exhibits antimicrobial activity 4 MoeB the molybdopterin synthase activating enzyme MSAE is part of the well characterized molybdopterin cofactor MPT Mo synthesis pathway A dimer of MoeB adenylates the MoaD subunits of molybdopterin synthase that after the conversion of these AMP moieties to thiocarboxylates by a sulfurtransferase goes on to convert precursor Z to molybdopterin MPT 5 6 Molybdopterin synthase is a heterotetrameric protein composed of two units each of MoaD and MoaE The crystal structure of the E coli MoeB MoaD complex clearly shows the interaction between these two proteins and unambiguously confirms the adenylation role of MoeB 7 After a thiocarboxylate moiety is formed on the terminal glycine of each MoaD subunit the two sulfur atoms are transferred to precursor Z as sulfhydryl groups in a dithiolene configuration 8 9 10 11 Molybdenum is added to MPT in subsequent steps to generate MPT Mo the active form of the molybdopterin cofactor Since MPT Mo is required for nitrate reductase activity 12 the activity of this enzyme can be used as a diagnostic indicator for the presence of the MPT Mo synthetic pathway 7 There are a number of genomic sequences deposited in GenBank as MoeB proteins although only a few have been physiologically or genetically proven to function in MPT Mo synthesis Two moeB sequences with evidence for function include a knockout of the open reading frame encoding GenBank accession number BAA35521 which was shown to cause the accumulation of precursor Z in E coli 13 and accession number Z95150 which was found to be located within a cluster of other MPT Mo synthesis genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 14 MSAEs from eukaryotic organisms have also been characterized MOCS3 GenBank accession number NM_014484 from humans and cnx 5 from Arabidopsis thaliana 15 respectively have been sequenced and cnxF from Aspergillus nidulans 16 has been both sequenced and physiologically characterized MoeZ is one of several MSAE like conceptually translated protein sequences identified by the M tuberculosis genome sequencing group at Sanger Center 14 Although coding for a putative protein with high sequence similarity to MoeB moe Z was so named because it had no genetic linkage to other MPT Mo synthesis genes Cole et al 14 state in their GenBank entry accession number Z95120 that MoeZ is possibly involved in the synthesis of molybdopterin but there has been no biochemical or physiological characterization of this protein An open reading frame ORF F identified as a necessary part of the Pseudomonas stutzeri pdt locus coding for the synthesis pathway of pdtc Figure 1 was found to have 57 identity to M tuberculosis MoeZ at the amino acid AA level Further analysis revealed that a 521 base pair region of P stutzeri ORF F shares 80 homology with M tuberculosis moe Z 17 The products of the pdt locus probably function by activating then sulfurating a carboxylic acid precursor The end product of this synthesis is pdtc a molecule with two thiocarboxylic acid groups that is secreted from the cell Recently data obtained from genome sequencing projects have made it clear that bacteria exchange genetic information by means of transducing bacteriophages conjugative plasmids and natural transformation 18 at a much higher rate than previously thought 19 There seem to be few insurmountable barriers to interspecies gene transfer with transfers being documented between such diverse organisms as archea and eubacteria 20 Synechococcus sp 21 and some P stutzeri strains 22 are two examples of the many bacterial species known to undergo natural transformation Of the completely sequenced genomes all show some level of lateral gene transfer LGT For example 3 3 and 16 6 of the M tuberculosis and Synechocystis sp PCC6803 genomes respectively are estimated to be composed of sequences acquired by LGT 19 We report here on the structural functional and evolutionary relationships of moeZ and discuss the possibility that the discontinuous distribution of moeZ is the result of a LGT event between unrelated bacteria Results and Discussion Structure We assembled a set of sequences similar to the product of Pseudomonas stutzeri pdt locus ORF F Ps moeZ Table 1 Protein BLAST searches using Ps MoeZ as the query yielded more than 100 sequences with significant similarity BLAST E value 0 01 Interestingly Ps MoeZ had higher similarity to seven sequences of mycobacterial streptomycete and cyanobacterial origin than to the most similar pseudomonad sequence Table 2 NA BLAST searches showed that Ps moeZ had higher homology as measured by length of homologous overlap to four of these same sequences than to pseudomonad sequences Table 2 Figure 2a We found that Mlo moeZdR Mle moeZ Mt moeZ Pa moeB Pa moeBR Sc moeBR and Syc moeZ had significant homology 35 bp of 75 identity to Ps moeZ Table 2 To characterize the structure function and evolution of Ps MoeZ we chose to study these seven genes along with the P stutzeri sequence Ec moeB was included in the study because its function has been extensively characterized Mt moeBR Nos moeZ and Syy moeZ were included for reasons discussed later BLAST searches of finished and unfinished microbial genomes http www ncbi nlm nih gov Microb_blast yielded additional sequences in the genomes of Corynebacterium diphtheriae Mycobacterium avium M bovis and M smegmatis with significant NA homology to Ps moeZ but these were not included in this study because of their potentially provisional nature pending completion of the genome sequencing projects Inclusion of these sequences in the analyses presented here did not change any of our conclusions Using each protein sequence listed in Table 1as a query to search the Conserved Domain Databases we found that each contained an N terminal domain with high similarity BLAST E value 6 30 to the ThiF family domain Pfam00899 Table 2 Figure 2c suggesting that this portion of all the proteins in this study performed a similar function The ThiF protein adenylates ThiS prior to sulfuration of that protein by a separate sulfurtransferase 23 24 Pfam00899 encompasses the nucleotide binding site of ThiF All 12 sequences in this region have high similarity to the derived consensus sequence GXGXXG 7X A SX GXGXXG 4X D 9X R which defines a nucleotide binding motif 16 25 In addition all sequences have five residues or conservative substitutions in the case of Pa MoeB shown to participate in the adenylation reaction catalyzed by Ec MoeB Figure 3 7 The fact that such high similarities are retained in the ThiF coding region across three bacterial divisions suggests that this domain functions more or less autonomously If the ThiF domain interacts only with dinucleotides and had evolved to a high degree prior to the speciation of the strains in our study then there would be little selective pressure to fix additional modifications The high degree of AA similarity that all 12 sequences have to the ThiF family domain probably indicates that these proteins at least in part perform a similar function most likely activating a substrate by adenylation All of the predicted amino acid sequences except Ec MoeB Mlo MoeZdR and Pa MoeB also have C terminal similarity BLAST E value 1 12 to a rhodanese like domain Pfam00581 Figure 2c Table 2 26 Rhodanese a thiosulfate cyanide sulfurtransferase EC 2 8 1 1 is composed of two domains that are similar in three dimensional structure but divergent in sequence 27 All residues contributing to the active site of rhodanese are contained within its C terminal domain The cysteine that covalently bonds to the transferred S atom is conserved in all nine of the sequences that contain the rhodanese like domain included in this study data not shown The similarity scores to the rhodanese like domain for those sequences that contain it were lower than the ThiF similarity scores However since the rhodanese domain is characterized by conservation in terms of three dimensional structure rather than primary sequence these lower similarity scores are not surprising Examination of the Clustal X alignment of all the protein sequences revealed significant structural differences Figure 3 In addition to the ThiF family domain all sequences except Mlo MoeZdR also possessed a region similar to the C terminal half of ThiF Ec MoeB Mt MoeBR Pa MoeB Pa MoeBR and Sc MoeBR all contain two pairs of cysteine residues each arranged in a CXXC motif and spaced 68 70 residues apart like those in ThiF proteins arrows in Figures 2cand 3 But the Ps MoeZ sequence along with Mlo MoeZdR Mle MoeZ Mt MoeZ Nos MoeZ Syc MoeZ and Syy MoeZ lacks these four cysteine residues In all these sequences except Mlo MoeZdR the first CXXC motif is replaced with NYRD In Mlo MoeZdR the first CXXC is substituted with GYRD All these sequences except Mlo MoeZdR also have a gap in place of the second CXXC Mlo MoeZdR ends prior to the position where the second CXXC would occur This dual CXXC motif found in MoeB ThiF and HesA proteins forms a metal center with a zinc atom 7 9 The presence of all four of these cysteines has been shown to be required for activity in MoeB 5 Therefore the proteins lacking them are unlikely to function as MSAEs We designated the region containing these two cysteine pairs as 2X CXXC for the purposes of our discussion Figure 2C MoeBR MoeZdR and MoeZ proteins can be further differentiated from MoeBs by the inclusion of a polyproline motif immediately following the first CXXC location boxed area in Figure 3 This polyproline tract is immediately adjacent to a disordered surface loop found in MoeB proteins thought to be involved in protein protein interactions 7 The consensus for this motif RXLYPEPPPP closely corresponds to a sequence RSLYPPPPPP found in rat and human metabotropic 1 glutamate receptors 28 29 This motif is reminiscent of protein protein interaction domains found in some proteins 30 however interactions of this type have not been shown to be facilitated by the polyproline motif in rat and human metabotropic 1 glutamate receptors An AA substitution found in MoeBRs and MoeZs may alter the substrate specificity of these enzymes In Ec MoeB sheet 5 residues 149 155 of Ec MoeB Figure 3 forms part of the pocket which accepts the C terminal portion of MoaD of which the terminal glycine is subsequently adenylated 7 Ec MoeB I155 located at the C terminal end of this beta loop is substituted in MoeBR proteins by Y and in MoeZ proteins by F or Y These bulky substitutions may restrict access of the C terminus of MoeD like proteins and may indicate that a different type of substrate is adenylated by MoeBR and MoeZ The presence or absence of two features the two pairs of cysteines in the 2X CXXC domain and the rhodanese like domain form the primary basis for differentiation between the four different protein structures among the sequences found in Table 1 Figure 2c MoeB as represented by the functionally characterized Ec MoeB consists of an N terminal ThiF domain followed by a 2X CXXC domain with both CXXC pairs intact and no rhodanese like domain MoeBs also lack the polyproline motif and have I at position 155 MoeBR has the ThiF and 2X CXXC domains configured like MoeB but includes an N terminal rhodanese like domain the polyproline motif and has a Y substitution at position 155 Ec MoeB numbering MoeZ has all the components of MoeBR but all the cysteines in the CXXC motifs are absent and position 155 contains either F or Y Finally MoeZdR MoeZ deleted Rhodanese contains the ThiF domain followed by an N terminal portion of the 2X CXXC domain that has GYRD substituted for the first CXXC and terminates prior to the second CXXC pair MoeZdR probably does not function as a MoeB BR or Z protein because of its substantial truncation It is included in this study only because of its homology to Ps MoeZ Once these structural definitions were defined we decided to add Nos MoeZ and Syy MoeZ to our data set since they were MoeZs that we had not included in our dataset by reason of homology We also included Mt MoeBR because we were interested in the relationships between MoeBR and MoeZ sequences that were coresident in the same genome The Conserved Domain Database was screened for additional sequences related to the Ps MoeZ sequence This search yielded 19 proteins structurally similar to MoeBR and MoeZ proteins Five of these were eukaryotic sequences of unknown function five others were eukaryotic MSAE proteins and one was a ThiF ORF within an operon containing two other thiamin biosynthesis genes in Erwinia amylovora 31 The remaining eight sequences were of bacterial origin and were already included in our dataset A similar search using Pa MoeB as the query yielded 146 sequences with a domain structure similar to MoeB most of which were entered into the database as MoeB ThiF HesA or ubiquitin activating enzymes from archaea bacteria and eukaryota In terms of distribution the MoeB structure 146 sequences was much more common than the MoeBR structure 12 sequences while MoeZ was represented by only six sequences in the GenBank non redundant nr database Based on our sequence analysis some moeZ sequences have been misidentified Syc MoeZ Syy MoeZ and Nos MoeZ are identified as a MoeBs in GenBank accession numbers CAA76284 BAA18438 and NP_486946 respectively The lack of all essential cysteines in both copies of the CXXC motifs suggest that these MoeZs probably do not function like MSAE proteins Conserved NA sequences When the regions of greater than 75 NA homology between each individual NA sequence and Ps moeZ were plotted it became apparent that these homologies clustered in defined regions Figure 2a Five sequences had a homologous region within the N terminal half of the ThiF domain six sequences had a homologous area in the C terminal half of the same domain and four sequences showed homology to areas of the 2X CXXC domain Five sequences with greater than 200 bp of more than 75 NA acid identity to Ps moeZ Mle moeZ Mt moeZ Pa moeBR Sc moeBR and Syc moeZ along with Ps moeZ were designated the high homology group and used in subsequent analyses of the homologous regions Using a codon based alignment of the NA sequences in the high homology group we analyzed the occurrence of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions over the entire coding region The plot of the ratio of synonymous nonsynonymous substitutions dS dN identified five regions where the synonymous substitution rate exceeds the nonsynonymous substitution rate dS dN 1 suggesting that homology in these areas was driven by the need for AA conservation Figure 2b Analysis of a plot of the degree of identical amino acid residues among the high homology group showed that a high degree of AA similarity existed in these same regions data not shown Visual inspection of the NA alignment of the high homology group revealed that substitutions in the areas where dS exceeded dN tended to involve the second and third bases of the codons confirming the previous suggestion data not shown There was also a correlation between the regions of homology to Ps moeZ and the areas where synonymous substitutions exceeded nonsynonymous substitutions Figure 2aand 2b These correlations support the supposition that the NA homologies among the sequences are driven by functional constraints of the proteins and not by the need to maintain secondary nucleic acid structure Analysis of predicted secondary mRNA structure did not reveal any conserved stems or loops in the regions of NA conservation among the high homology group data not shown Function The functionality of MoeB MoeBR and MoeZ are known MoeB exemplified by Ec MoeB and MoeBR exemplified by cnxF of Aspergillis nidulans 16 participate in the synthesis of MPT Mo as MSAEs This is a housekeeping function for most organisms MoeZ on the other hand has been shown to be necessary for the synthesis of pdtc an unusual metabolite However since CTN1 a mutant of P stutzeri missing a 171 kb genomic fragment that includes moeZ 17 reduces nitrate as does the wild type data not shown it is evident that Ps moeZ is not necessary for MPT Mo synthesis Both moe BR and moe Z coexist in the M tuberculosis genome which exhibits nitrate reductase activity but moe BR is missing from M leprae which has no nitrate reductase activity The fact that these two separate genes are maintained in M tuberculosis supports the supposition that they perform different functions On the other hand the sequencing of the nitrate reducing cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp PCC6803 and Nostoc sp PCC7120 is complete but no MSAE sequences have been found Perhaps MoeZ fulfills MSAE function as part of a modified MPT Mo pathway in these species MoeBR incorporates a rhodanese like domain but MoeB does not Examples of both MoeB E coli and MoeBR CNXF of A nidulans have been characterized as MSAEs indicating that the C terminal rhodanese like domain addition does not inhibit MSAE activity The presence of a rhodanese domain in MoeBR and MoeZ suggests that these members of the family may perform an additional function compared to MoeB P aeruginosa has both a moe B and a moe BR also suggesting that the products of these two genes have different functions or perform the same function in a slightly different manner However there is no physiological evidence for the functional significance of the rhodanese domain in MoeBR Rhodanese extracts a sulfur from sulphane sulphur containing anions e g thiosulfate forms a temporary covalent linkage between the S atom and a conserved cysteine residue then transfers the sulfur to a thiophilic acceptor e g cyanide Whether sulfur transferase functionality is retained in the rhodanese like domains of MoeBR and MoeZ and whether these proteins can function to activate a substrate as well as transfer a sulfur containing moiety is unknown Evolution Because of the definitive structural features shared among MoeZs and the homologies among their coding regions we decided to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of moeZ sequences To infer baseline interspecies evolutionary relationships we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rDNA SSU sequences from the seven MoeZ containing strains included in our study We obtained sequences for all SSU alleles for each strain from GenBank Analysis of all the SSU alleles for strains with multiple copies revealed that there was no substantial variation among them We chose one representative full length SSU sequence for each strain for our analyses Table 1 The tree of SSU sequences shows the two proteobacteria P stutzeri and M loti at one end of the tree with cyanobacteria Synechococcus sp and Synechocystis sp and mycobacteria M leprae and M tuberculosis clades branching off from a common node Figure 4 This tree topology agrees with those that have been previously published 32 The moeB BR Z sequences under study are a mixture of orthologs and paralogs and a combined study of their phylogeny is not possible so we limited our study to moeZ sequences We constructed the tree from a gapless region of the NA alignment spanning the entire ThiF domain except for the last two bases The topology of the ThiF domain tree matches the SSU tree except that Ps moeZ which was adjacent to M loti in the SSU tree appeared between the cyanobacteria and mycobacteria clades Figure 4 Parsimony likelihood and distance methods all resulted in trees with the same topology Moreover the placement of Ps moeZ in the ThiF tree was not changed when full length MoeZ AA sequences were analyzed using the same methods Additional support for the topology of the ThiF domain tree was sought by conducting a manual analysis of the insertions and deletions indels in the alignment of full length moeZ sequences Ps moeZ contains five indels in the codon based NA alignment Table 3 Of these one is unique to Ps moeZ four are shared with members of the mycobacteria clade and none are shared with members of the cyanobacteria clade or Mlo moeZdR Thus the results of the indel analysis supported the position of Ps moeZ in the ThiF domain tree The incongruence between the SSU and the ThiF domain trees suggests that Ps moeZ may have been acquired by P stutzeri strain KC by lateral gene transfer LGT from an ancestor more closely related to mycobacteria and cyanobacteria than to proteobacteria The results of the indel analysis also suggest that Ps moeZ is more closely related to the mycobacteria moeZ sequences than to the cyanobacteria and proteobacteria moeZ sequences BLAST homology results also support this close relationship to the mycobacteria Although they were not included in the analysis presented here the homologies of Ps moeZ to sequences in the unfinished microbial genomes of M avium M bovis and M smegmatis were also very high and thus provide additional support for the placement of Ps moeZ in the ThiF tree and suggest that the direction of LGT was from a mycobacterial species to P stutzeri Comparison of the GC AT percentages and codon bias profiles of Ps moeZ to data from other known P stutzeri strain KC coding regions indicates that acquisition of Ps moeZ was ancient The GC AT percentages for the 1 st 2 nd 3 rd and all three codon bases combined compiled from the seven published coding regions of P stutzeri strain KC were 66 0 46 8 72 2 and 61 7 respectively For Ps moeZ these values were similar 64 8 42 6 75 3 and 60 9 respectively A comparison of the Ps moeZ codon bias table with the one compiled from the seven published strain KC coding regions did not reveal any divergent trends Many of these substitutions could be due to GC AT percentage adjustment to the P stutzeri genome but since the donor is unknown and only seven ORFs have been sequenced from strain KC a definitive analysis is not possible It is not unreasonable that a pseudomonad coexisting in the soil with cyanobacteria mesorhizobium streptomycete and free living mycobacteria could acquire moeZ from one of these species P stutzeri has been characterized as having an exceptionally plastic genome with high genotypic diversity within the species 33 LGT events are thought to contribute to this plasticity and consistent with this many P stutzeri strains also exhibit a natural transformation ability 34 The fact that incorporation of DNA into the genome through homologous recombination requires a region of homology usually limits LGT mediated by natural transformation to closely related species 34 35 The ThiF domains of the high homology group do provide a region of homology suitable for homologous recombination This homology is shared across a wide range of species and thus could have contributed to a natural transformation mediated LGT event in P stutzeri This mechanism of acquisition is supported by the fact that no phage genes transposase coding sequences IS elements or repeat sequences were found in the 25 7 kb cosmid clone that contains Ps moeZ 17 Three other P stutzeri isolates obtained from the American Type Culture Collection have been shown by Southern analysis to lack pdtc synthesis genes These same strains plus P aeruginosa PAO1 P putida mt2 and P fluorescens F113 were also shown not to produce pdtc 17 Pdtc production in bacteria other than P stutzeri strain KC is limited to P putida strain To8 and one other unclassified pseudomonad strain 36 P stutzeri and P putida are closely related both belonging to rRNA homology group I 37 so they may be descendants of the original pseudomonad that acquired moeZ by LGT The relative rarity of pdtc production among pseudomonads especially the P stutzeri strains is consistent with the hypothesis that Ps moeZ was acquired through LGT by strain KC Alternatively a pseudomonad ancestor could have contained the genes for and produced pdtc but this function could have been lost from most strains Loss of this function is plausible if pdtc production is a highly specialized function or is only required for survival in extreme or competitive environments Conclusions It is not known what function MoeZ performs in the mycobacteria and cyanbacteria species that contain it Indications are that in mycobacteria MSAE function is performed by MoeBR But in the fully sequenced cyanobacteria there are only MoeZs and no MSAE so in these organisms MSAE function may be fulfilled by MoeZ In either case MoeZ is essential to pdtc synthesis in P stutzeri strain KC and pdtc is a potent and versatile molecule Its capabilities of enhancing iron uptake and iron reduction make it a good candidate for a pathogenicity factor The role of MoeZ in the pathogenic mycobacteria and its impact on virulence of these strains should be investigated Materials and Methods Sequences were obtained from the GenBank non redundant nr sequence database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST searches were used to obtain the initial set of sequences similar to P stutzeri strain KC ORF F 38 The program BLAST 2 Sequences was used to obtain the degrees of similarity and homology among amino acid AA and nucleic acid NA sequences 39 Protein domains as codified by Pfam 26 were identified by searching the Conserved Domain Database using the Domain Architecture Retrieval Tool provided by GenBank Protein alignments were generated using the Clustal X program and
