 Booked Up Following a survey of our wall space plus of the attic the garage the basement and every closet in the house my wife has estimated that I own something on the order of 14 000 books enough she points out that if I read one a day for the rest of my life there s an excellent chance I won t live long enough to finish them all Still I keep buying books at an alarming rate That s only partly because I m attempting to deny my own mortality It s also because buying books is so much fun these days Of course there have always been plenty of ways to have fun buying books such as prowling through cavernous used book stores in search of hidden treasure or for Washington D C residents driving three hours through glorious Virginia countryside to attend the equally glorious Green Valley Book Fair But two recent innovations have ushered in a true golden age of obsessive book shopping You can head over to a luxurious store such as Barnes Noble lounge in comfortable chairs sip coffee and listen to music while you contemplate your selections Or if you prefer you can shop from a Web based service such as Amazon com which offers a sophisticated search engine reviews at your fingertips and best of all one click ordering Ordering from Amazon is so easy that I often come away from a virtual visit with the exhilarating sense of not having the vaguest idea how many books I ve just purchased By and large the amenities you get from Barnes Noble are quite a bit costlier to provide than the amenities you get from Amazon One reason B N feels so comfortable is that it s spacious and space costs money By letting you browse among physical books B N invites damage and theft The well stocked shelves require a substantial investment in inventory Amazon avoids most of those costs and it passes some of the savings on to the consumer popular hardbacks except for best sellers are typically about 20 percent cheaper at Amazon You can enjoy luxury at B N or you can enjoy convenience and low prices at Amazon So far so good The market offers a range of options Those options that provide consumers with sufficient value will thrive in the long run those that fail to justify their costs will face extinction If enough consumers are willing to pay B N prices for B N comfort B N will prosper if not not Either way economists will applaud the triumph of consumer sovereignty Likewise if enough consumers are willing to sacrifice physical browsing for Amazon discounts and convenience Amazon will prosper if not not Once again economists will stand ready to endorse the judgment of the marketplace But there s another potential outcome and it s one that economists would not endorse Some consumers browse in the comfortable atmosphere of Barnes Noble but then head home to buy their books from Amazon at discount prices In sufficient numbers such consumers could spell B N s demise Even in much smaller numbers those consumers surely limit B N s growth and its willingness to provide even greater comforts to its patrons It s one thing to watch a business fail because of its own inefficiency that s just the market doing its job But its quite another thing to watch a business fail because it s efficiently providing a service for which consumers have managed to avoid paying In the scenario I ve envisioned B N falls victim to the economic equivalent though not I think the moral equivalent of theft Among the ultimate losers are book shoppers themselves How can this disagreeable outcome be avoided One solution is for the bookstores to own the Web sites B N won t mind losing business to one of its own subsidiaries And to a certain extent that s happening It and other large superstores such as Borders has begun operating Amazon like sites But as long as Amazon itself remains independent and holds a substantial market share at least a part of the problem remains In principle publishers could come to B N s rescue by pressuring Amazon to raise its prices Amazon relies on publishers for timely book shipments so the instruments of pressure are readily at hand But publishers might or might not want to play that role On the one hand they have a considerable stake in the success of large and luxurious bookstores on the other hand they also have a considerable stake in the success of services like Amazon My friends in the publishing industry tell me that on balance they wish Amazon well At other times and in other industries things have gone the other way For many years the Schwinn Bicycle Co famously refused to supply bicycles to discounters In recent decades the manufacturers of mattresses patent medicines electronics equipment herbicides and light bulbs have insisted that their products be sold only at the full retail price Why would Schwinn want to maintain a high retail price for bicycles The naive explanation is that manufacturers always like high prices But that s too naive The price Schwinn cares about is the wholesale price and it controls that directly A more plausible story is that bicycle shoppers like to visit fancy showrooms with knowledgeable sales staffs but then buy from discounters Eventually retailers recognize that there is no reward to offering quality service and the fancy showrooms disappear Customers are made worse off and so is Schwinn as there is now less reason to prefer a Schwinn bicycle to others By forbidding its dealers to compete with each other via prices Schwinn forces them to compete with each other via quality of service to the ultimate benefit of consumers That was exactly the reasoning endorsed by the Supreme Court in 1988 when it upheld the right of Sharp Electronics to terminate the dealership of a chronic discounter In its Sharp decision the court showed an admirable understanding and respect for economic theory Not so the New York Times which editorially called for legislation to overturn the ruling The Times asked for compromise legislation that would give manufacturers the right to set high standards for service and refuse to supply retailers who don t meet them while denying manufacturers the right to set prices But in the presence of competition among dealers there is no difference between setting a standard of service and setting a retail price For a given service standard competition will lower the price until it s commensurate with the service standard and for a given price competition will raise the service standard until it s commensurate with the price The Times prescription is comparable to allowing people to choose how much to sleep while forbidding them from choosing how much to stay awake the reality is that you can t choose one without choosing the other So as the Supreme Court recognized discounters can be clearly detrimental to both manufacturers and consumers in the market for electronics or bicycles But when it comes to books the analysis is a lot less clear cut and here s why A discount bicycle dealer offers nothing but low prices whereas a Web based discount book dealer also offers special services you can t get from a bookstore such as the convenience of shopping from home That s why bicycle and electronics firms have been so keen to stop the discounters while publishers have laid out a tentative welcome mat
