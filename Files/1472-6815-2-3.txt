 Background Approximately 40 million people in the United States experience chronic tinnitus 10 million of these people consider their tinnitus to be a significant problem 1 Hazell 2 reported that 17 of the population in the United Kingdom has chronic tinnitus but only 14 of those people experiencing tinnitus said that it bothers them a great deal Innumerable treatments for this condition have been utilized with varying degrees of success by clinicians and patients The goal of effective tinnitus management is not necessarily to mask or remove the patient s physical perception of tinnitus sounds In many cases this is not even possible According to Duckro et al 3 the treatment of chronic tinnitus is more accurately described in terms of management rather than cure Several studies have demonstrated that the matched loudness of tinnitus is not correlated with its severity 4 5 6 Tinnitus severity can be defined and quantified several ways by how much or how often a patient is bothered by tinnitus by how much or how often tinnitus detracts from the patient s enjoyment of life or by how disabling patients perceive their tinnitus to be Various instruments have been developed to assess tinnitus severity These include the Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire 7 the Tinnitus Severity Index 8 and the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory 9 Regardless of which assessment instrument is used the goal of tinnitus management programs should be to reduce the severity of each patient s tinnitus That is clinicians should help patients to learn how to pay less attention to their tinnitus so that it bothers them less of the time A realistic goal of an effective tinnitus management program is to help patients understand and gain control over their tinnitus rather than tinnitus having control over them Ultimately clinicians should strive to help patients progress to the point where tinnitus is no longer a negative factor in their lives Many studies have been undertaken to assess the effectiveness of tinnitus management programs or methods Some of these studies assessed tinnitus severity before treatment was initiated and assessed it again immediately after the treatment program was concluded 10 11 12 Other studies included a follow up assessment of tinnitus severity usually in the form of a questionnaire two weeks 13 four weeks 14 six weeks 15 three months 16 or six months 17 after the conclusion of a treatment program Few studies of the efficacy of tinnitus treatments have assessed their longer term effects on tinnitus severity This is an important point to consider because patients perception of their tinnitus often changes with time For example in their study of more than 1300 patients Scott et al 18 made the following observations discomfort from tinnitus and reported loudness of tinnitus increased however tolerance to tinnitus improved as the time from tinnitus onset increased The importance of long term follow up assessment is illustrated by the results of a study by Lindberg et al 19 This investigation assessed tinnitus severity in 20 patients nine months after they had completed a relaxation distraction counseling program Scott et al 14 had published the effects of this treatment program on these same patients based on assessments administered pre treatment and again four weeks after the conclusion of counseling Scott et al reported that the patients improved significantly in discomfort and irritation from tinnitus as well as in depression and reported loudness of tinnitus However based on results from the nine month follow up questionnaire Lindberg et al 19 reported that significant improvement remained for only discomfort from tinnitus Patients follow up responses to the other severity measures were no longer significantly different from pre treatment values Vesterager 20 mailed questionnaires to 154 tinnitus patients 0 5 to 4 5 years median 2 2 years after they attended an audiology clinic in Denmark The treatment program included patient education and reassurance psychological counseling hearing aids and maskers as appropriate Tinnitus severity was evaluated prior to the initiation of treatment by scoring patients responses in several areas of complaint including sleep problems quality of life concentration problems sensitivity to stress irritability and fear of serious illness Patients also rated the loudness of their tinnitus When pre treatment responses were compared to those from follow up questionnaires Vesterager reported that the most severely afflicted patients showed significant improvements in getting to sleep concentration and self rated loudness of tinnitus Sanchez Stephens 21 surveyed 86 patients 18 60 months after they attended the Tinnitus Clinic of the Welch Hearing Institute In general patients reported more benefits 2 8 per respondent than shortcomings 0 8 per respondent regarding their attendance at this clinic Specific benefits reported by patients included being fitted with a hearing aid or tinnitus masker positive characteristics of the staff and the opportunity to discuss tinnitus with informed clinicians Specific shortcomings included patient perceptions that clinic treatments were ineffective and the persistence of problematic tinnitus after clinic attendance Andersson et al 22 used questionnaires to assess tinnitus distress and the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy CBT in a group of patients 3 10 years average 4 9 years after they attended a series of appointments at Uppsala University Sweden A majority 59 of patients who received CBT exhibited reductions in tinnitus related distress over time In general patients tolerance of tinnitus increased between the time of their initial appointment and the follow up questionnaire Maskability of tinnitus at admission was a predictor of tinnitus related distress at follow up The present study was undertaken for the following reasons 1 to assess long term changes in tinnitus severity exhibited by patients who completed a comprehensive tinnitus management program 2 to identify factors that contributed to changes in tinnitus severity within this population 3 to contribute to the development and refinement of effective assessment and management procedures for tinnitus Methods Detailed questionnaires were mailed to 300 consecutive patients prior to their initial appointment at the Oregon Health Science University Tinnitus Clinic between 1998 2001 These questionnaires requested information about patients medical hearing and tinnitus histories 23 The Appendix contains twelve questions that constitute the Tinnitus Severity Index 8 24 an efficient indicator of the negative impacts of tinnitus upon patients see Appendix additional file 1 An abbreviated version of the Beck Depression Inventory aBDI was also included 25 Patients rated the loudness of their usual tinnitus on a 1 to 10 scale see Appendix additional file 1 Information from these questionnaires was entered into a database known as the Oregon Tinnitus Data Registry 26 Additional File Tinnitus Severity Questions Click here for file The initial appointment at the clinic had the following format 1 The Tinnitus Management Team composed of an otolaryngologist a neurophysiologist and an audiologist reviewed questionnaires and medical records prior to meeting each patient 2 Patients met with all Management Team members for an in depth interview and review of their medical hearing tinnitus and psychosocial histories and conditions Patients received education about possible causes of tinnitus as well as reassurance and counseling regarding factors that could exacerbate or improve their condition 3 Otolaryngological and neurological examinations 4 Audiological evaluations including pure tone air and bone conduction thresholds speech perception in quiet and noise MCL UCL tympanometry 5 Tinnitus evaluations that included matching tinnitus to sounds played through headphones determination of minimum masking levels measurements of residual inhibition see Johnson 1998 for a description of these procedures 6 Evaluations of acoustic therapies based on the patient s audiological evaluations various devices were described and demonstrated These could include hearing aids in the ear sound generators tinnitus instruments combinations of hearing aids sound generators tabletop sound generation machines Sound Pillows tapes or CDs 7 The Tinnitus Management Team reviewed the results of evaluations and explained them to the patient 8 Recommendations were formulated and explained to the patient Referral and contact information regarding medical or psychiatric evaluations psychological counseling and other recommended services or products was also provided 9 Follow up patients were encouraged contact the clinic anytime if they had questions and also to inform us of their progress If they did not call us first we contacted patients by telephone one and three months after their initial appointment Follow up questionnaires were mailed to the same 300 patients 6 to 36 months after their initial appointment These protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at Oregon Health Science University Informed consent was obtained in writing from patients prior to their participation in this study Data relating to patient demographics audiometric thresholds self rated according to the 1 to 10 scale in the Appendix additional file 1 tinnitus loudness tinnitus severity sleep interference and aBDI scores were analyzed mean values were calculated and compared using analyses of variance and paired two tailed t tests Results Tinnitus duration At the time of their initial appointment patients reported that their tinnitus had been present for the durations listed in Table 1 Audiometric data Table 2contains the grand averaged pure tone air conduction thresholds for 190 patients who returned follow up questionnaires This pattern of high frequency sensorineural hearing loss is typical for our clinic population Approximately 90 of the patients who are evaluated in our clinic have some degree of hearing loss The fact that males traditionally had a greater amount of noise exposure in military service in the workplace and during recreational activities contributes to the higher percentage of males in the present study and in our general tinnitus clinic population 70 in both cases Self rated loudness of tinnitus Table 3contains means standard deviations and a statistical comparison paired two tailed t test of patients ratings of the loudness of their tinnitus on the initial and follow up questionnaires There was a statistically significant reduction in self rated tinnitus loudness at the time of the follow up questionnaire compared to the initial questionnaire Tinnitus Severity Index scores Table 3also contains means standard deviations and statistical comparisons of patients responses to twelve questions that comprise the Tinnitus Severity Index A repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance was performed on these data to control for the number of comparisons as well as for the fact that the same subjects responded to both the initial and follow up questions The overall Wilks Lambda F value was 5 29 with p 0 0001 This indicated that there was a significant change in responses on the follow up questionnaire and allowed us to proceed with univariate tests P values resulting from univariate comparisons of initial and follow up responses to each of the twelve tinnitus severity questions are listed in Table 3 Using an alpha of 0 05 the Bonferroni correction produced a significance level of 0 004 for each of these items According to the statistical criteria outlined in the previous paragraph patients in the present study reported significant improvement in eleven of the twelve Tinnitus Severity Index questions The only question that did not exhibit significant change was Does your tinnitus make it uncomfortable to be in a quiet room Consequently this group of patients exhibited a significant reduction in total Tinnitus Severity Index score between the time of their initial clinic appointment and the follow up questionnaire Sleep interference Table 4contains patients responses to the question Does your tinnitus interfere with sleep on both the initial and follow up questionnaires Compared to the initial questionnaire there was a significant increase in the number of patients who did not experience sleep interference at the time of follow up X 2 6 92 p 0 05 Sleep patterns of 51 patients 26 8 improved at least one category between initial and follow up questionnaires that is from often to sometimes or from sometimes to no sleep interference Sleep patterns of 26 patients 13 7 worsened at least one category and sleep patterns of the remaining 113 patients 59 5 stayed the same on initial and follow up questionnaires Table 5contains mean Tinnitus Severity Index scores for these three groups of patients Patients with frequent sleep disturbances scored significantly higher on the other eleven tinnitus severity items on both initial and follow up questionnaires than patients with fewer sleep disturbances Patients whose sleep patterns improved at least one category exhibited a significant reduction in Tinnitus Severity Index score Patients whose sleep patterns did not change exhibited a smaller degree of improvement in tinnitus severity However the Tinnitus Severity scores of patients whose sleep patterns worsened did not change significantly In fact Tinnitus Severity Index scores for those 26 patients tended to be higher at the time of follow up compared to their responses on the initial questionnaire Depression Mean aBDI scores for 190 patients in the present study were as follows 5 16 5 32 on the initial questionnaire 5 91 6 55 at follow up According to Beck Beck 25 a score of 5 7 on this version of their Inventory can indicate mild depression In the present study there was no significant change in aBDI scores for the group However 64 patients 33 7 reported that they were experiencing depression at the time of their initial tinnitus clinic appointment 44 patients 23 2 reported that they were experiencing depression at the time of the follow up questionnaire This is a significant reduction in the number of patients reporting current depression X 2 5 17 p 0 02 Patients were divided into three groups based on the following criteria 28 patients whose initial Beck Depression Inventory score decreased by 3 or more points on the follow up questionnaire 50 patients whose Beck Depression score increased by 3 or more points on follow up 112 patients whose follow up Beck Depression score stayed within 0 2 points of their initial score Table 6contains mean Beck Depression Inventory scores for these three groups of patients A score of 0 4 on this questionnaire indicates no or minimal depression a score of 5 7 can indicate mild depression a score of 8 15 can indicate moderate depression 25 The mean Beck Depression Inventory score for 28 patients was 10 57 on the initial questionnaire and 3 54 on the follow up questionnaire According to Beck Beck 25 this indicates group improvement from moderate depression to minimal or no depression The mean Beck Depression Inventory score for 50 patients increased from 5 24 on the initial questionnaire to 12 79 at follow up This is a significant increase for the group from mild to moderate depression The final group of 112 patients exhibited no significant change in Beck Depression Inventory score they continued to exhibit no or minimal depression Table 7contains means of Tinnitus Severity Index scores for these three groups of patients Patients whose Beck Depression score decreased 3 or more points exhibited significant reductions in Tinnitus Severity Index scores Patients whose follow up Beck Depression score stayed within 0 2 points of their initial Beck score exhibited a smaller degree of improvement in tinnitus severity However patients whose initial Beck Depression score increased 3 or more points on the follow up questionnaire did not exhibit significant changes in Tinnitus Severity Index scores Discussion Patient education reassurance and demystification of tinnitus During their initial clinic appointment all patients received information about the most likely cause of their tinnitus and about factors that can either exacerbate or improve the condition A better understanding of the mechanisms of tinnitus and a review of effective management strategies can reduce anxiety associated with the fear of the unknown experienced by many patients 27 Tinnitus education provided a great deal of reassurance for patients Medical examinations and tests provided additional reassurance that their tinnitus was not a symptom of a degenerative or potentially fatal condition The process of patient education and reassurance helps to demystify tinnitus and can facilitate a reduction in the severity of this symptom Patients in the study by Sanchez Stephens 21 reported that the opportunity to discuss tinnitus with informed staff was one of the most beneficial aspects of their clinic appointment Acoustic therapy Acoustic therapy is using external sounds to provide relief or distraction from tinnitus This is a vital component of an effective tinnitus management program All of our patients use acoustic therapy in one or more of its forms There are numerous techniques and devices that can help patients to increase their exposure to safe and pleasant external sounds in order to decrease their awareness of tinnitus This strategy has multiple advantages and benefits Acoustic therapy is non invasive and has no adverse side effects Patients often obtain immediate relief from or reduced perception of their tinnitus Patients can use external sounds to exert some control over their tinnitus This often results in reduced patient frustration and anxiety Some patients experience residual inhibition tinnitus suppression or temporary disappearance following exposure to external sounds Acoustic therapy can facilitate patients habituation to tinnitus That is increasing the level of external sounds within safe limits can help patients learn to pay less attention to their tinnitus If tinnitus becomes less noticeable patients will be bothered by it less of the time Increased exposure to external sounds within safe limits increases blood flow throughout the auditory system This helps to nourish and maintain auditory structures and might also contribute to healing processes when possible Increased exposure to external sounds over time could contribute to reorganizations of neural pathways responsible for tinnitus generation and perception Reductions of superfluous activity within the central auditory system might result in permanent reductions in tinnitus perception Depending on test results and individual preferences patients can increase the level of pleasant sounds in any environment by using hearing aids in the ear sound generators tinnitus instruments combinations of hearing aids sound generators tabletop sound generation machines Sound Pillows tapes or CDs Improvements in sleep patterns Patients whose sleep patterns improved at least one category exhibited a 32 reduction in Tinnitus Severity Index score on the follow up questionnaire Improvements in sleep patterns experienced by these patients were attributable to several factors medications additions of pleasant sounds to the bedroom reduced anxiety improved coping strategies attention switching and relaxation techniques and psychological counseling When appropriate patients with insomnia were advised to talk with their physicians about the occasional use of over the counter or prescription medications that might improve their sleep patterns In cases of severe and persistent insomnia that did not improve by implementation of our recommendations patients were referred to specialized sleep clinics for evaluation and treatment The fact that improvements in sleep interference contributed to improvements in overall ratings of tinnitus severity underscores the importance of identifying and effectively treating insomnia Psychological counseling Some directive counseling occurred during the initial clinic appointment including advice about relaxation and attention switching techniques and identification of problems including insomnia depression anxiety stress anger and obsessive compulsive tendencies that might require long term psychotherapy Patients who would benefit from ongoing psychotherapy were referred to psychiatrists or psychologists near their home Andersson et al 22 demonstrated that cognitive behavioral therapy can help to reduce tinnitus related distress for a majority of patients Treatment for anxiety and depression Patients who reported high levels of stress or anxiety were referred to psychiatrists or psychologists for evaluation and treatment In the present study patients exhibited significant reductions in tinnitus related anxiety as reflected by their responses to the following questions on initial and follow up questionnaires see Table 3 Does your tinnitus make you feel irritable or nervous Does your tinnitus make you feel tired or stressed Does your tinnitus make it difficult for you to relax Psychiatric evaluations were recommended a for all patients who reported current depression b for patients who scored 8 or higher on the aBDI at the time of their initial appointment Ongoing psychotherapy was also recommended for these patients Even though there was no significant change in mean aBDI scores for the group as a whole there was a significant reduction in the number of patients who reported current depression at the time of follow up 44 compared to the initial clinic appointment 64 Patients whose initial aBDI scores decreased 3 or more points on the follow up questionnaire exhibited a 33 reduction in Tinnitus Severity Index scores Patients whose initial aBDI scores increased 3 or more points on the follow up questionnaire did not exhibit any significant changes in tinnitus severity These results underscore the importance of identifying and effectively treating depression Previous studies demonstrated that tinnitus severity is positively correlated with patients degree of depression 28 insomnia 29 and anxiety 6 Effective treatment of these co symptoms with psychological counseling in conjunction with medications often reduces the severity of patients tinnitus A common question is Did improvements in insomnia anxiety and depression lead to improvements in tinnitus severity or did a reduction in tinnitus severity precipitate improvements in these co symptoms Halford Anderson 30 gave an excellent answer to this chicken and egg conundrum It is considered that the causal relationship between these psychological variables and tinnitus severity is likely to be bi directional Lifestyle changes Based on findings from questionnaires patient interviews and testing specific recommendations were made to some individuals regarding the following recreational and occupational noise exposure medications diet exercise employment socialization acoustic therapy Patients were referred to other professionals for evaluation and treatment when necessary Follow up Patients were encouraged to contact the tinnitus clinic any time during business hours if they had questions or concerns Patients who ordered in the ear devices required follow up appointments for fittings and adjustments If we did not hear from them first we called patients one week one and three months after their initial appointment Follow up questionnaires were mailed to patients six months and one year after their initial appointment Additional questionnaires are sometimes sent to patients years later Clinician initiated contact at regular intervals after the initial appointment is important for several reasons to let patients know that clinicians are committed to helping them to address patients questions or concerns to check patients compliance with recommendations to modify recommendations or to suggest different strategies when necessary to assess the effectiveness of the tinnitus management program We reminded patients that recommendations made to them at the conclusion of their initial appointment in the clinic are starting points If a patient follows all of the initial recommendations and yet the severity of his tinnitus does not improve over the course of six months we either suggested different strategies for him to try or asked the patient to return to the clinic for re evaluation and additional counseling Different devices and tinnitus management strategies might be described or demonstrated during the follow up appointment Particular recommendations were then reinforced or modified Conclusions Identification and treatment of patients experiencing anxiety insomnia or depression are vital components of an effective tinnitus management program Utilization of acoustic therapy also contributed to improvements exhibited by patients in the present study Individualized treatment programs that were designed for each patient contributed to the overall improvement in tinnitus severity reported on follow up questionnaires Several clinicians agree that a combination of tinnitus management strategies is more effective than one form of remediation used in isolation 16 27 31 32 Even though a customized combination of recommendations is effective for many patients with chronic and bothersome tinnitus the process can be very time consuming The time required for patient assessment education reassurance and counseling as well as for designing and initiating an individualized tinnitus management program can take more than four hours during the initial appointment Follow up appointments can last two hours or more Most family physicians and otolaryngologists are not able to spend even a small fraction of this much time with one patient during an office visit If a clinician has assessed and treated every reasonable medical cause for a patient s tinnitus and the patient reports little improvement in tinnitus severity the clinician should refer the patient to a comprehensive tinnitus management program with experienced personnel who are willing and able to spend a substantial amount of time with each patient Because chronic tinnitus has several characteristics and co symptoms in common with chronic pain pain management strategies can be effective for some tinnitus patients 6 32
