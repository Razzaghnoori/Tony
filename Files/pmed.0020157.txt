                            Turner and Tramr provide a cogent argument in favor of the ethical use of placebo        controls despite proven effective treatment  However they are wide of the mark        citing the APPROVe trial in support of their position Because there is no established        treatment to prevent adenomatous polyps few commentators would have any objections to the        use of placebo controls in this study Nevertheless they are right to suggest that it        would have been desirable to have included a placebo control in the VIGOR study to provide        a more rigorous assessment of safety Whether all things considered a placebo control        would have been ethical in this study of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis is        debatable        Another issue not discussed in this         PLoS Medicine Debate is the value of placebo controls in early proof of        concept efficacy trials despite the existence of established treatment The efficiency of        seeking a rigorous efficacy signal before moving on to largerscale trials and exposing as        few subjects as possible to drugs that might not work or turn out to be toxic is a valid        ethical reason for using placebo controls provided subjects are not exposed to undue risks        of harm from withholding established treatment
