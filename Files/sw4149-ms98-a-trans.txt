        Wendy i guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if uh if that may be the case and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that uh     right   let me ask you the question do you have a uh budget or a monthly budget or a long term budget that you stick to   right now im in college and im on work study and so my budget comes from my dads help   umhum uhhuh   he helps me out a lot and i get paid monthly so thats kind of hard to have a budget my mother uh doesnt get paid much money so her budget is um  just uh planning for IRAs   i see i see well good im im kind of in a different situation but i i i went through that too when i was in school but uh i was i was working to get through college and and uh trying to make it through that but uh       im married and have uh a couple of children and we have to uh pretty much stick to a budget im on a salary so i dont get any overtime or anything like that so   uhhuh oh   but we have a fixed income and we have to make sure that uh every dollar we have is is spent accordingly and um what we try and do to to stick to our monthly budget is we pretty much have you know the house payment we have the insurance premiums   uhhuh   um utilities and so forth and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know were going to spend and set that money aside and we also try and set aside money for savings set aside money for the college the kids education college education the future and uh   umhum   set aside money for bonds and and we also set aside an emergency fund because   that sounds good   weve uh  weve been married for about ten years and we find out that you know no matter what kind of budget you stick on theres always going to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house that you have to have money for and uh   right   its not enough to go in to take a loan out but uh you have to have money for   right   and uh then we have you know whatevers left over is disposable income disposable disposable yeah discretionary income       that we use for the rest of the month so and its worked out very well its uh its helped us so that we havent been you know too long on the month and too short on the money and uh try and stick with that and nice thing about it i uh my wife is   well thats good   is excellent in that we both work together we both have a budget and we stick to it and theres no surprises in that   well good with two kids that could be hard   well actually i have four kids   four   so  yeah i said a couple of kids i i guess i should have specified i have four   oh my goodness   four little boys yeah   four boys oh my goodness its just me and my sister   you bet you bet all right   and my parents divorced three years ago and my sister had gotten through college but i was still in high school and my mother paid for a lot of my sisters college while my parents were together   umhum yes   and then uh before the divorce she had saved for my college   uhhuh   but uh when we had the divorce she just didnt get much money out of it and had to spend it all on getting another house   oh   so now my dads paying for all of my college  and financial aid and scholarships im a music major so i have auditions coming up   well good good uhhuh yes well what year are you in college   im a sophomore   youre a sophomore so you have a few more years   right right ill ill probably have about two two and a half years left   uhhuh well good for you good for you yeah i imagine it uh is a little difficult to stick with a budget during uh during school and so forth   oh it sure is i i know how much my dad is going to give me every two weeks and i and i dont spend over that   yes well great great and sometimes thats a little hard with books and music and and sheet music and stuff youve got to work on too   oh sure theres theres always music books to buy   lab fees  oh yes oh yes well youre not a starving artist yet are you   oh no no no i dont plan on being a starving artist  thats why im in college   good well good there theres enough of those in the world huh   right   good good im glad to hear that Wendy well   thats usually because theyre not real educated they cant afford to  have a really good job   whos whos not very well educated   the starving ones theres enough out there that if you have if youre educated enough then you can make money   oh yes yes thats true thats true ive found that out       so thats why im planning and and preparing for the uh education of my children also try and set that money aside   right what did you major in   i majored in business administration   well good you know plenty about planning a budget a budget   and um yeah but uh once again
