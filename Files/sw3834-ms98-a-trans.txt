                  in dollars and lives and the long term effects   uhhuh well uh   you ready i ill hit it if youre ready to start okay   oh im ready yeah sure   my names Karen by the way what whats your name   Karen my names John Benyak where do you live   San Francisco   oh i live in Dallas   oh nice to meet you   just outside of Dallas       nice talking to you whats that mean were ready to go   ready to go   okay well it uh the way it turned out it wasnt worth anything really i just dont think ive always thought that uh it just wasnt carried on the way it should have been it wasnt carried on like a war i mean if we were in there to fight a war regardless of the reason we were there it should have been fought like a war it just uh   what would that how would that have been different if it had been fought like a war   we well i think wed uh wed uh beat them i dont think uh i dont know what would have happened twenty years later down the road with the country within and with us but uh i think if wed uh had allowed the military people to conduct it like a war instead of letting the politicians and the and the peace  and people like that dictate the terms of the way we fought i think things would have turned out a lot differently   you you think it was a winnable war then   oh yes yeah i mean it was just a two bit country always was and always will be and uh or at least it is now and theres no way that if wed uh been able to take uh use the capacity that we had the potential we had to fight a war against a country like that we would have uh what would have lost it as a war the long term effects well   uhhuh   uh i dont know thats thats a little tougher to answer i think uh depends i guess on whos in office but uh i think Bush used that uh last year in the Persian Gulf uh by taking some stronger stronger measures and when the war started   you mean the effects of of Vietnam being to encourage him to to be more defensive in his posture and go for   be more or be more offensive well once the war started once they decided   i meant offensive im sorry uhhuh   once they decided to fight the thing we take a take a much uh run in there and do it as quickly as possible rather than let the thing drag on i guess what happened back in Vietnam is that uh they we escalated and uh just you know on a gradual basis and gave the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong time to adjust to our uh increases in uh personnel and so forth they just didnt go in there if theyd a sent five hundred thousand troops in there at one time initially uh i think things would have been would have been differently but different but it they went from having the advisors uh up to that four hundred to five hundred thousand troops over a period of time a long a long number of years and as i said i think the uh   uhhuh   the enemy just gradually adjusted to that   um   and they didnt uh the people the country the people here didnt want the war the way it turned out they didnt want it   i do think one of the effects was that the uh people involved in that kind of an um activity were surprised at the power that the media had on um intervening and probably   uhhuh   set the tone for medias involved then in future whether it was a war activity or   right   something along those lines that are going to involve a number of people   really right well there are   everything changed after that in terms of media   well there were every every night youd come home from work and uh or school or whatever and see it on the uh the news i imagine that wasnt the case during World War Two or any of the other wars uh people just didnt feel like they had the involvement in it and there were a lot of   uhhuh   a lot of   well you remember in the Gulf War they made a specific effort not to repeat the mistakes that the media they felt the media made in   uhhuh   Vietnam war they werent about to have people in there reporting   right right yeah but uh i just uh i i guess i was in my lets see my twenties during during most of that war and i i never did think that they were were doing it right im just not a uh a fan of Jane Fonda and people like her i mean that shed go around speaking on different campuses and   uhhuh   getting people uh aroused about the whole thing and of course uh they always talked about the vocal minority and i guess thats what it was the solid majority and the vocal minority   um   people were listening to to her and i guess politicians were too but i just felt i was in the service at that time i wasnt over there but i just felt that they fought the thing i mean they just didnt fight it like they should have and its a war whether a war is right or wrong you i mean if youre over there and   uhhuh   people or young people men or women are dying they ought to fight it as a war and either win or lose based on the fact that its a war and not just uh uh mealy mouth their their way through the thing and try to get the other side to give up on the basis of what they thought we had in terms of power and so forth   that approach probably would have shortened the time that we were over there too at least   oh yeah it would sure shorten the time and reduce the number of casualties and so forth we might have lost i i i just dont think we could have lost   uhhuh uhhuh
