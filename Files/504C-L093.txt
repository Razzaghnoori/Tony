 July 10 1993 Dear Herron Student Family Perhaps you have heard your student talk about the visiting artists who present slide lectures at Herron about their work sit in on classes and mingle with the students Some six artists visit Herron each year from allover the country These are artists who are either emerging as leaders in their fields or who have already become well known The visiting Artists Program is a critical component of the Herron curriculum as it exposes the students to artists who are successfully supporting themselves with their art and to the most current art trends outside of Indiana Each year funding is sought through grants and gifts from individuals Grants are becoming harder to secure and we must look to the generosity of individuals to sustain the program The funding covers transportation lodging and lecture fees for the artists and publicity In total the program costs about 10 000per year I am asking for the support of the families of Herron students to help maintain this vital program We feel that it is of great importance to the curriculum and helps to broaden your student s Herron experience Simply fill out the enclosed form and return it with your donation to Herron All checks should be made payable to Herron IUF Any gift will be greatly appreciated Feel free to join us for any of the lectures which are held October April in our auditorium Contact my office in the fall for the schedule and listing of this years artists Sincerely William J Voos Dean
