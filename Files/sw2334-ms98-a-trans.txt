        all right   well like i told you before   and youre talking about  credit cards   umhum   we put ours up i mean i had a delightful evening one  night cutting a bunch of those suckers up   um i wish i had   well you should try it   well i it was done for me after a while i had a uh i had a business going and this was back in the eighties i dont know if you remember the gold and silver prices and all that but uh i had a coin shop and everything was going great while gold and silver was up and it started falling   yeah   so i started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards and things got worse and worse and finally boom   you lost your business oh God what a nightmare   yep yeah yeah it was i ended up going into bankruptcy you know it was one of those things  uh oh itll get better next week you know  things will pick up and so there i was in old bankruptcy court   well you werent charging gold and silver were you you cant do that can you   oh yeah yeah   oh you can   oh yeah yeah i was buying from other dealers and uh you know they take payment any way they can get it   oh thats a nightmare   yeah course on on stuff that i was on merchandise that i was buying on cards it was i was getting the money back because i was selling it i wasnt buying you know just to hold onto it um but it was things like you know rent and phone bills and advertising and all that other good stuff that ate them all up   um   so   well  i remember before i got married you know when you graduate from college theyll send you all those credit card applications you know of course you fill them all out because youre honored right and uh   umhum umhum sure   i had stuff for like Sanger Harris and you know it got up like to couple of hundred dollars and i thought well thats okay cause all they wanted was ten dollars a month right  i wasnt thinking a thing about it   umhum yes thats the way they suck you in   yeah i was just stupid and every time they had a sale there i was because you know got get such good bargains   umhum umhum   and i dont know   well just today in the mail i got uh i got got my guaranteed acceptance by uh American Express   oh yeah weve been getting those   yeah   i went back to school and got my Masters and they started sending those things to me again   yeah as soon as your a graduate student they get your name   yeah they did   and uh course i guess i guess ive been purged from their records i used to have an American Express uh back when i had my business i got one   uhhuh   and they they goofed up bad on my first on my very first bill because i was using the American Express strictly for the travel expenses   yeah   and the bill would come in and id pay it and the very first bill i paid it and then i got this nasty letter from them saying youre overdue pay so i i said well it just crossed in the mail so i didnt do anything about it Two weeks later i get another letter even nastier and said were going to turn this over to our attorneys if you dont pay and i looked at that and i said uhhuh so by this time my checks had come back from the bank so i made a copy of the check that they had cashed   hum   attached it to their letter and sent them a nasty letter with the card cut in little bitty pieces saying thanks but no thanks   and now they werent check in   yeah they were i tell you they dont talk about theyre charging that enormous fee every year   now what is it now   its up to fifty five on the gold card its eighty five for the Optima oh im sorry fifty fifty   what do you mean fifty five you mean fifty five dollars   yeah for the green card and it   but then whats the interest   well now thats the card see   and interest is like eighteen or something   oh yeah yeah its um well of course on the green card you have to pay it when the bill comes in so there isnt any but on the Optima card its um lets see right now its running at about its not too bad its actually its about sixteen and a half percent which is pretty good as far as credit cards go   yeah well credit cards   well theyre dangerous   you know my parents dont hardly use them   humum mine dont either mine dont either they have um my mom has a uh has a MasterCard and a Visa card and thats it   ive got all my gas cards because i dont want to carry money around ill do that   yeah yeah now i i do use gas cards   now Impact is kind of bad too though   yeah  yeah yeah   you know especially if you get forget to record those little suckers   oh yeah exactly         uh plastic is just too easy i mean thats the thats the whole problem with it um have   uhhuh well and youre tempted if youve got cash a little bit of cash and you dont have enough for the purchase right   yeah   of course you got to charge it and keep your cash   sure naturally thats i got in all kinds of trouble doing that   what what are you saying oh uh my husband says i might buy it but i i dont really usually consider that an option           well   maybe thats how we got in trouble   having having having been out of the credit game for some years now ive ive gotten used to either paying in cash or not getting it and uh   yeah but its hard isnt it   well it is but i i im kind of uh grateful for the experience because its taught me a lot of restraint uh   well it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic   yeah exactly i i um i just went out and got a new VCR yesterday   with cash   with cash       and it its   do you work with TI   no no i wish i did   no yeah you could have got a discount couldnt you   yeah i could use a discount  i have to wait for the things to go on sale   but theres always a sell   yeah especially on electronic goods   yeah   especially now   what is that thing i saw Circuit Circuit world or something   oh Circuit City   Circuit City have you been in that   yeah they theyre not their prices arent that terrific they they used to be but theyve gotten theyve got to pay for all that national advertising now   oh its national   umhum   i think ive seen two around Dallas   yeah theyre theyre all over the country now they uh they they used to be good i remember when they first opened up they did have good bargains   well what else   i dont know if you have a place there called uh or you probably have something similar we call it Service Merchandise   yeah in Garland   you you got Service Merchandise yeah it used to be Service Merchandise was the place to go   uhhuh   and uh Circuit City came along and that was the place to go to get your TVs and washer and dryers and refrigerators and all that and then after the years went by they just sort of kept creeping up on price and actually Service Merchandise is cheaper than them now so so so much for Circuit City   sure okay what else can we talk about who do you work for   i dont im a graduate student im a professional student   we were talking about that just today   it is its its great   we could be just lifelong students   it is great i

engineering   so youre working on your doctorate   yeah   oh lord   yeah PhD in human factors   oh thatll thatll sound wonderful wont it   well   get you a little name plaque   oh yeah IBM uh i mean uh a lot of people use human factors folks but IBM is what im looking at right now   arent arent they laying off several thousand people   they might be but not at not at the human factors level   well i heard it on the news today i could swear it was IBM   there there um no as a matter of fact the IBM right here or in Carey which is a little suburb of Raleigh just just hired one more human factors person doggone it if theyd just waited a little bit longer it could have been me   hum how much longer do you have   um im im im going into thesis or going into the uh dissertation this summer   and get that done this summer   uh im going to start this summer i probably wont finish it until the end of the year but uh im im trying to get a uh   ooh   a uh intern position with IBM right now so that i can find an area to do my dissertation in its hard finding an area to do a dissertation in this field   because you   but   why there been so much work done already   yeah thats that and and
