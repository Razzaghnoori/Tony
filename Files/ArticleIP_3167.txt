 I Yadda Yadda Yadda I Language we all know allows us to say something Yet it is also frequently called upon to say nothing There are semantically and grammatically complex ways of doing this as study of the transcript of any Eisenhower press conference will demonstrate There are also sundry off the rack locutions that can dress up language to similar effect such as the long established blah blah blah which in a famous Far Side cartoon is what animals perceive human beings to be saying to one another In recent months in contexts where I have grown accustomed to expect a resigned or satiric blah blah blah I have been hearing the phrase yadda yadda yadda instead as in First they tell me one thing then they tell me another thing yadda yadda yadda My own informal tracking conducted over a period of several weeks suggests a blah blah blah displacement rate of about 50 percent in the thirtysomething and under demographic segment In attempting to walk back the cat to use the increasingly prevalent argot of the intelligence services for tracing a chain of events backward to establish a point of origin I have found yadda yadda yadda strands in episodes of Seinfeld and Home Improvement The most compelling manifestation though is in an advertisement for Converse athletic shoes featuring images of Kevin Johnson of the Phoenix Suns that was aired on national television during last spring s basketball championships Plus he don t badmouth anybody He don t cop an attitude Ffff You d have to be nuts not to want a guy like that on your team So anyways KJ KJ he s our man Ya ta da Ya ta da Ya ta da Converse The man who wrote the copy Richard Herstek the creative director at a Boston based advertising agency recalls that he had four seconds to fill in a 30 second commercial Yadda yadda yadda whose spelling he was uncertain of simply seemed funnier than blah blah blah or et cetera et cetera Why did the term occur to Herstek at all An associate of his from more than a decade ago he says used it from time to time along with a lot of other phrases that sounded Yiddish The various lexicographers I have consulted are quite certain however that yadda yadda yadda is not of Yiddish origin Although the term is known to have been around for a while documentary evidence for it is sparse as is so often the case in matters involving oral culture Richard Herstek indicated that he like me was now hearing yadda yadda yadda more frequently than ever but he modestly disclaimed responsibility True our experience could simply be the result of what might be called the Awareness Tautology One s sense of a phenomenon s pervasiveness is heightened by the fact of one s having been alerted to the phenomenon in the first place Still yadda yadda yadda s nascent currency is indirectly confirmed by the matter of fact use in the Los Angeles Times of the term in the participial phrase doing the yadda yadda Two things are happening First a newly prominent form of what is known as sound symbolism is crowding out some older ones in competition for a familiar piece of habitat English has long had various ways of mimicking the generic sound of spoken language the noise of a crowd or idle chatter chatter being such a word The class of onomatopoeic and reduplicative terms for spoken language is large blather buzz buzz chitchat fiddle faddle jibber jabber yakety yak yuk yuk The earliest appearances of something resembling yadda yadda yadda in print derive from its use in sound symbolic fashion as in this exchange from a short story about anthropomorphic ducks appearing in a 1949 issue of the Saturday Evening Post Stop it Mike Minnie would call crossly Pay attention to your flying for pity s sake Back seat flying Mike would grumble Always the yaddega yaddega from the back seat Wentworth and Flexner s Dictionary of American Slang provides a citation for the similar form yatata yatata yatata from the play Jim Dandy A Fat Man in a Famine 1947 by William Saroyan A different sort of theatrical provenance is offered by an informant with experience in several large cast stage productions In scenes where people in a crowd are supposed to be talking animatedly but unintelligibly to one another she observes the effect is sometimes achieved by having half the cast members say blah blah blah and the other half say yadda yadda yadda The second thing happening is not so much etymological as sociological a continuing evolution in semantic function Terms such as yadda yadda yadda and blah blah blah have a special utility when the speaker s audience can accurately fill in the blanks when the terms act not as synonyms for generic talk but as command keys cued to circumstance that can designate specific information In other words what yadda yadda yadda can convey is something like You and I know all the points that would ordinarily be inserted at this place in the conversation so let s just skip it and move on This usage points to yadda yadda yadda s larger social significance It suggests that an ever larger percentage of the content of everyday communication can be correctly anticipated probably owing in part to the sheer repetition of words and arguments in the various public media I am not aware of any studies comparing the number of words an average person could expect to hear spoken in a typical day 500 years ago vs the number that can be heard now but the increase surely is vast If a politician were to say today that he opposes abortion except when yadda yadda yadda we would all know what he means and we would know what was meant if after an arrest a police officer pulled out a card and just said yadda yadda yadda Adults have always been struck by how much teen age communication can seemingly be accomplished by emitting one of perhaps half a dozen subverbal phonemes and it will be instructive to watch as something along these same lines spreads to the general population As noted lexicographers for obvious reasons have far more trouble gathering oral citations than written ones To aid the larger lexicographical enterprise I m interested in collecting samples of references to yadda yadda yadda or similarly imitative terms in any communications media other than paper Date and explicit provenance must be provided The information will be turned over to experienced professionals It would only be fitting that yadda yadda yadda make it formally into one dictionary before obviating the need for dictionaries at all
