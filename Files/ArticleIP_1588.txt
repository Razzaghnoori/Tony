 The Picture of Sen Dorian Gray When campaign strategists politely invite voters to retire an incumbent they re said to be giving the opponent a gold watch Legacy a spot from Democrat Elliott Close s campaign against 95 year old Sen Strom Thurmond is a 14K example of this technique It cleverly places the still popular politician in a time machine and gives South Carolina voters permission to ease him out of office without repudiating him Juxtaposed with the visual of a young Thurmond is a reminder from the narrator that Thurmond began in politics way back in 1928 As that photo dissolves into one of Thurmond in his 40s then one of him in his 60s 70s the narrator praises the senator for serving South Carolina for most of this century The spot could have reminded voters that Thurmond was a hanging judge for blacks a segregationist candidate for president against Harry Truman and a bitter end opponent of civil rights But avoiding the negative is a smart tack Assailing Thurmond s record would only appear to upbraid voters for having sent him to the Senate a half dozen times As the camera zooms in on the liver spotted Thurmond of the third photo the narrator voices what must be the thoughts of his constituents by now We appreciate all he s done But that s not just a thank you it s a gentle goodbye This is a Dorian Gray brought out of the attic of memory aging before our eyes The next scene clinches the argument It begins with a tight shot of an open book featuring two photos of Thurmond In one he looks as if he s offering a farewell salute in the other he s an old man working out trying to hang on The camera cuts away to reveal that the reader is Close sitting in his own living room Literally closing the book on Thurmond Close says respectfully that this election is about the next century not the last one The succeeding scenes are more conventional but Close s every appearance in vivid color completes the case At what appears to be a Chamber of Commerce lunch he chats with a woman while his voice over offers the assurance that he s for a balanced budget a Thurmond priority without gutting Medicare and student loans This is the only implicit criticism of Thurmond who voted the other way but it is stated in entirely positive terms Next we see Close in a country store pledging again via his voice over that he won t be owned by the special interests The viewer is free to read the clich either as a soft criticism of Thurmond or an affirmation that Close will be like Thurmond unencumbered by liberals and labor Back in his living room Close promises to continue to do the one thing that everyone concedes Thurmond does well I too will provide great constituent service Close is a Democrat and South Carolina has a large black population two things you d never discern from Legacy Race has increasingly become a predictor of party identification in the South and Close can t risk conveying visually or otherwise that he s a liberal or even a Democrat Thurmond has no such worries Thanks to his record he is at liberty to build bridges to blacks without risking white backlash Celebrating the Thurmond legacy and then portraying him as worn out Legacy is free to suggest that a younger version of the senator should replace him These two points are efficiently fused together in the last scene in which Close is surrounded by his very young very contemporary family The narrator gets the last word Elliott Close a new conservative senator for South Carolina
