 The Last Word The book is done How long I ve waited to write these words It was a decade ago this summer that I began my biography of Saul Bellow or rather signed a contract with a publisher declaring my intent to write it Last week I turned in 700 pages of manuscript to my beleaguered copy editor Virginia Avery a kindly white haired woman with a handsome New England face and reserves of patience that run deep From the beginning the issue of duration loomed When my agent asked me how long I thought it would take to write the book he was negotiating the delivery date I answered cheerfully Ten years You can t say that he informed me No one will sign up a book that s going to take that long Why not I trotted out the legendary biographies known to every practitioner of the trade biography lore Leon Edel s 20 year labor on his five volume Henry James How long Leon how long a reviewer in the Times Literary Supplement had importuned after the appearance of the third volume Richard Ellmann s 17 year labor on James Joyce And to say that Nancy Milford s biography of Edna St Vincent Millay is long awaited would be as James himself might have said putting too fine a point on it Milford is already well into her third decade on the project with no end in sight Sally Fitzgerald has been at work on a biography of Flannery O Connor since I was in college and I graduated in 1971 Lewis Dabney signed up to write the biography of Edmund Wilson that I jettisoned in the early 80s and there s no trace of it Some of my best friends are biographers and they ve been in no hurry to deliver Jean Strouse devoted 15 years to J P Morgan and Judith Thurman s Colette is forthcoming this fall after 16 years Edmund Morris finishing his Reagan after a dozen years is considered a model of punctiliousness A decade s nothing Still the general reader may be permitted to wonder Why is biography such a protracted affair Novelists seem able to turn out a book every year or two Historians as burdened by footnotes and data as biographers seldom devote more than five years to a book What s our problem Is it some congenital defect of biographers A laziness or dilatory habit of mind My guess is that our failure of promptitude has to do with the unique relationship we establish with our subjects dead or living Unlike the novelist who invents supposedly his characters or the historian who grapples with a populous cast the biographer enters into a curious intimacy with the person being written about a relationship charged with ambivalence resentment love dependency and all the myriad other emotions that crowd in whenever we allow ourselves to become intimate with another That the biographer doesn t actually live with or in many instances even know his subject that the relationship may be involuntary an unauthorized biography that it s by its very nature unequal one person focusing attention on another with no hope of reciprocity in no way diminishes the intensity of the experience As any biographer will tell you the act of writing a biography is all consuming The abject acknowledgments pages tell the tale To my wife who endured my obsession with grace To my children who grew up hearing about X at the dinner table It s a wonder we don t all end up living alone in boardinghouses In my case the equation was infinitely more complicated than I could have fathomed when I embarked on my biography of Bellow in the summer of 1989 It was in many ways an almost inevitable project for me I am from Chicago Bellow s turf my first biography of Delmore Schwartz had closely paralleled Humboldt s Gift Bellow s novel about Schwartz I was steeped in the Jewish immigrant world he wrote about My subject wary by nature had after a year of elaborate equivocation arrived at the point where he would grant me access to his papers subject to his approval and consent to be interviewed from time to time I didn t want him to authorize the book I wanted my freedom And for his part Bellow maintained that he wasn t finished yet wasn t ready to be summed up a reasonable stand for a robust man in his 74 th year In the end the book was as Bellow took to describing it neither authorized nor unauthorized Over the next decade I made my biographer s rounds like the postman deterred neither by sleet nor snow nor by occasional emanations of reticence or frostiness from my subject from the routine often a fascinating routine of poring over his unpublished manuscripts in the rare book and manuscript division of the University of Chicago Library lugging my laptop all over America in quest of high school classmates cousins friends and lovers of my famously peripatetic subject driving Avis rental cars into the remotest suburbs of Los Angeles and flying into Buffalo N Y in pursuit of letters in private hands Biography is no vocation for old men it requires physical stamina By the time I d filled up my cupboard with the building materials for my book I was to borrow one of Bellow s favorite words bushed Then there was the labor of composition year after year of struggling to assemble these materials into a coherent narrative form without getting bogged down by the facts the downfall of so many of the bloated biographies that now weigh down the shelves of Barnes Noble for their three week window before being shipped back to the publisher By the end of nine years I d written through to the end amassing 1 200 pages of typescript Even my father who might as well have been reading the story of his own life so closely did he identify with Bellow s Chicago origins complained that the book was too long The trouble is that you ve gone through so much pain to collect the damned junior high school transcript or the quote from Bellow s landlord in Paris in 1948 that you feel you have to put it in just to get credit Only after you have a completed manuscript does your confidence build to the point where you can go through the top heavy pile of pages and encountering the third reference to Bellow s occasional book reviews for the New York Times Book Review decide Who cares and slash it with the red pen On my second go round I cut 200 pages dipping below the laminated Page 1 000 I d presented in 1996 to Katy Medina my editor at Random House as evidence of my progress Did she smile or was that a wince On the third pass recalling Proust s admonition to one of his correspondents that if he d only had time he would have written a shorter letter I managed to cut another 200 pages At last it was clear that I had to give up my decadal work in progress My patient publisher was weary of waiting my friends were beginning to taunt me with the prospect that I d never finish I was ready as the self help literature counsels to move on The cover had been designed the catalog copy written I was still revising the copy edited manuscript tearing the whole thing up finding at the last possible moment my voice And how to end it At last I found a way since happily and thanks to Bellow s physical vigor I wouldn t have to write a deathbed scene a conversation he d had with Martin Amis for a BBC documentary on Bellow s life He was ruminating about death and about possibly meeting up again with his parents and his brothers in the next world I thought of ending the book with his quote but then some other stuff happened in his life you ll have to buy the book 24 95 at your local bookstore arriving in April or at least read the reviews to find out what And Bellow too is putting the finishing touches on a novel titled Ravelstein about his late friend Allan Bloom so I had to mention that After turning in the manuscript Thursday I spent the weekend revising the last four chapters and Monday afternoon I wrote the last sentence on the last page His reunion with the dead would have to wait Then I dropped off the last pages at Random House and rushed off to Penn Station to catch the late train to Albany an hour from my farmhouse in the country Depleted and drained I stared out at the Hudson River in the summer dusk drank two miniature bottles of Zinfandel and fell asleep My reunion with the living would have to wait
