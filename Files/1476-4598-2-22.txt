 Background SLC CCL21 normally expressed in high endothelial venules and in T cell zones of spleen and lymph nodes strongly attracts T cells and dendritic cells DC 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 SLC CCL21 recruits both na ve lymphocytes and antigen stimulated DC into T cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs co localizing these early immune response constituents that culminate in cognate T cell activation 1 The capacity to facilitate the co localization of both DC and T cells forms a strong rationale for the use of SLC CCL21 in cancer therapy In previous studies we have shown that the SLC CCL21 mediated anti tumor responses are accompanied by the enhanced elaboration of IFN IP 10 CXCL10 MIG CXCL9 GM CSF and IL 12 but decreased PGE 2 VEGF IL 10 and TGF at the tumor site 9 10 In addition there was a marked increase in CD4 and CD8 cells secreting IFN and GM CSF as well as DC expressing CD11c infiltrating the tumors MIG CXCL 9 and IP 10 CXCL10 are glutamine leucine arginine ELR negative CXC chemokines that are potent chemoattractants for activated T cells 11 12 13 These chemokines also have in common the ability to signal through a G protein coupled receptor CXCR3 expressed on activated T lymphocytes IP 10 CXCL10 MIG CXCL9 and IFN are known to have potent anti tumor activities in vivo 14 15 16 17 Both MIG CXCL9 and IP 10 CXCL10 are important for the anti tumor activity mediated by IFN inducing cytokines such as IL 12 16 18 19 Based on these findings we hypothesized that augmentation in IFN MIG CXCL9 and IP 10 CXCL10 would play an important role in the SLC CCL21 mediated anti tumor response Here we show that the cytokines IFN IP 10 CXCL10 and MIG CXCL9 serve as effector molecules in SLC CCL21 mediated anti tumor responses Results and Discussion Host antigen presenting cells APC are critical for the cross presentation of tumor antigens 20 However tumors have the capacity to limit APC maturation function and infiltration of the tumor site 21 22 23 24 Thus molecules that attract host APC and T cells could serve as potent agents for cancer immunotherapy A potentially effective pathway to restore Ag presentation is the establishment of a chemotactic gradient that favors localization of both activated DC and Type 1 cytokine producing lymphocytes at the tumor site SLC CCL21 a CC chemokine expressed in high endothelial venules and in T cell zones of spleen and lymph nodes strongly attracts naive T cells and DCs 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Because DCs are potent APCs that function as principal activators of T cells the capacity to facilitate the co localization of both DC and T cells may reverse tumor mediated immune suppression and orchestrate effective cell mediated immune responses 9 10 25 26 27 In addition to its immunotherapeutic potential SLC CCL21 has been found to have potent angiostatic effects 28 thus adding further support for its use in cancer therapy Based on these dual capacities we as well as others have begun pre clinical evaluation of SLC CCL21 in several tumor models 9 10 25 26 27 Utilizing two transplantable murine lung cancer models we have previously shown that the anti tumor efficacy of SLC CCL21 is T cell dependent 9 In both models recombinant SLC CCL21 administered intratumorally led to complete tumor eradication in 40 of the treated mice Studies performed in CD4 and CD8 knockout mice also revealed a requirement for both CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes subsets for SLC CCL21 mediated tumor regression Consistent with these findings we found that SLC therapy did not alter tumor growth in SCID mice In immune competent mice intratumoral injection of SLC CCL21 led to a significant increase in CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes as well as DC infiltrating the tumor and the draining lymph nodes The cellular infiltrates were accompanied by an enhanced elaboration of IL 12 IFN IP 10 CXCL10 and MIG CXCL9 at the tumor site 9 SLC CCL21 is documented to have direct anti angiogenic effects 28 29 the tumor reductions observed in this model could have been due to participation by T cells secreting IFN leading to inhibition of angiogenesis via MIG CXCL9 and IP 10 CXCL10 as well as T cell dependent immunity 16 IFN mediates a range of biological effects that facilitate anticancer immunity MIG CXCL9 and IP 10 CXCL10 are potent angiostatic factors that are induced by IFN 14 16 17 Both MIG CXCL9 and IP 10 CXCL10 are chemotactic for stimulated CXCR3 expressing activated T lymphocytes that could further amplify IFN at the tumor site 30 Hence we postulated that in addition to IFN IP 10 CXCL10 and MIG CXCL9 would also be important contributors to the tumor reduction in the context of SLC CCL21 therapy To determine the importance of MIG CXCL9 IP 10 CXCL10 and IFN in the SLC CCL21 mediated antitumor response these cytokines were depleted in SLC CCL21 treated mice Anti IP 10 CXCL10 MIG CXCL9 and IFN antibodies each partially but yet significantly inhibited the anti tumor efficacy of SLC CCL21 Figure 1 p 0 01 compared to the control antibody group Neutralization of IFN caused a significant decrease in both MIG CXCL9 and IP 10 CXCL10 indicating that these chemokines are largely IFN dependent Thus an increase in IFN at the tumor site of SLC CCL21 treated mice could explain the relative increases in IP 10 CXCL10 and MIG CXCL9 The converse was also observed IFN production at the tumor site was found to be MIG CXCL9 and IP 10 CXCL10 dependent as indicated by the fact that neutralization of these cytokines caused a significant decrease in IFN Figure 2 Neutralization of any one of these cytokines caused a concomitant decrease in all three cytokines thus indicating that IFN MIG CXCL9 and IP 10 CXCL10 are interdependent in the SLC CCL21 mediated anti tumor responses Based on these findings we speculated that the decrease of IP 10 CXCL10 and MIG CXCL9 led to a decrease in IFN by limiting the influx of T cells producing IFN at the tumor site Because MIG CXCL9 and IP 10 CXCL10 are chemotactic for stimulated CXCR3 expressing activated T lymphocytes we determined if neutralizing these chemokines in vivo in the SLC CCL21 treated mice would decrease the frequency of CXCR3 expressing T cells at the tumor sites Compared to SLC CCL21 treated mice receiving control antibody flow cytometric evaluation of single cell suspensions of non necrotic tumors from SLC CCL21 treated mice receiving neutralizing antibodies to MIG CXCL9 IP 10 CXCL10 and IFN showed 10 12 and 31 decreases respectively in the gated CD3 CXCR3 veT cell populations Table 1 The fact that neutralization of IFN was the most efficient at decreasing the total number of CXCR3 activated T cells may be due to the decrease in the IFN dependent CXCR3 ligands MIG CXCL9 and IP 10 CXCL10 Individually neutralizing MIG CXCL9 and or IP 10 CXCL10 only led to a partial decrease in the total number of CXCR3 activated T cells Because MIG CXCL9 and IP 10 CXCL10 share the same receptor CXCR3 one possible explanation of a partial decrease in CXCR3 activated T cells is that neutralization of one ligand may overexpose the receptor to the other ligand Furthermore because murine SLC CCL21 binds CXCR3 receptor SLC CCL21 may be recruiting CXCR3 veT cells directly An alternative explanation is that residual cytokines such as IFN inducible T cell chemoattractant ITAC CXCL11 present after in vivo neutralization of IFN MIG IP 10 may have remaining activity and attract CXCR3 veT cells Our results imply that all 3 cytokines IFN MIG and IP 10 play interrelated roles in the recruitment of CXCR3 activated T cells in SLC CCL21 mediated anti tumor responses While the number of CD4 and CD8 cells remained unaltered compared to SLC CCL21 treated mice receiving control antibody mice administered neutralizing antibodies to MIG CXCL9 IP 10 CXCL10 and IFN showed respective decreases of 38 28 and 16 in the number of CD11c DEC205 DC infiltrating the tumor Table 1 At present it is not clear why there is a decrease in DC following neutralization of MIG CXCL9 IP 10 CXCL10 and IFN A plausible explanation is that these cytokines may be involved in complex interactions with other molecules that are chemotactic for DC Further studies are required to delineate the mechanisms responsible for MIG CXCL9 IP 10 CXCL10 and IFN mediated localization of DC at the tumor site Conclusions Our results suggest that the anti tumor properties of SLC CCL21 may be due to its chemotactic capacity in co localization of DC and T cells as well as in part to the induction of key cytokines such as IFN IP 10 CXCL10 and MIG CXCL9
