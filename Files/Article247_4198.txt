 English Class Dear David Don t get me started on the British You know that for the past 45 years until recently we have spent considerable portions of every other year or so in England I was a fellow at St Antony s College in Oxford in 1957 a visiting scholar at the London School of Economics in 1976 77 the year you went to Westminster and the Pitt Professor at Cambridge in 1987 88 one of the happiest years of our life The British can be so deft In 1976 we had a flat on Regent s Park Road facing Primrose Hill and down the street was one of the familiar blue and white plaques that said From 1873 to 1895 here lived Frederick Engels Political Philosopher Not stalwart fighter for the working class Or enemy of the capitalist class Just political philosopher Yet there has also been an ugly strain of anti Semitism that has run through British life associated with the identification of Jews with money Aristocrats have land even penniless not money It is there in Graham Greene s pre WWII novel Stamboul Train with its picture of the greasy currant merchant It is there in T S Eliot s poems Burbank With a Baedeker Bleistein With a Cigar the subject of a disputed book by Anthony Julius just a year ago Mrs Thatcher interestingly enough had at one time four Jews in her cabinet Keith Joseph Malcolm Rifkind etc and her intellectual biographer was our late friend Shirley Letwin So many of these contradictions come to a head in The Spectator the Tory magazine that is full of sparkling writing Yet a number of years ago Auberon Waugh familiarly called Bron as the British are wont to do with public figures the son of Evelyn Waugh had a column in The Spectator in which he remarked We are all familiar with being in strange places and not knowing exactly where we are I woke up one morning and was served a filthy kosher breakfast and I realized that I was in Tel Aviv I wrote a note to Alexander Chancellor who was then the editor and who now writes International Papers for Slate and asked how Waugh knew that it was a filthy kosher breakfast unless it was filth recognizing filth Not the best of repartee but one loses wit in anger And then there is the unspeakable Taki who still writes a weekly column for the Spectator called High Life about the party going and boozing and womanizing in New York London and Gstaad There is often that globule of anti Semitic spit that he drops into his column Yet in his writings for American magazines he is careful to refrain I remarked on this once at a party in London and was overheard by Noel Malcolm who said Do you want him to double his anti Semitism Sir I replied you are too clever by half Repartee You know that I began a book on England many years ago that I never finished What prompted it was the realization that while Marx had lived in England for more than 30 years and that in Capital he told the Germans that England mirrored their fate his writings on English society are so thin Curiously he never tried to meet Mazzini or Alexander Herzen fellow exiles let alone John Stuart Mill or Matthew Arnold He remained within the closed circle of his German devotees While Marx was preoccupied with economic class he never understood English society which has been ruled by social class England has been a fairly rigid class society made visible by accent but with relatively open access for talented grammar school lads such as Allan Bullock or Asa Briggs who become Lords and occupy the major positions in English cultural and educational life Isaiah Berlin first made his mark by conversation Status ruled People bought status by buying land in three generations a gentleman or entering a profession In Trollope s Palliser novels the vade mecum of English society a character says I am not in trade I have a profession Or they renewed the blood and money by American heiresses I don t think that Marx would have liked the novels of Henry James he loved the blood and gore of Eugene Shue And now Tony Blair Blair has finally achieved what Tony Crosland wrote about 40 years ago that Labor could not be a class party after all the working class was shrinking in a post industrial world he has made it a middle class party Blair is a brilliant ruthless politician albeit with an authoritarian streak but vacuous in his rhetoric and ideas His house intellectual Tony Giddens the director of London School of Economics has told him 40 years late that left and right have no meaning today on the ideological spectrum So they have formulated the Third Way What is it No one seems to know My friend W G Lord Runciman the businessman and sociologist at Trinity quite a combination calls it recycled platitudes Les mots justes Is that not the definition of political life today in the United States as well as in the U K Love Dad
