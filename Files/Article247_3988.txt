when Gore was struggling with his decision to enlist or possibly be drafted he ultimately enlisted Gore did not take his cousin up on the offer he says because a lot of those decisions were made with political influence it did not feel right Both George W Bush and Bill Bradley used perfectly legal insider contacts to join the National Guard and Air Force Reserve respectively during the Vietnam War
