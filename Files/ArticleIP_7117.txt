 The Triumph of As Democrats eagerly tout their break even performance in House Senate and gubernatorial races as a grand triumph and as Republicans spin the same numbers into an affirmation of the conservative status quo both sides are overlooking the election s most astonishing results the ballot initiatives Initiatives have made news in recent years by advancing conservative causes limits on gay rights immigration and affirmative action And there were certainly some initiatives to delight the right this year too Voter initiatives approved in Alaska and Hawaii banned gay marriage An initiative in Michigan upheld a ban on assisted suicide Initiatives in the deep South further restricted the rights of prisoners who knew there were any restrictions left to impose An Alaska measure made English the state s official language And a Washington initiative modeled on California s Proposition 209 abolished state affirmative action programs But the overriding theme of the 1998 initiatives is not conservative at all It is that American voters at least in this complacent year are a lot more liberal than Republican pollsters would have you believe Initiatives rewarded both lefty libertarians and paleoliberals On the libertarian front five states Alaska Nevada Oregon Washington and Arizona put medical marijuana on the ballot and five states approved or in Arizona s case re approved it That means the entire Western flank of the nation now permits marijuana as medicine Oregon voters also killed an initiative to re criminalize marijuana possession Initiatives in California and Missouri expanded legalized gambling a libertarian cause increasingly embraced by Democrats And both Colorado and Washington rejected bans on partial birth abortion The Colorado abortion vote is a powerful argument against those who say that initiatives are dangerous because they are too crude and voters are too easily conned At the same time Coloradans refused to ban partial birth abortion they also voted to require parental notification for children seeking abortion The split vote on abortion suggests a subtlety among voters that critics of initiatives rarely acknowledge The initiatives also expressed a surprisingly strong faith in government and a willingness to expand it Voters gave a full throated endorsement to public education Californians approved a 9 billion school bond issue and Rhode Islanders OKed a much smaller one Coloradans rejected a proposal to give tax credits for private school tuition and South Dakotans rebuffed an effort to stop financing schools with property taxes Five states Arizona Maine Michigan New Jersey and North Carolina endorsed ballot initiatives to expand state environmental funding and in all but Arizona by huge margins South Dakotans voted to restrict corporate hog farming as well Only in Oregon where a massively broad ban on logging was proposed did an environmental initiative fail On animal rights too voters cast ballots for more government regulation choosing to ban cockfighting in Arizona animal baiting in Missouri and animal traps and horsemeat sales in California Alaska did reject a ban of wolf traps and Ohioans voted to continue the hunting of mourning doves Washingtonians voted to raise the minimum wage Floridians imposed a new waiting period for gun purchases Arizona and Massachusetts both passed campaign finance reforms allowing public funding of state candidates Nebraska conservative Nebraska turned down an effort to impose mandatory restraints on state spending Iowa gender neutralized its constitution New Hampshire did not and Florida passed an equal rights initiative And in the it may not sound like progress but it is department Utah residents overturned a 102 year old law limiting the property rights of married women and South Carolinians struck the miscegenation ban from the state constitution Democrats afflicted with a foolish optimism may view these initiative victories as a sign of an impending liberal majority I suspect they represent something else the generosity of the prosperous According to exit polls American voters feel happy and rich These votes reflect a generous expansive mood Sick people want to smoke a joint Let em what harm does it do More money for schools Sure Clean water You bet These are not liberal activist votes cast because the initiatives advance a progressive agenda They seem to be smile on the face votes cast because the initiatives are modest and well intentioned and at worst harmless Weather Update On Monday and Tuesday in homage
