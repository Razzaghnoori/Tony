 Private Jet Sex Here s a cute but frightening true fact I just discovered My 9 year old daughter knows the name of Rupert Murdoch s new wife I ll be sure to forbid her from traveling on private planes You are of course completely correct about the chick magnet effect of Lears and Bombardiers and Gulfstreams Private jets undoubtedly get rich men laid for guys inhabiting HerbAllenWorld a Gulfstream is a Vette to the Third Power In fact as you know my novel contains several private jet scenes and a main character specifically imagines his wife fucking her boss on the boss private jet However just to make clear that fiction isn t necessarily autobiographical My own wife when she worked for Viacom once flew across the Atlantic on the corporate jet with the company s chairman and I never entertained any thoughts at all about onboard fornication involving her and Sumner Redstone Dustin Hoffman generated Nora Ephron s ghastliest show business moments Was this on All the President s Men Jeez how perfectly amazingly uncannily apt I thought of Hoffman the other day as I watched The Insider the forthcoming All the President s Men ish movie in which Al Pacino plays a crusading high strung TV news producer By the way in the movie Don Hewitt the producer of 60 Minutes is portrayed as a completely craven asshole I think he ll be unhappier than any of the other real people depicted in the film including the tobacco company P R man John Scanlon who is portrayed merely as evil not unlikable Anyhow watching Pacino I wondered who feels more professional jealousy or competitiveness for the other ethnic hyper acting 1970s superstar from Greenwich Village Hoffman toward Pacino or Pacino toward Hoffman I also thought How astounded we would have been 25 years ago to be told that the All the President s Men ish movie of 1999 would portray CBS News as villainous and the attorney general of Mississippi as a hero No I haven t read Jesse Ventura s book What s frightening about it To me his libertarianism and call a spade a spade plain spokenness seem attractive since moral authoritarianism Gary Bauer Pat Buchanan et al and mealy mouthed temporizing practically every politician except the moral authoritarians Bob Kerrey and Bill Weld are the things that scare and disgust me most in contemporary politics I do confess that every time I actually hear Ventura speak I sort of hate him However if elections are won by Authenticity Balls your version of my Happiness Guyism then Ventura looks like a winner doesn t he And in any case by both our reckonings Al Gore is a sure loser By the way I disobeyed you And Coliseum Books was relieved when my publisher called and suggested we might want to think about rescheduling the reading there on account of Floyd s torrents So when you get back I ll come to your apartment read all the passages about private jets out loud and sign your copy of the book P S You say apropos of the fact Bush seems authentic and ballsy that this is why W is so dangerous I don t quite get this I guess this is why I m not a good Democrat First aren t authenticity and ballsiness good things And dangerous Tell me how a George W Bush administration would be dangerous Yes I d rather have Al Gore picking Supreme Court justices than George Bush and I d rather have Bill Bradley than either of them but Bush doesn t scare me This is conversely among the many reasons I could never be a good Republican I just don t get the anti Clinton apoplexy He s sort of creepy sure but so what Clinton and George W Bush kind of seem like the same guy to me humanly and ideologically fun but slippery guys without much there there
