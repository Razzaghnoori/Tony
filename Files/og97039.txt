Administration the Departments entitled Interim Rules for Health Insurance Portability for Group Health Plans RIN 1545 AV05 1210 AA54 and 0938 AI08 We received the rules on April 9 1997 The rules were published in the Federal Register as interim rules with request for comments on April 8 1997 62 Fed Reg 16894 The interim rules govern access portability and renewability requirements for group health

Security Act of 1974 ERISA and the Public Health Service Act which were enacted by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 HIPAA The group market provisions of HIPAA create concurrent jurisdiction for the Secretaries of Health and Human Services Labor and Treasury and include rules relating to preexisting conditions exclusions special enrollment rights and prohibition of discrimination against individuals based on health statusrelated factors The shared group market provisions in each of the Department s rule except as noted in the preamble are substantially identical Enclosed is our assessment of the Departments compliance with the procedural steps required by section 801 a 1 B i through iv of title 5 with respect to the rules Our review indicates that the Departments complied with the applicable requirements Our Office has recently performed work relating to this area including Health Insurance Portability Reform Could Ensure Continued Coverage for up

TREASURY INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR PENSION AND WELFARE BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES HEALTH CARE FINANCING ADMINISTRATION ENTITLED INTERIM RULES FOR HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY FOR GROUP HEALTH PLANS RIN 1545 AV05 1210 AA54 0938 AI08 i Cost benefit analysis The Departments have prepared a combined economic impact analysis for this interim final rule and the interim final rule issued by the Department of Health and Human Services and published the same day in the Federal Register concerning individual market provisions because the effects of the reforms and burdens imposed overlap the same group of issuers 62 Fed Reg 16908 16920 For group health plans coverage under these rules the Departments cite estimates formulated by the Congressional Budget Office which shows the initial yearly cost direct cost to the private sector to be 50 million with 300 000 people covered and 200 million in subsequent years for limiting the length of preexisting conditions exclusions to 12 months For creditable coverage the CBO estimate is 25 million for the first year and 100 million per year thereafter ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 Since the rules were issued as interim final rules and not as general notices of proposed rulemaking the rules are not subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act However the Departments in the preamble invite comments regarding the impact of the rules on small entities and ways to minimize that impact iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C 1532 1535 Since the rules were issued as interim final rules and not as general notices of proposed rulemaking the rules are not subject to the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 However the Departments point out that the rules have been designed to be the least burdensome alternative for state local and tribal governments Also the Departments met and consulted with representatives of these GAO OGC 97 39 governments including state insurance commissions in drafting the rules to give the states considerable flexibility in complying with HIPAA iv Other relevant information or requirements under acts and executive orders Administrative Procedure Act 5 U S C 551 et seq Section 707 of ERISA Section 9806 of the Internal Revenue code and Section 2707 of the Public Health Service Act provide that the Secretaries may promulgate any interim final rules determined to be appropriate to carry out the provisions of Part B of the act The Secretaries have determined that there is good cause under Section 553 b of the Administrative Procedure Act to not issue a notice of proposed rulemaking because it would be impracticable unnecessary or contrary to the public interest The Secretaries have found that without prompt guidance some members of the regulated community would have difficulty complying with the requirements of the HIPAA and insured individuals will not understand the benefit to them of having a certificate of prior coverage to present upon entering the individual health insurance market However the Departments are accepting comments on the interim final rule for a 90 day period for consideration in the development of the final rules to be issued implementing the HIPAA Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U S C 3501 3520 The interim final rules contain information collections subject to review and approval by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act The Departments have requested emergency review of the collections because the collection of the information is needed before the expiration of the normal time limits of the act to assure guaranteeing availability of individual health insurance coverage to certain individuals with prior group coverage The Departments are requesting that OMB provide a 30 day comment period with OMB approval by June 1 1997 for a 180 day period During the 180 day period the Departments will publish a notice in the Federal Register initiating a 60 day agency review and public comment period with submittal to OMB for review and an extension of the emergency approval to follow The notice contained in the preamble to the interim final rule complies with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act by explaining the need for the information the parties affected and the burden estimates related to the collections by each Department Page 2 GAO OGC 97 39 Statutory authorization for the rule The Department of Labor s interim
