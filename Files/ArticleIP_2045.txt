 Take This Simple Test Here s a three question quiz to determine how rational you are This will work best if you stop and answer each question before going on to the next Imagine that each of your three fabulously wealthy cousins offers you a choice of two Christmas gifts In each case choose the one you d prefer 1 Cousin Snip offers you a choice of A 1 million in cash B A lottery ticket The ticket gives you a 10 percent chance of winning 5 million an 89 percent chance of winning 1 million and a 1 percent chance of winning nothing at all 2 Cousin Snap offers you a choice of A A lottery ticket that gives you an 11 percent chance of winning 1 million B A lottery ticket that gives you a 10 percent chance of winning 5 million 3 Cousin Snurr offers you a choice of A 1 million in cash B A lottery ticket that gives you a 10 11 chance of winning 5 million Now that you ve made your choices you can read on to discover whether you re a rational creature Rational does not mean risk neutral A risk neutral person is one who is indifferent when given a choice between 50 cents and a 50 50 chance of 1 A risk neutral person would choose B in all three cases In Snip s offer 10 percent of 5 million 500 000 plus 89 percent of 1 million 890 000 equals 1 39 million which trumps 1 million In Snap s offer 10 percent of 5 million 500 000 trumps 11 percent of 1 million 110 000 In Snurr s offer 10 11 of 5 million is 4 55 million which trumps 1 million But it s equally rational to avoid risk or to seek it out The insurance and gambling industries are based on these proclivities Even so rationality does imply some logical consistency in your choices about risk It would be embarrassing if a lot of Slate readers failed this test so I m going to make it easy by adopting a very broad definition of rationality As long as you satisfy two simple criteria I m willing to call you rational Here s my first criterion If you prefer A to B then you should prefer a chance of winning A to an equally large chance of winning B And here s the test to see whether you ve met that criterion Your answers to Questions 2 and 3 should be the same That s because Snap s choice A is an 11 percent shot at a million bucks and Snurr s choice A is a million bucks Therefore Snap s A is an 11 percent shot at Snurr s A Meanwhile Snap s choice B amounts to an 11 percent shot at Snurr s choice B Do the math A 10 percent chance of winning 5 million is the same as an 11 percent chance of winning a 10 11 chance of winning 5 million 0 11 x 10 11 0 10 So if you prefer Snurr s A to Snurr s B you should prefer Snap s A to Snap s B Here s my second criterion of rationality If you re choosing between two lotteries with identical chances to win then your preference should be unaffected if I throw in a consolation prize that you get if you lose in either case You pass that test if your answers to Questions 1 and 3 are the same This is why Snip s choice A is 1 million Another way to say 1 million weird but bear with me is an 11 percent chance to win 1 million with a consolation prize of 1 million for losing Snurr s choice A is also 1 million So Snip s A is an 11 percent shot at Snurr s A with a 1 million consolation prize Snip s choice B is a 10 percent chance of winning 5 million plus a 1 percent chance of winning nothing plus an 89 percent chance of winning 1 million The first two items taken together amount to an 11 percent chance of a 10 11 chance of winning 5 million The third item means you get 1 million if that 11 percent chance doesn t come through Snurr s choice B is a 10 11 chance to win 5 million Snip s choice B is therefore an 11 percent shot at Snurr s choice B with a 1 million consolation prize So if you prefer Snip s A to Snip s B you should prefer Snurr s A to Snurr s B if you re rational To sum up if you are even minimally rational your answers to Questions 1 2 and 3 should all be the same But they probably aren t According to survey data collected by Nobel laureate Maurice Allais and duplicated by several subsequent researchers most people answer A to Question 1 and B to Question 2 There is no way to reconcile that combination of answers with the most rudimentary theory of rationality no matter how you answer Question 3 In other words people prefer the cash over the lottery ticket to an extent that rational risk aversion can t explain Economists have variously viewed the Allais Paradox as a warning a trifle an opportunity and a challenge If you re looking to explain all human behavior on the basis of a few simple axioms it s a warning If you don t believe that casual answers to abstract survey questions constitute an important part of human behavior it s a trifle If the survey responses mean that people are less rational than they ought to be it s an opportunity for economists to teach better decision making skills If you conclude that there s a critical element missing from our theory of rationality it s a challenge to identify that element One missing element is regret When you choose a lottery instead of a sure thing as in Question 1 you risk not just losing the lottery but also feeling regretful about your recklessness But when you choose between two lotteries as in Question 2 you can always reconcile yourself to a loss by thinking Well I d probably have lost no matter what I chose Maybe that s why most people go for the sure thing in Question 1 but are willing to go for the slightly riskier of the two bets in Question 2 Click for an experiment that could test this hypothesis Here s another thought experiment that indicates the importance of avoiding regret Suppose you belong to a company of 10 soldiers of whom one must be chosen for the distasteful task of executing a prisoner Which of the following do you prefer A One soldier is selected at random to shoot the prisoner Or B all 10 soldiers fire at once without knowing which one of the 10 has been issued live ammunition Either way you d have a 10 percent chance of being the executioner so simple theories of rationality suggest that you should be indifferent when asked to choose between the two options Yet most people prefer B because in case B you never know whether you ve been unlucky The analogy between the soldiers and the Allais survey respondents is imperfect the soldiers who choose method B are trying to avoid regret over bad luck while the survey respondents are perhaps trying to avoid regret over bad decisions But in either case ignoring the human impulse toward regret avoidance might give a social scientist cause
