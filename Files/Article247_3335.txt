 Our Race Can Kick Your Race s Ass Walter I m sorry you find so little promise or fascination in the nascent New York Senate race yesterday you said the same about Al Gore and George W Bush Who does interest you I disagree Giuliani s a far more complex and appealing guy than your caricature indicates And I guess we don t know the same liberal Democrats because mine are completely fired up about Hillary s run So please refrain from inviting Norman Mailer Jesse Ventura Jerry Springer or anyone else into our race Back to the papers Yesterday you remarked on Peter Appelbome s warmly honest obituary for Willie Morris and today I want to mention R W Apple s lovely goodbye to the cookbook writer Richard Olney I never thought an obituary could make me hungry But this one does by describing Olney s favorite dishes most memorable meals and culinary heirs The accompanying photo is just as striking and informal It depicts Olney dishcloth tucked into the waistband of his jeans shelling peas in his Provence kitchen In contrast the Deaths column that is the brief announcements placed by the family and friends of the less famous deceased is depressingly uniform and impersonal These announcements aren t printed in the national edition of the Times But every newspaper except the one you write for has its own space for local deaths Today s all read the same way Surname first name Cherished husband of wife Deeply saddened heartfelt sympathies sincerest condolences None mention a single personal characteristic of the deceased I wonder how the Times would have reacted if Olney s family had submitted an announcement as personal as his obituary Olney Richard Adored teacher of Alice Waters Lived next to a grape arbor Devoted lover of garlicky chicken and supple mashed potatoes Survived by his 35 books on food and wine Do you think they would have taken it Write soon Jodi
