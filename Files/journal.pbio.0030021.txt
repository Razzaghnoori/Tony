 Evolutionary developmental biology is motivated by the premise that the differences we see between species are caused by changes that have occurred in the genes that regulate their developmental programs Beginning in the 1980s general principles began to emerge about the evolution of development in animals The identification of the Hox genes in Drosophila melanogaster and the subsequent discovery of their conservation and similar expression in different Metazoans led to the revolutionary realization that many of the mechanisms critical to basic animal development have been conserved across more than 500 million years of evolution Many other developmental pathways such as those specifying the heart and the central nervous system have since been elucidated and promptly subjected to successful comparative analysis These celebrated discoveries illustrate ways that very different organisms are at a fundamental level similar to one another But not all developmental processes are so conservative an outstanding example is sex determination The majority of animal species produce two sexes and current phylogenies e g 1 suggest that sexual dimorphism was likely a feature of the last common ancestor of the coelomate bilaterians a vast clade of animals that excludes only sponges ctenophores cnidarians and acoel flatworms However though critical for development and reproduction the mechanisms that specify sex determination are among the least conserved known Marked variation exists in both the primary sex determination signal and in the downstream genetic pathways that interpret the signal We are thus presented with our first conundrum sexual differentiation appears to be an ancient and potentially homologous feature of animal biology yet its genetic specification suggests multiple origins Bewildering Variety The variety of primary sex determination cues was appreciated long before the advent of molecular genetics 2 The two broadest categories are genetic sex determination GSD in which the sex of offspring is set by a sex chromosome or an autosomal gene and environmental sex determination ESD in which sex is determined by temperature as with turtles local sex ratio as with some tropical fish or population density as with mermithid nematodes Though little is known about the molecular mechanisms of ESD within the GSD systems many different mechanisms have been uncovered Dual sex chromosome systems in which either the female ZW ZZ or the male XX XY is heterogametic are common as are systems set by the ratio of the number of X chromosomes to sets of autosomes X A There are also systems in which heterozygosity at a single locus is required for female development known as complementary sex determination 3 as well as systems involving sex determination via multiple genes with additive effects Molecular genetic investigations of GSD in model systems such as Drosophila Caenorhabditis and mice have revealed a clear lack of conservation underscoring the diversity For example although the primary sex determination signal in both D melanogaster and C elegans is the X A ratio the fruit fly pathway consists of a cell autonomous cascade of regulated mRNA splicing while that of the nematode follows a Hedgehog like intercellular signaling pathway 4 GSD in mammals depends with some interesting exceptions see 5 upon a Y specific dominant gene Sry encoding a transcription factor In the face of such impressive differences perhaps we should question our assumption of homology could it be that sex determination in different taxa has arisen independently over and over again in evolution Until 1998 this seemed like a good bet The discovery of the homology of the key sex determining genes doublesex in Drosophila and mab 3 in C elegans provided the first evidence for a common evolutionary basis of sex determination in animals 6 Soon related doublesex mab 3 DM family genes with roles in male sexual development were discovered in vertebrates and even cnidarians 7 8 Here at last was a smoking gun that could link the diverse metazoan sex determination systems Figure 1 But as satisfying as the result was it immediately gave birth to another mystery if the enormous diversity of sex determination systems are all derived from a common ancestor how could they possibly have been modified so radically After all sexual differentiation and reproduction are hardly unimportant developmental processes Focusing on Close Relatives To understand how such diversity came to be we need to look at the differences between closely related species This approach allows the discovery and interpretation of small scale sex determination changes before they are obscured by subsequent changes The processes discovered in this way might then be reasonably extrapolated to explain the seemingly unrelated systems of more deeply diverged taxa Work in dipterans 9 and nematodes 10 has revealed three evolutionary phenomena that characterize shorter term sex determination evolution The first of these is the often astounding rate of molecular evolution at the level of nucleotide and aminoacid sequences Although some sex determining genes are well conserved many show unprecedented substitution rates 11 An extreme example is the central integrator of the X A ratio in Caenorhabditis xol 1 The xol 1 orthologues of the closely related nematodes C elegans and C briggsae are a mere 22 identical 12 even though genes surrounding xol 1 are much better conserved Figure 2A Remarkably the 3 neighbor of xol 1 the immunoglobulin dim 1 is only 5 kb away and is essentially identical between species A second phenomenon best exemplified by dipteran insects is the modification of genetic control pathways through the gain or loss of key pathway components Figure 2B In Drosophila the first gene to respond to the X A ratio is Sxl whose transcription is regulated by both autosomal and X linked factors very early in development 4 13 When X A 1 i e in female embryos Sxl transcription occurs and produces Sxl protein Later in development transcription from a second promoter occurs in both sexes but these transcripts cannot be productively spliced without the earlier burst of Sxl expression As a result only females sustain Sxl expression and in turn only females can productively splice the mRNA of tra its downstream target Productive splicing of tra is required to produce the female specific form of dsx a founding member of the DM family mentioned above In a series of groundbreaking papers Saccone and colleagues investigated the pathway in the more distantly related heterogametic Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata The first surprise was that although a highly conserved Sxl homologue exists in Ceratitis it does not undergo sex specific regulation similar to that of Drosophila which suggests that it does not play a key switch role Saccone et al 1998 Similar results have also been found for the housefly Musca domestica 14 indicating that the role of Sxl in sex determination may be restricted to Drosophila and its closest relatives In contrast tra and dsx are key sex regulators in all dipterans examined thus far A further surprise came when the Ceratitis tra homologue was characterized 15 In the case of this gene clear evidence for sex specific regulation was found and as with Drosophila only females productively splice tra mRNA However this splicing difference can be explained nicely by a positive feedback similar to that seen in Drosophila Sxl in which Tra protein regulates its own splicing In 2002 Pane et al proposed that the dominant male specifying M factor on the Y chromosome inhibits this autoregulation 15 As a result males cannot make functional Tra protein and the male form of Dsx is produced These experiments show not only how a pathway can evolve but also importantly how X A and heterogametic GSD systems can be interconverted by modifying the cue that regulates a conserved molecular switch gene the splicing of tra mRNA A detailed scenario for how this might occur has recently been proposed 16 Finally recent studies of Caenorhabditis nematodes have shed light on the genetic basis of the convergent evolution of sex determination related to mating system adaptations An important factor in this area are new phylogenies of the genus 17 18 which consistently suggest the surprising possibility that the closely related hermaphroditic species C elegans and C briggsae acquired self fertilization independently from distinct gonochoristic male female ancestors Figure 2C Although this scenario is somewhat uncertain purely on parsimony grounds recent work on the genetic control of the germline bisexuality that defines hermaphroditism has tipped the balance toward parallel evolution Working with C elegans Clifford et al 19 cloned fog 2 a gene required for spermatogenesis in hermaphrodites but not in males Upon doing so it became clear that fog 2 is part of a large family of F box genes and was produced by several recent rounds of gene duplication The C briggsae genome sequence suggested that while C briggsae possesses a similarly large family of F box proteins the duplication event giving rise to fog 2 was specific to the C elegans lineage In this issue of PLoS Biology Nayak et al 20 extend this work by rigorously demonstrating that fog 2 is indeed absent in C briggsae The authors also identify a short C terminal domain that makes FOG 2 uniquely able to perform its germline sex determining function This domain is probably derived from a frame shifting mutation in an ancestral gene Working with C briggsae Stothard et al 21 Haag et al 22 and Hill et al unpublished data have also found evidence of important species specific regulation of germline sex determination RNA interference and gene knockout approaches have shown that while C elegans requires the male promoting genes fem 2 and fem 3 to produce sperm in hermaphrodites C briggsae requires neither Given that both genes have conserved roles in male somatic sex determination this suggests that C briggsae evolved hermaphroditism in a way that bypasses these genes The long standing mystery of sex determination and its diversity began by comparisons between distantly related species Recent work on closer relatives has uncovered processes that through a reasonable extrapolation enable the connection of these disparate dots into a fascinating picture of developmental evolution Though the divergence is extreme it is likely that a better understanding of the evolution of sex determination genes and pathways holds lessons about the evolution of development in general The next major challenge will be to integrate the comparative developmental data with the ecological and population processes that are driving the evolution of sex determination Only then will we be able to say that the picture is complete
