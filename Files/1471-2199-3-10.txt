 Background Follicle stimulating hormone FSH regulates spermatogenesis through the somatic Sertoli cells of the testis 1 Sertoli cells act as nursing cells and supplies germ cells with energy and controls the biochemical environment in which they develop 2 Among the FSH regulated functions are increased glucose uptake and oxidation In response to glucose transcription of several glycolytic and lipogenic genes are activated through the glucose carbohydrate insulin response element GIRE ChoRE or IRE 3 4 Upstream stimulatory factors USF 1 and 2 are characterized by a basic helix loop helix leucine zipper domain responsible for dimerization and DNA binding and are major components of the GIRE complex 5 6 7 8 The main USF isoforms USF1 43 kDa and USF2 44 kDa are ubiquitously expressed and encoded by separate genes 9 10 11 In addition more isoforms of USF2 are produced due to alternative splicing and utilization of different translation start sites 12 13 USF factors exist as homo and heterodimers and the heterodimer of USF1 USF2a seems to dominate although there are cell type specific variations 12 USF1 and USF2 show different transactivating potential and USF2 appears to be the functional transactivator of the GIRE complex although both USF1 and USF2 are important for sustained dietary induced expression of the fatty acid synthase gene in liver 14 USF isoforms are important for expression of several genes involved in Sertoli cell growth and differentiation Among genes that are stimulated by FSH cAMP during the period of maturation of Sertoli cells 15 to 20 days of age in rats are several subunits of cAMP dependent protein kinase PKA the serine threonine kinase mainly responsible for the downstream effects of FSH 15 Expression of the RII regulatory subunit of cAMP dependent protein kinase is highly induced 50 fold at the mRNA level in primary cultures of rat Sertoli cells as a late response to cAMP peaking at 12 hours 16 We have demonstrated that expression of CAAT Enhancer binding protein C EBP is induced by cAMP with rapid kinetics in Sertoli cells and that C EBP is responsible for induction of late response genes like the RII gene 17 The RII promoter contains a conserved E box HLH element in the basal promoter localized at 280 to 275 relative to the functional ATG 18 This element is shown to be important for cAMP responsiveness in granulosa cells and it has been shown to bind both USF and Myc in CHO and NB2a cells 18 19 In this work we show that USF isoforms may regulate cAMP responsiveness of the RII promoter by modulating the effect of C EBP and that the formation of USF isoforms may be regulated by cAMP in Sertoli cells Results USF complexes are formed on the RII promoter A specific complex that formed a Dnase I footprint 306 to 265 in the cAMP responsive region of the RII promoter in granulosa cells 18 covers a consensus E box CACGTG known to bind helix loop helix bHLH transcription factors Electrophoretic mobility shift assay EMSA with extracts from Sertoli cells demonstrated specific binding to the conserved element using the footprinted region as probe 20 When incubated with proteins from Sertoli cell nuclear extracts at least five complexes were formed Fig 1 complex I to V We found that USF2 antibody shifted complex I and III Fig 1lanes 3 and 4 whereas complex II and IV were completely shifted with USF1 antibody suggesting that the USF complexes contained homodimers Complex V was not shifted by antibodies directed against N terminal parts of USF1 or USF2 but with antibodies directed against the C terminal DNA binding region of USF2 Fig 1lane 3 Thus this complex contained truncated USF2 A small shift in mobility of this complex was observed in extracts prepared from Sertoli cells treated with 8 CPT cAMP for 6 h data not shown Experiments using various protease inhibitors indicated that the changes in complex mobility were due to inhibitory effects of PKA on the protease calpain The truncated USF complexes forming complexes III to IV were abolished in the presence of calpain inhibitor I ALLN unpublished results A 31 kDa USF1 isoform is induced by cAMP In order to study the existence of different variants of USF expressed under stimulated and basal conditions we performed immunoblotting experiments with antibodies against C terminal regions of USF1 and USF2 For USF1 we observed that a new immunoreactive protein of about 31 kDa was formed only in nuclear extracts from cAMP stimulated Sertoli cells Fig 2A This isoform was not soluble but associated with a 1 Triton extractable fraction not shown In contrast we found no significant changes in USF2 protein levels or mobility following stimulation by cAMP Fig 2B Other truncated USF1 or USF2 isoforms could not be detected in this assay which may indicate that the levels of isoforms forming complex V Fig 1 are very low relative to the full length protein We were not able to relate the appearance of the novel 31 kDa USF1 isoform to changes in USF complex formation in EMSA Formation of the truncated USF1 isoform in cAMP treated cells was not affected by addition of calpain inhibitor unpublished results USF2 inhibits cAMP mediated induction of the RII promoter We investigated the function of USF isoforms in regulation of the RII promoter using a CAT reporter containing the basal RII promoter including the consensus E box Fig 3A and expression vectors for USF1 USF2a and USF2b isoforms We found that none of the USF isoforms affected basal transcription from the RII promoter not shown whereas both splice variants of USF2 a and b reduced cAMP stimulated levels of reporter expression to 25 USF1 however had no inhibitory effect on the cAMP mediated induction of RII Fig 3Bshows a dose dependent reduction of cAMP responsiveness with increasing amounts of USF2a expression vector with a 50 reduction in reporter activity at 75 ng of USF2a vector and a 75 inhibition at 750 ng of USF2a vector USF2 inhibits C EBP mediated induction of the RII promoter We have previously reported that some of the late induction of RII by cAMP depends on the rapid cAMP mediated increase in C EBP expression 17 To test the effect of different USF isoforms on C EBP mediated induction of the RII promoter we transfected combinations of the transcription factors Fig 4 As previously reported the full length LAP form of C EBP induced the RII promoter 5 6 fold whereas the C EBP LIP form lacking the transactivating region had no effect Co transfecting USF1 had no significant effect on C EBP mediated induction but USF2a 1 1 USF2a C EBP expression vectors reduced induction by 60 indicating that USF2a may interrupt the ability of C EBP to transactivate the RII promoter Discussion The promoters of several genes induced by FSH in Sertoli cells and granulosa cells including c Fos transferrin follicle stimulating hormone receptor SF 1 genes and the RII gene contain functional E box elements 21 22 23 24 We found that several USF complexes containing full length USF1 and USF2 as well as truncated versions are formed at the consensus E box HLH binding element in the RII promoter in Sertoli cell nuclear extracts USF1 and USF2 display identical dimerization and DNA binding domains but the transactivating regions differ 25 USF1 and USF2 obviously serve different yet overlapping functions and regulating the relative USF1 USF2 levels may be decisive for the pattern of USF mediated gene expression which has been shown in studies of USF knockout mice The USF2 mouse has obvious growth defects and reduced fertility 25 whereas the USF1 deficient mice are viable and fertile with minor behavioural disturbances A severe delay in glucose mediated regulation of the GIRE containing fatty acid synthase FAS gene is found in both USF deficient mice although insulin response was unaltered indicating that the USF1 USF2 heterodimer is implicated in FAS expression 14 We have previously shown that C EBP functions as a secondary effector of cAMP signaling on slow response genes in Sertoli cells including RII 17 Both C EBP and the RII E box is shown be involved in cAMP responsiveness of the RII gene 17 18 Our present results indicate that USF2 disturbs this C EBP mediated transactivation of RII No consensus C EBP binding site is found in the promoter construct responsive to cAMP and C EBP but a possibility exists that C EBP attach to the RII promoter through protein protein interactions with USF1 or other members of the transcriptional unit formed at the E box C EBP is previously reported to be an important accessory factor for transactivation by several other transcription factors 26 C EBP was shown to transactivate the 1 acid glycoprotein gene promoter even when mutated in the DNA binding domain and this activation appeared to depend on protein protein interaction with glucocorticoid receptor through the leucine zipper region 27 Recently a conserved domain in C EBP and C EBP was shown to mediate cAMP responsiveness strengthening the fact that C EBP may be characterized as a cAMP responsive nuclear regulator 28 29 On the COX 2 promoter in granulosa cells cAMP mediated regulation was shown to be mediated primarily by an E box that bind USF1 and USF2 isoforms in a manner resembling the RII E box in Sertoli cells 30 Transactivation of the COX 2 gene in skin carcinoma cells is highly dependent on this E box together with a C EBP binding site that bind C EBP and C EBP 31 These data strengthens a model of formation of a cAMP responsive unit CRU containing USF and C EBP We propose a model of interaction between USF and C EBP by which USF2 inhibits the cAMP responsiveness of C EBP either through interacting with the domain mediating the cAMP responsiveness or by competing with USF1 The cAMP regulated formation of a 31 kDa USF1 isoform may also play a role in formation of the RII CRU This truncated USF1 isoform may result from proteolytic cleavage or may be a novel splice variant In granulosa cells it has previously been shown that the level of N terminally truncated USF2 is regulated by cAMP Binding of truncated USF2 to a HLH element in the prostaglandin G H synthase 2 PGHS 2 promoter was abolished in extracts from cells stimulated by human chorionic gonadotrophin hCG which signals through cAMP 32 Other reports have suggested a role for USF in inhibition of transcriptional activation mediated by other transcription factors An inhibitory effect of USF on Myc mediated cellular proliferation has been demonstrated in HeLa cells 33 and a non canonical HLH element inhibits expression of the fibroblast growth factor binding protein FGF BP in several carcinoma cells 34 Furthermore USF2 inhibits binding of hypoxia inducible factor 1 HIF 1 to the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 PAI 1 gene in hepatocytes in order to disturb transcriptional activation 35 Our results add C EBP mediated activation of RII to the mechanisms inhibited by USF An opposite role of USF and C EBP could also be explained by the counteracting effects these transcription factors have on glucose metabolism Whereas USF induces expression of enzymes involved in glycolysis C EBP regulates gluconeogenesis mainly by activating phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase PEPCK 36 37 It has recently been reported that USF is implicated in transcriptional activation of the 1a promoter of the RI gene in skeletal muscle cells 38 Regulating the relative levels of RI versus RII is physiologically important eg in lipid metabolism 39 40 and a possible function of USF in tuning RI RII ratio by activating RI transcription and inhibiting RII transcription is an interesting target of further investigation Conclusions 1 USF1 and USF2 as well as truncated USF isoforms bind to a consensus E box in the RII promoter in Sertoli cells 2 Cyclic AMP induces expression of a novel 31 kDa USF1 isoform 3 Overexpression of USF2 but not USF1 inhibits cAMP mediated and C EBP mediated
