 Introduction A characteristic feature of many cancer types is their ability to metastasise to the skeleton At the skeletal site of metastatic invasion the bone metabolism is dysregulated and bone resorption or bone formation or both is upregulated Bone is the most common target site of metastatic invasion in breast cancer 1 This is of clinical importance as metastatic bone disease is associated with increased morbidity and excess mortality 2 To initiate successful preventive therapy it is thus imperative that the bone metastases are detected early 3 The diagnosis of bone metastases is usually performed through bone scintigraphy However this technique is invasive and is not sensitive enough for detection of the very early stages of metastasis 4 Biochemical markers of bone turnover are noninvasive and may potentially provide a more sensitive measure of metastatic skeletal invasion but clinical applications of the bone turnover markers have not been thoroughly evaluated for such a clinical role Degradation products derived from the 1 chain of type I collagen CTX have been shown to provide a sensitive and specific index of bone resorption 5 6 Preliminary studies have suggested that the CTX marker may be applicable for monitoring skeletal metastases in breast and prostate cancer patients 7 8 The epitope recognised in the CTX assays comprises the six residues AHDGGR 1209 1214of the collagen type I C terminal telopeptide The aspartyl glycine site DG within this epitope is susceptible to spontaneous nonenzymatic rearrangement as outlined in Fig 1 CTX fragments derived from newly synthesised collagen are of the native peptide form L aspartyl peptide L where the aspartic acid residue D 1211 is on the L enantiomeric form and is linked to the glycine residue G 1212 through a peptide bond Collagen and CTX fragments will rearrange with age to three age modified forms the isomerised form L isoaspartyl peptide L where the bond between the aspartic acid and glycine residue goes through the carboxyl group of the aspartyl residue the racemised form D aspartyl peptide D where the aspartic acid D 1211 is on a D enantiomeric form and the isomerised and racemised form D isoaspartyl peptide D 9 The relative accumulation of the three age modified forms is dependent on the balance between anabolic and catabolic processes in bone and pathologic situations affecting these processes may thus also affect the relative amounts of the four CTX forms 9 10 11 It has been shown that in Paget s disease of bone a condition characterised by a localised upregulation of bone turnover there is a significant increase in the ratio between the native peptide form of CTX L and the age modified forms L D isoaspartyl peptide and D 9 The use of CTX ratios may thus be indicative of the significant decrease in the residence time and therefore the average age of the resorbed bone collagen type I fragments in Pagetic patients 9 This indicates that perturbations in the normally well regulated process of bone turnover can result in changes in the half life of collagen type I within the bone matrix This in turn will result in increased amounts of the newly synthesised LCTX form in the circulating pool of CTX fragments that is reflected in the elevated ratios 9 10 11 Metastatic bone cancer will also affect the balance between the anabolic and catabolic processes at the local site of invasion The measurement of CTX isoforms and the ratios between the native Lform and the age modified forms of CTX indicative of the age of the resorbed collagen fragments may thus provide clinical useful information for diagnosing and monitoring bone metastasis occurrence in cancer patients 11 Such an application of the CTX bone resorption markers may be especially relevant for breast cancer patients who have a high risk of developing bone metastases In the present study our aim was to assess the clinical utility of the different CTX isoforms as well as the ratios between the isoforms to detect breast cancer induced bone metastases For this purpose the urinary CTX isoforms L L and Dwere quantified by immunoassay in healthy premenopausal and postmenopausal women and in women affected with breast cancer either with or without bone metastases Patients and methods Study population Urine samples were collected as the morning void from 24 healthy premenopausal women age mean standard deviation SD 33 9 5 6 years and 31 healthy postmenopausal women age 55 1 2 7 years In addition 123 female patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer participated in the study Eight patients were hypercalcemic serum calcium 2 7 mmol l albumin corrected had radiologically confirmed bone metastases and were 54 4 12 0 years of age HC patients One hundred patients were normocalcemic serum calcium between 2 0 and 2 7 mmol l albumin corrected had radiologically confirmed bone metastases and were 54 4 12 0 years of age NC patients Finally 15 breast cancer patients 54 5 12 3 years of age were normocalcemic had early stage nonmetastatic cancer but were without radiological signs of bone metastases NC patients Fifty per cent 49 and 53 of subjects were premenopausal in the HC NC and NC patient groups respectively There was no statistical difference between the proportions of premenopausal women in the three groups The presence or absence of bone metastasis in patients was determined by bone scintigraphy and was confirmed by conventional radiography X ray as necessary All study subjects had serum creatinine 265 mol l and received endocrine therapy and or an anthracycline containing regimen Some patients had additional radiotherapy in the event of clinical symptoms e g bone pain instability The use of antineoplastic hormonal treatment 20 mg tamoxifen 500 mg aminoglutethimide 500 mg provera was allowed but none of the patients were receiving bisphosphonate therapy prior to entry into the study Informed written consent was obtained from all participants according to the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 as revised in 1983 The study was approved by the local human investigations committee Measurement of CTX isoforms by immunoassay analysis The CrossLaps radioimmunoassay 12 and the Cross Laps ELISA 13 are commercially available immunoassays specific for the native L and isomerised L forms of CTX respectively The assays were performed as recommended by the manufacturer Nordic Bioscience Diagnostics Herlev Denmark The D CTX ELISA is a competitive assay based on polyclonal rabbit antibodies for the Dform of CTX The assay has been described elsewhere 9 All determinations of urinary CTX were corrected for creatinine The three CTX assays were calibrated using synthetic CTX standards the concentration of which had been determined by analysis of the total amino acid composition as described previously 14 Statistical analysis Biochemical data were compared between groups using the Mann Whitney U test two tailed For all tests P 0 05 was considered significant The discriminatory power of the different CTX isoforms or CTX ratios in distinguishing groups from controls was assessed using T or Z scores i e number of SDs from the mean of the controls Results The urinary excretion of all CTX forms was significantly higher P 0 001 in the postmenopausal group when compared with the premenopausal women with approximately 2 5 fold higher levels Table 1 When ratios between the newly synthesised Lform and the age modified forms Land D were calculated only minor and nonsignificant differences were observed between premenopausal and postmenopausal women In patients with breast cancer induced bone metastases the urinary excretion of the newly synthesised LCTX form was more increased than the age modified forms Land D Compared with NC patients the HC patients had a 3 4 fold elevation in LCTX and the NC patients had 2 2 fold higher levels of LCTX P 0 01 The levels of DCTX representing the oldest form of CTX were increased 2 4 fold and 1 7 fold in HC patients and in NC patients compared with NC patients Fig 2 The ratio between the nonisomerised Lform and the racemised Dform of CTX was consequently increased in NC patients and in HC patients 2 2 and 1 5 times respectively when compared with NC patients and increased 2 4 and 1 6 times respectively compared with postmenopausal patients However these increases in the L Dratio did not reach statistical significance as evaluated by nonparametric statistics The ability of the various CTX forms and CTX ratios to discriminate between patients with bone metastases HC patients and NC patients and patients without bone metastases NC patients was assessed by Z score analysis using the mean and SD of the NC patient group Fig 3 This analysis revealed that the LCTX levels provided the best differentiation between patients with metastases HC patients and NC patients and nonmetastasised controls Fig 3 Although the L Dratio displayed the highest mean Z score the urinary excretion of the LCTX form still appeared to have the best ability to identify patients affected by bone metastases Thus 58 of patients affected by bone metastases had significantly increased LCTX values Z score 2 compared with breast cancer patients without bone metastases NC patients Fig 3 In comparison 30 of patients affected by bone metastases had L Dratios more than 2 SDs above the normal postmenopausal mean Fig 3 In addition whereas only 27 of patients affected by bone metastases had LCTX values below the mean of nonmetastasised controls NC patients 52 of these patients had L Dratios below this value Fig 3 Discussion In the present study the clinical utility of assays for the various CTX forms in the assessment of breast cancer induced bone metastases was investigated The urinary concentration of all four CTX isoforms was initially measured in reference populations of healthy premenopausal and postmenopausal women The levels of the three CTX isoforms L Land Dwere 2 3 fold to 2 7 fold higher in the postmenopausal women Table 1 in accordance with previous reports of CTX levels during the menopause 15 As all forms were elevated to the same magnitude in postmenopause the ratios between the newly synthesised LCTX form and the older Land DCTX forms was not significantly different in premenopausal and postmenopausal women This indicates that the average age and thus the half life of bone collagen is similar in premenopausal and postmenopausal women In a study comprising larger cohorts a small but significant elevation in the L Lratio was found indicating that the net half life of collagen is slightly decreased after the menopause 16 In breast cancer patients affected by bone metastases HC patients and NC patients the levels of all CTX isoforms were elevated compared with healthy postmenopausal controls or with NC patients The Lform representing the degradation of newly formed bone was however more elevated than the corresponding age related isoforms Table 1 HC patients had a 3 4 fold elevation in LCTX levels and a 2 2 fold elevation was seen in NC patients indicating that the more severe condition in the HC patients is reflected by the LCTX marker The least prominent elevation was seen for the DCTX levels The L DCTX ratio reflecting the relative contents of age modified CTX forms was highly increased in HC patients 1 5 fold and 1 6 fold compared with NC patients and with postmenopausal patients respectively and in NC patients 2 2 fold and 2 4 fold compared with NC patients and with postmenopausal patients This suggests that the age and thus the half life of collagen type I fragments generated by resorption is decreased in the group of patients with bone metastases Such a decrease in collagen type I half life is likely to reflect a significant imbalance between anabolic and catabolic processes at the focal area of metastatic invasion 11 A similar imbalance is seen in some high turnover conditions including Paget s disease 9 17 In situations of high bone turnover the aged bone matrix will rapidly be replaced with a new matrix leading to a lower residence time i e half life of bone collagen More young bone as reflected by the LCTX levels will be resorbed and the relative content of age modified forms will decrease The relative content of LCTX is reflected in the CTX ratios providing an index of bone collagen half life 9 Among the CTX ratios the L Dratio showed the most pronounced elevation in the metastatic breast cancer patients This is in good agreement with kinetic studies of the isomerisation and racemisation reactions where it was shown that the DCTX form accumulates with the lowest kinetic rate 9 The L DCTX ratio will thus be most affected by changes of bone turnover processes influencing the half life of collagen type I in the bone matrix The age related Lform accumulates with a slightly higher kinetic rate than DCTX 9 This is also apparent from the less pronounced increase in the L Lratio compared with the L Dratio in metastatic patients When individual Z scores of CTX were calculated for the metastatic breast cancer patients compared with the non metastatic patients the LCTX form and the L DCTX ratio showed the highest average increases in accordance with the ability of the LCTX levels and the L DCTX ratio to most sensitively reflect alterations in the balance between the anabolic and catabolic processes of bone turnover Fig 3 LCTX levels alone showed a significant elevation in 58 of the metastatic patients which probably reflects an increased bone turnover increased resorption increased formation as an important feature in the majority of bone metastatic patients For the Land DCTX markers respectively 47 and 48 of the metastatic patients had levels 2 SDs above the reference level of nonmetastasised controls Fig 3 The present data suggest that the levels of LCTX are most affected by the altered bone turnover associated with metastatic invasion of bone The fact that only 58 of patients affected by bone metastases as determined by radiology have increased levels of LCTX indicates a rather low sensitivity of bone resorption markers to identify bone metastases Several issues are relevant for the interpretation of this result It may be speculated that different stages of the bone metastases process show varying release of LCTX Furthermore the difference may be related to differences between sclerotic and lytic bone metastases In this context it is noteworthy that some patients who have not been classified as having bone metastases by radiological methods have LCTX values increased more than 2 SDs above the normal mean High levels of LCTX are indicative of an increased bone resorption In the clinical management of individual patients affected with breast cancer an increased LCTX value may indicate the presence of bone metastases and will call for a closer clinical evaluation of the patient and or initiation of preventive therapy e g bisphosphonates The study has some limitations Most patients received antineoplastic hormonal treatment 20 mg tamoxifen 500 mg aminoglutethimide 500 mg provera This treatment may potentially reduce bone resorption thereby influencing CTX levels It may thus be a confounding factor in the analysis In spite of this treatment however patients affected by bone metastases had highly increased marker values compared with healthy controls This indicates that the increase in markers is related to metastatic invasion of bone and is reflected in systemic marker levels regardless of the potential antiresorptive effects of antineoplastic therapy Conclusion Assays for the various age related isoforms of CTX have different sensitivities to identify patients affected by bone metastases The LCTX isoform reflecting resorption of young bone appeared to provide the best differentiation of patients affected by breast cancer induced bone metastases Further studies are needed to investigate the utility of this marker in the early detection of bone metastases and for assessing treatment efficacy Such studies should correlate marker values with metastasis type lytic sclerotic mixed and with the volume of bone affected by metastases Competing interests Paul
