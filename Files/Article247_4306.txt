 Dueling Media Moguls Morning Matt The promos tell me it s a heavy week of debates and I started doing my civic duty by watching Bradley with Chris Matthews last night Matthews idea of hardball aside from titling his show and his book identically so every pause for a commercial embeds a book plug seems to be to yell four half coherent questions in a row in a querulous Bostonian tenor Given such an interlocutor Roseanne would come off looking thoughtful I do get tired of Bradley s praying hands and I have no opinion on his tax plan or for that matter on anybody s tax plan but I admit to joining the dreaded media consensus that he and McCain generate less pain for me just as public personalities than the rest of the herd Alan Keyes was in that group too until he started complaining that he wasn t getting enough airtime because he s black Decoding life at the top begins and ends with the knowledge that Rupert Murdoch and Ted Turner despise each other The current New York Observer has a long piece about Rupert s roping ABC and CBS News into a footage sharing cartel with the main purpose being to get CNN s footage and logo off all three networks affiliates It s in this context that we should approach the Ted Jane split After all Rupert dumped his wife for a nice young Asian TV executive and got the former Mrs to tiptoe away nicely Ted must feel under pressure to do likewise or lose a round to the awful Aussie Speaking of sadly amicable divorces the Republicans are celebrating five years of running Congress and where s Newt I for one feel enormously cheated by the Gingrich settlement since we will apparently never know how Newt answered under oath questions about his affair with a young woman nominally his subordinate These answers would tell us whether or not as I ve long suspected Newt and Bill Clinton are one and the same person Here s a question for people who actually still cover as opposed to in the case of ABC and CBS share news Does the law shoved through Congress by the computer industry limiting product liability lawsuits connected to the Y2K bug prevent state attorneys general from suing If not I bet they re meeting with the lawyers behind the tobacco suits as we sip our coffees Today s Washington Post has quotes from Y2K chatrooms about disappointed doom expecters threatening to sue but they have yet to read that law I ll try not to be cavalier about this but asking me whether I ever play real people means you never saw my Mike Wallace or Alan Thicke on Saturday Night Live and more sadly means that you re one of the Washingtonians deprived of my radio broadcast Le Show on which you d hear Clinton Gore Newt Newt s mom Carville Dan Rather Tom Brokaw Hillary Monica Linda Tripp Ken Starr et al Whether or not those are real people of course is a judgment call Try RealAudioing at my Web site for the answer I like the Times giving R W I don t know him well enough to call him Johnny Apple all that space to indulge his love of food not to mention the apparent travel budget that s taken him from Sydney to Rome It s as if the Baltimore Sun suddenly said to Jack Germond Take the year off just hang out at the world s greatest racetracks and just write about horses
