        so uh what do you think   i think were overtaxed to the hilt   yeah   yeah i mean were were taxed on taxes and um uh most all government entities are just trying to give us a state income tax for those who dont have it that is i mean we dont have one yet but eventually they may try to push it through   oh really so they have no i didnt realize they had no state tax in Texas   no no state income tax   oh thats great because they dont have it in Florida in New York they have it   uhhuh   i mean you know like i say im in New York and we have a state tax as well so that just cuts even more   yeah i think what needs to be done is they need to control their spending habits   right i i think that i i mean i wouldnt be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it werent for the fact that they dont they dont go to any place you know you you dont see it going to any place where it belongs   right   i think if it were to be uh if it were to be um if it were to be hold hold on a second please someone just walked in the door   yeah     if if it were to be spent in the right way i think wouldnt be so upset about it but given that it that its not spent properly i think its a major problem   well were really overburdened from federal state and local that it takes such a size out of your paycheck that theres not a whole lot you can always do with your paycheck   well thats certainly true well what is it they were just talking about um sort of middle income you know how how middle income people what winds up happening is for instance having kids you know they wind up having kids as a deduction and after but the deduction is so little for kids that they wind up having to pay more in taxes than it costs to raise a kid for the year or something   uhhuh   i think that so they want to you know try and i think theyre trying i think that i think that most of the politicians understand this they just dont theyre just not very good at doing what theyre supposed to be doing   well theyre kind of put into a trap of being out there to please the special interest groups as well   right   and uh i think the only way that can be changed for us to get a a better tax revenue thats fairness and all is for us to limit their terms   uhhuh   and by doing so theyre not obligated to anybody   i agree i agree   and uh and uh i dont know how were going to do that right away though but what what in general though that taxes are doing to us is its just taking uh  a bite out of our savings   right exactly and then and then uh uh im im just not sure if i see you know if i see it going like i say to the right places i mean itd be itd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older   yeah   you know but im not convinced thats a that that Social Security is doing as well as it should and you know and and and uh and and that you know those people who need it for welfare and so forth who really need it for welfare not the eighty five to ninety percent of them who dont need it but i mean the real people who really need it you know should be getting it but instead i think its going to the wrong places   and i believe the Social Security tax is a great pondsy scheme   you think so   yeah its uh you know right now theyre robbing from it to pad the federal deficit   i know and that scares the hell out of me   and i bet thats illegal see if uh most company uh CEOs were to do that within their private company theyd be in jail   yeah   so how are we letting them get away with it   yeah i dont i dont well because because theyre the ones who make the laws  so whos going to yell at them you know itd be nice if we sort of as one band together and and uh and an performed a citizens arrest i guess   right yeah   to see if we could sort of clean them up and you know but i dont know if we can do that or not   a lot of people have become too complacent and believe everything is just the norm as to the way things are going and feel absolutely helpless to to oppose a lot of the situations going on in the taxing system   i agree i agree but um yeah like like you said i wonder you know if if its certainly not going to be a slow change process and i wonder if itll ever be a change process   yeah   i sort of i sort of get discouraged when i think about all the things that i think are wrong you know all those things that really could be changed that arent you know that that arent and taxes is one of those things that just sort of sits way up there on the list   yeah hum   so i dont know i i i have no idea what to do about it   well theres no quick solution or no sure fire easy answer its just going to take uh uh really uh uh uh a combination effort i think of the majority of the American people to come to a decisive answer or vote to limit the way its spent   yeah   see we were we have no say so as to where the money goes in the first place thats   right we dont i mean the only say so we have is supposedly by electing people who we think are going to vote one way of another   right and they are controlled or pretty much do what they want to do   right ive never quite understood that ive never uh you know even though um i ive never been uh sort of politically minded but its never been clear to me as to sort of um you know how Congressmen an can can just sort of go ahead and vote their own conscience as their own ideas when clearly their constituency does doesnt back them up on anything you know and often times that will happen   well they feel invulnerable invulnerable to uh   right   any wrath or uh its its occurred so many times that they figure people will usually forget and dont think about it when the election time arises   right   and generally it does work out that way   they do forget its true could because everybody think of what happens is whenever the politician whenever the the one who made that supposed mistake turns around and uh his his or her opponent can say well look they did this and they can turn around and say well my opponent did this   uhhuh   so it becomes uh a general battle of the who sort of the election of the lesser of two evils   yeah   i think so i dont know i just uh im unhappy with it but and well im im sort of semi fortunate right now im a graduate student so i dont make that much what i make isnt taxed very highly because im still in school   well when you get out into the real world then you will know   but its my my my wife has a real job and you know when i get her job um you know we we look at her paycheck im just floored whe n i see how little of it were actually allowed to keep   yeah   especially around bonus time   bonus time you have a bonus   bonus she no my my wife does   oh   my wife i dont no graduate students dont get bonuses were lucky to get paychecks the way i figure   uhhuh so youre taxed on the bonuses too right   my my wife is taxed on her bonus as well and thats a thats usually a big chunk of her bonus check actually i mean her bonus isnt that much but they tax it as i i guess they tax it as if   uhhuh   that were her weekly check or something   uhhuh   so she gets destroyed on her bonus check   uhhuh   so she works with in in in sales so a good portion of her you know her salary is is quarterly bonuses   uh sales is lucrative but then youre paying really high taxes when youre doing a lucrative job   yes well yeah shes not entirely sales so it isnt it isnt as lucrative as one would hope but it it keeps us supported temporarily   uhhuh   until i can get a real salary and then get taxed more so i dont know i dont i guess i guess at this point in time were just sort of going to have to live with it and hope that it gets better   yeah well i have i guess about said what all all i can think of to say   same here tough topic so   yeah its really a rather touchy topic at that but   i believe i i i do agree with you most most wholeheartedly its been a pleasure talking with you   well thats great you too and uh have a good day   thanks for calling you too byebye
