 SPAN class 660525219 21091999 Barbie s Malibu Dream Knee SPAN Barbie Gives the Finger Jane Bahor an anaplastologist at Duke University Medical Center has discovered a new use for the Barbie doll By placing one of Barbie s legs inside a hollow prosthetic finger Bahor discovered that Barbie s transplanted knee joint gave patients greater mechanical flexibility and control over their artificial digits Although you could previously only move joints that were in the hand as opposed to the fingers the plastic in the legs of Barbie dolls allows patients to position fingers in different flexion she told the Duke University Chronicle Glenn Hostetter the medical center prosthetics clinical supervisor noted that the technique is an inexpensive way to provide articulation in a finger and that it will help prosthetic fingers become functional as well as cosmetic appendages The Ascent of Darwin A University of Kansas library has mounted a small exhibit illustrating the ideas of Charles Darwin

reasons Head of the Class An unusual fossil skull which may contain new clues about human evolution was discovered in an Upper West Side curio shop The New York Times reports that the skull arrived in the shop as part of a collection of rocks minerals and curios The shop owner recognized its significance after he cleaned it and turned it over to scientists at the nearby American Museum of Natural History Paleoanthropologists examining the skull have traced its origins to Indonesia and presume it to be that of a Homo erectus However they also note that the skull which probably belonged to a man in his 20s has a high humanlike forehead not the sloping kind typical of Homo erectus and other early hominids It s not like any other Homo erectus we know from Indonesia or anywhere else said Dr Eric Delson the City College of New York paleoanthropologist directing the investigation Of course it s only one individual but it could represent a distinctive population Bullshit Bullshit Bullshit A team of Canadian psychologists believes that Tourette s syndrome the condition that leads patients to suffer muscular spasms and to blurt out obscenities may be a psychological rather than a physical disorder Sufferers may actually be able to control their sputterings according to experiments led by Randy Flanagan at Queen s University in Ontario BBC Online reports In one experiment a Tourette s patient was directed to hold a weighted box loaded with sensors Anticipating the patient s regular tics the researchers monitored how his grip on the sensor box changed as his arm twitched They observed the subject adjusting his grip on the box just before experiencing a tic indicating that at some level he was in control of his actions Flanagan concluded Tourette s sufferers have motor control over these tics and these movements look normal and have all the same sort of response we would expect to see in voluntary movement He also suggested that his findings may point the way toward behavioral therapy for the syndrome Click here for a summary of the experiment No More Teachers No More Books No More Notes Either College students drop your pencils StudentU com an Internet startup

anthropology professor Shepard Krech III Working from firsthand reports as well as archeological and scientific data Krech asserts that Native Americans are not the proto environmentalists so fondly imagined by spiritually undernourished Americans in the words of The New Yorker s Nicholas Lemann Rather they hunted species into extinction exhausted large stretches of land and mismanaged natural
