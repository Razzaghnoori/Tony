 Plain Folk Harry Smith 1923 1991 was a self created character deserving of a novel no one has yet written Small gnomelike with an acerbic high pitched voice he was a tramp scholar who in a peripatetic life on the fringes became a recognized authority on Seminole fabrics Ukrainian Easter eggs and the ubiquity of string figures in the world s cultures He was a record producer an adept of black magic and an avant garde filmmaker who pioneered among other things the kind of collage animation later made famous by Monty Python s Terry Gilliam He began collecting 78 rpm recordings in the early 1940s acquiring thousands of race and hillbilly works from the junk shops of the Pacific Northwest before they could be melted down their shellac recuperated for the war effort In 1952 he assembled 84 of these songs in an anthology that was at once systematic and intuitive In three volumes Ballads Social Music and Songs he gathered blues gospel hymns murder narratives reels and jigs Cajun tunes sermons and ancient Child ballads transmuted from their British origins by centuries in the mountains and valleys of America He laid down a few ground rules The material had to have been recorded commercially between 1927 when electronic recording made possible accurate music reproduction and 1932 when the Depression halted folk music sales otherwise he was guided only by serendipity and his own ears Yet he succeeded in making a collection that was definitive in its selections and mysteriously cohesive the diverse offerings falling together like strands of a single design You have to remember that at the time no one had an overview on this stuff Few people knew any of it besides some old timers and a scattering of enthusiasts folk music meant either the topical work of Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly or the kind of art song taxidermy practiced by the likes of the baritone John Jacob Niles Slowly and invisibly the Anthology captivated and influenced a generation It was the ur text for the folk music boom of the early 1960s It was plundered by everybody especially Bob Dylan who swiped alluded and rewrote so much in the spirit of the original works among which lines and verses migrate freely that he forcefully inserted himself into the tradition After that though the collection s fame returned underground Few people born after 1950 had heard of it despite its remaining in print until Folkways Records dissolved when its owner Moe Asch died in the mid 1980s It has finally been reissued in a lavish package full disclosure I contributed a small reminiscence of Smith to the liner notes This took some doing because the Anthology was in effect a bootleg the original recordings had been imperfectly documented if at all the artists were paid small flat fees and sent in most cases back to obscurity but the copyrights had accrued to large publishing consortiums The packaging while splendid and including helpful and sometimes inspiring essays complete documentation and an enhanced CD containing films and recordings of and by Smith is maybe too lavish by half since its price tag will put it far beyond the means of young people It is to be hoped that its volumes will be issued individually Nevertheless it is available again and its importance cannot be overstated Reviewing it in the New York Times Tom Piazza was reminded of Edmund Wilson s The Shock of Recognition Bruce Shapiro in The Nation compared it to the reprinting of Moby Dick in the 1920s Such assertions might make you suspicious but they are not hyperbole Consider that Smith who said he searched for records that sounded odd or exotic managed to include an array of composers and performers who rather than being typical or representative the goal of most makers of field recordings were singular artists Some were truly weird others major innovators whose stature would only be recognized later Blues radical Charley Patton was forgotten Dock Boggs and Frank Hutchinson have barely been given their due even now Click to hear Boggs menacing combination of blues and high lonesome mountain styling Consider also that Smith deliberately avoided identifying the performers by race It took years before anybody discovered that Mississippi John Hurt wasn t a hillbilly he said and it is just as surprising to find out that such bluesmen as Hutchinson and Richard Rabbit Brown were white The Anthology is a picture of what indigenous American music was like before the age of mass media at a time when songs and ideas could only be transmitted by live performance and by rumor and yet circulated far and fast among musicians isolated by race or poverty or lost in rural backwaters The migratory quality of lyrics the fact that lines and whole verses traveled from this song to that one from blues to mountain ballad or vice versa regardless of origin or even sense made for a sort of native Surrealism a collage by accretion It also shows how profoundly linked black and white cultures were African and Anglo traditions twined around and through each other like closely planted trees Tradition for that matter coexisted with experimentation so that it is not always immediately obvious which is which you might not realize from listening that Blind Lemon Jefferson was an innovator who transformed the blues and influenced every subsequent artist in the genre or that the shape note singing of the Sacred Harp choirs represents a late vestige of a style that may have reached its acme of prevalence around the time of the American Revolution All of it in any case sounds new and fresh and enduringly strange There is history here of all sorts Kelly Harrell impersonating Charles Guiteau President Garfield s assassin the Carolina Tar Heels voicing the lament of shoemakers made redundant by the Industrial Revolution Charlie Poole singing Roosevelt in the White House he s doing his best McKinley in the graveyard he s taking his rest Other songs date back to the 16 th century or the 17 th or the 18 th Then Patton appearing here under his record company imposed pseudonym the Masked Marvel cuts loose with Mississippi Boweavil Blues a number as new and startling and disruptive today as it was the day he wrote it dispensing with verse chorus he barks and then punctuates with two klaxon notes rock n roll There are compelling grotesqueries The Fatal Flower Garden by Nelstone s Hawaiians and items of ineffable grandeur such as the hymn by the Alabama Sacred Harp Singers Blind Willie Johnson and his wife sing about the Book of the Seven Seals but not so great a distance separates them from Rabbit Brown who sings Sometimes I think that you re too sweet to die but other times I think you ought to be buried alive Clarence Ashley will build his cabin up on the mountain so he can see Willie fly by and warns that the railroad men will drink up your blood like wine and Jim Jackson lowers the cadaver of his old dog on a silver chain as with every link he calls his name Murder deception defiance laughter orgy rapture and arcadia are all represented there isn t a number that doesn t exude passion The Anthology of American Folk Music as pure and exalted and lowdown and variegated an article of the native culture as you ll find anywhere is no museum piece as well as being ancient it is sensational vivid and wild
