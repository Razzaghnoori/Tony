 Background Over the past five years in situ hybridization techniques employing tyramide amplification reagents have been developed and promise the potential detection of low single copy nucleic acid sequences However the increased sensitivity that tyramide amplification brings about may also lead to problems of background staining that confound data interpretation In this study factors that allow reproducible sensitive and clean biotinyl tyramide based in situ hybridization assay have been investigated Formalin fixed paraffin embedded FFPE human papillomavirus HPV positive cell lines SiHa HeLa and CaSki as well as FFPE cervical lesions pre invasive and invasive infected with HPV have been used as model systems In addition metaphase chromosome spreads prepared from SiHa cells have been examined Materials Cell Lines SiHa cells which contain 1 2 copies of HPV 16 integrated at chromosome 13q21 31 HeLa cells which contain up to 50 copies of HPV 18 integrated at 5 sites and CaSki cells which contain up to 600 copies of HPV 16 integrated at multiple sites 1 were obtained from the ATCC Manassas VA After culture cells were fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde PBS and then suspended in 2 agar in normal saline The plug of fixed cells was then paraffin embedded by routine processing Slides of paraffin embedded SiHa cells were also supplied with the GenPoint tyramide reagent kit DAKO

chromosome 11 61398 D12Z1 chromosome 12 and 65442 D17Z1 chromosome 17 Plasmid insert DNA sequences were isolated from bacterial cultures by column purification Qiagen Valencia CA and were biotin labeled by nick translation Invitrogen Carlsbad CA Methods and Results Section Preparation and Dewaxation Six micrometer thick sections were floated onto slides using autoclaved distilled water in the preparation bath ADCELL slides Erie Scientific Company Portsmouth NH were found to provide excellent retention of tissues during NISH processing and were marginally better than home prepared silane coated slides in terms of non specific staining of glass Sections were baked onto slides overnight at 55 C Sections were dewaxed with xylene washed with 100 ethanol 90 ethanol and 75 ethanol and rehydrated with sterile distilled water Tissue Unmasking Non Protease Unmasking Five regimens were tested no pretreatment 10 mM sodium citrate pH6 0 90 95 C 30 40 minutes with and without the addition of 0 1 Triton 100 mM Tris HCl pH 6 0 pH 10 0 80 95 C 15 40 minutes 1 M sodium thiocyanate 80 C 10 minutes After dewaxation and air drying slides were immersed in these solutions in Coplin jars pre heated to temperature in water baths After incubation Coplin jars were removed from the water bath and slides immersed in sodium citrate or Tris HCl and were allowed to sit in solution for a further 20 minutes before being rinsed with water and air dried Non inclusion of one of these steps predisposed to background staining Cleanest results were obtained with a sodium citrate step There was no benefit to sensitivity of background by inclusion of Triton which tended to result in loss of tissue from slides Several other pre treatments regimens were not tested These include the use of 1 mM EDTA pH8 0 at high temperature and tissue unmasking solutions available from BioGenex DAKO Zymed and other companies Protease Unmasking Protease digestion was essential to enable target signal detection with any of the above unmasking aids Three proteases were tested pepsin 0 2 M HCl proteinase K PBS and protease VIII PBS Pepsin 0 2 M HCl digest preceded by sodium citrate treatment yielded the cleanest and most sensitive detection of viral and chromosomal sequences The pepsin solution was prepared by heating 50 mls of 0 2 M HCl to 37 C and then mixing in 100 mg of pepsin Sigma P 7012 Sigma St Louis MO Pepsin was allowed to dissolve for 20 minutes then 2 ml was mixed with 38 ml 0 2 M HCl at room temperature 25 C to yield a 100 g ml solution Slides were incubated with this solution at 25 C for 2 minutes fixed cell lines up to 35 minutes CIN lesions The majority of FFPE pathology specimens required 15 minutes digestion Slides were then rinsed with water washed in three changes of PBS 0 05 Tween 20 for a total of 15 minutes and then rinsed in water Tissues were then immersed in methanol 0 6 hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes as a precaution against endogenous peroxidase followed by water rinses for 15 minutes and were then air dried The three proteases were tested in the absence of non protease unmasking steps Pepsin and proteinase K were tested with all four non protease unmasking steps and protease VIII was only tested in combination with sodium citrate unmasking Overall tissue unmasking was found to be one of the most critical steps for sensitive detection Post digestion fixation Including post digestion fixation steps with 4 paraformaldehyde or methanol acetic acid 4 1 in the NISH assay were investigated when pepsin or proteinase K were used with or without sodium citrate No benefits to sensitivity or background cleanliness were identified Hybridization Hybridization Mix Components Dextran Sulfate Sigma was tested at concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 and formamide Sigma at concentrations ranging from 20 to 60 using pepsin with or without sodium citrate unmasking regimen Other proteases used were tested with 10 dextran sulphate 50 formamide The following buffer solutions were tested 2X SSC 300 mM NaCl 30 mM sodium citrate 2X SSPE 300 mM NaCl 20 mM NaH 2 PO 4 2 mM EDTA and 2X STE 300 mM NaCl 50 mM Tris HCl 2 mM EDTA Solutions were tested at pH 6 0 6 5 7 0 7 5 and 8 0 using a pepsin sodium citrate regimen Otherwise the proteases used with or without tissue pretreatment were tested only with 2X SSC pH7 0 Sonicated human placental DNA Sigma D3287 at a concentration of 400 ng l hybridization mix was included when using an HPV probe Sonicated salmon sperm DNA Sigma at the same concentration was included when human sequence centromeric probes were used A commercially available hybridization mix DAKO S3305 was also assessed HPV or centromeric plasmid was labeled with biotin by nick translation Invitrogen Life Technologies Carlsbad CA Nick translation reactions were allowed to progress for different lengths of time to enable the effect of probe size to be examined Size of heat denatured i e single strand probe fragments was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis of denatured probe followed by Southern transfer and demonstration of biotin by BluGene kit Invitrogen Life Technologies Probes were purified through mini columns Qiagen and tested at concentrations ranging from 0 1 up to 2 ng l hybridization mix This assessment was performed for tissues treated according to the protocol listed in Table 1 Absence of dextran sulfate resulted in background problems and at a concentration of 20 sensitivity was significantly reduced The tested range of formamide concentrations had little effect on background staining Hybridization mixes prepared with STE invariably gave background problems There was little difference between SSC and SSPE buffers Hybridization mix pH was found to be important Sensitivity was significantly reduced at pH 7 0 Background was significantly increased at pH 7 5 It was noted that the pH of a 2X SSC solution diluted from 20X SSC pH 7 0 had a pH of 7 8 and that it was preferable to adjust pH hybridization mix buffer formamide dextran sulfate directly Probes nick translated to yield denatured fragments primarily ranging in size from 500 bases to 100 bases yielded strongest and cleanest signals Sensitivity was significantly lowered when single strand probe fragment size was predominantly below 200 bases in length Probe concentration was important for sensitivity which dropped noticeably when the concentration was below 0 5 ng l It was not possible to compensate for loss in sensitivity by subsequently increasing the concentration of detection reagents To detect the 1 2 copies of HPV 16 in SiHa cells HPV probe at a concentration of 1 ng l was sufficient Centromeric probes were used at 0 5 ng l concentration Dirty Probes Background free results were obtained for all centromeric probes tested and most HPV type probes tested However certain HPV probes such as that for type 31 were consistently associated with non specific background staining This problem remained despite repeat preparation of plasmid by column extraction Qiagen repeat nick translation of probe to yield different sized fragments and repeat purifications of labeled probe through mini columns Qiagen or by isopropanol precipitation This suggests the staining is somehow related to the physical properties of the probe sequence structure and is not due to some unidentified contaminant However this non specific staining was virtually eliminated when the commercially supplied hybridization mix DAKO was used together with pH controlled post hybridization washes see below A number of other hybridization mix additives that may benefit sensitivity background were not tested These include ficoll polyvinylpyrolidone bovine serum albumin individually or together i e Denhardt s reagent sodium dodecyl sulfate Tween 20 and Triton X 100 Hybridization mix is also available from other commercial companies such as BioGenex Denaturation Hybridization mix was applied to sections and coverslips were sealed with rubber cement Slides were placed into Terasaki plates containing 2 mls 5X SSC The Terasaki plates were then placed onto a 2 cm thick aluminum block preheated in an oven set at 95 C Terasaki plates were removed after 17 minutes This form of denaturation was found to be marginally more effective than placing slides directly onto the heated block for 5 minutes Hybridization temperature and time Hybridization conditions and post hybridization washes determine ISH assay stringency i e the number of matched mismatched sequences permitted between a probe and its target The melting temperature T m is determined by a number of factors that include temperature monovalent cation concentration formamide pH probe fragment length GC content and mismatched hybrids Herrington and colleagues have specifically examined T m as it applies to ISH and have defined the term tissue T m T m t having noted that the theoretical T m derived from analysis of solution kinetics did not match the empirically derived value for T m in HPV ISH assays using full length probes suggesting that hybridization involving tissue sections involves additional determinants of T m After several studies 6 7 8 it was concluded that the main difference between T m and T m tis probably due to the use of a different end point for measurement e g a chromogenic stain following application of intermediary reagents rather than biochemical alteration of DNA DNA interactions measured by spectrophotometry 8 It was also concluded that mismatched probe targets should be removed using empirically derived post hybridization washing conditions in order to achieve specificity and that appropriate conditions should be determined by experiment rather than calculated theoretically from T m In a later study Herrington et al 9 examined the ability of ISH to discriminate HPV types using full length plasmid probes It was concluded that when using a high sensitivity system in which high copy number infection is present then ISH can lead to erroneous typing data Accordingly HPV typing of lesions in the present study was determined by PCR assay and hybridization wash conditions were then optimized empirically for sensitivity and clean background using the appropriate HPV type probe as indicated following the PCR Hybridizations that included sonicated human placental DNA in the hybridization mix were tested at 42 C and 37 C for 2 hours or overnight Highest sensitivity and cleanest background was obtained with overnight 37 C incubations followed by high stringency washes see below Controls Nick translated biotin labeled pUC18 plasmid was used as a control for non specific probe binding and HPV probes were also applied to normal cervical tissues It was confirmed that a plasmid vector probe did not result in hybridization signal with an HPV positive lesion and that HPV probe did not result in signal with normal tissue Post Hybridization Washes SSC SSPE and STE buffers at pH 6 0 6 5 7 0 7 5 and 8 0 were tested as variables of the protocol listed in Table 1 After pealing away rubber cement slides were immersed in 2X buffer 0 05 Tween 20 and coverslips were eased off slides Slides were then washed at stringency 2X 0 1X buffer 0 05 Tween 20 at 37 C 55 C with or without 50 60 formamide As with hybridization mix wash buffer pH was an important factor for a clean result Background tended to occur at pH6 0 and at pH8 0 Sensitivity was reduced at pH7 0 STE buffer gave background problems possibly because the pH of this buffer tended to decrease as temperature increased whereas SSC and SSPE better retained pH The use or otherwise of formamide did not alter background staining status HPV signal in SiHa cells remained detectable washing in up to 0 2X SSC 0 05 Tween 20 at 55 C Detection of Biotin Chromogen Peroxidase was demonstrated using either DAB 3 3 diaminobenzidene DAKO or AEC 3 amino 9 ethylcarbazole Sigma Use of AEC was of particular benefit in avoiding non specific background staining In addition the signal from AEC tended to be more discrete than that from DAB The 1 2 copies of HPV 16 in SiHa cells were readily detectable using AEC which was applied for 5 10 minutes A more intense stain was obtained with DAB which was applied for 1 3 minutes Tissues were counterstained with hematoxylin Punctate signals indicative of integration see discussion were demonstrated with CaSki HeLa SiHa and carcinoma samples Figure 1A 1B 1C 1D 1E 1F Diffuse signals indicative of episomal HPV diffuse and punctate or punctate signals alone were demonstrated amongst pre invasive lesion samples Figure 2A 2Band 2C These lesions were deliberately over or under digested There was no evidence that punctate signals were a consequence of inadequate tissue unmasking Punctate signal patterns in a tissue unmasked at one set of digestion conditions continued to be detectable as punctate signal under more severe unmasking conditions Similarly diffuse signal patterns did not appear as punctate when tissue was subject to less severe unmasking conditions Aneusomic chromosome counts were also demonstrated following assay with centromeric probes Figure 2D Comparisons of AEC and DAB on cervical tissues ISH processed with DAKO wide spectrum probe are shown in Figures 3 normal tissue 5 condylomatous lesion 6 CIN I 8 CIN II 9 CIN III and 10 squamous cell carcinoma Figures 4and 7demonstrate normal cervix and CIN I tissues hybridized with biotin labeled pUC18 vector Samples Figures 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 were similarly processed apart from incubation with AEC or DAB The authors prefer AEC because 1 Single copy HPV 16 in SiHa cells is detectable using AEC 2 In the author s hands DAB generally tended to result in background staining using the optimized protocol Table 1 or the protocol supplied with the GenPoint kit Background was found to be present even after 1 minute substrate incubation This staining has a grainy appearance that could be mistaken for punctate signals Punctate like signals were found even with normal cervix hybridized with HPV probe Figure 4B or lesion hybridized with plasmid vector control probe Figure 7B and were commonly found congregated around nuclei circumferences and also in cytoplasm Figures 3B 4B 5B 6B 7B 8B 9B 10B 3 AEC did not result in this type of staining Leaving specimens in AEC for up to 20 minutes only tended to result in a pinkish blush to tissues and not the grainy background obtained with DAB Therefore it was easy to interpret signals obtained using AEC as genuine HPV related correlates whereas with DAB diffuse signals were easy to interpret but the interpretation of punctate signals was generally open to question Occasionally non specific staining was noted with AEC at the surperficial layers of normal epithelium demonstrating parakeratosis Metaphase Spreads SiHa Metaphase Chromosome Spread Preparation Cells were split media changed and 0 1 g ml colcemid added 48 h 24 h and 4 6 h prior to chromosome preparation respectively After trypsinization cells were centrifuged at 400 g for 5 min swollen in 75 mM KCl for 10 min at 37 C re centrifuged and fixed in methanol acetic acid 3 1 at 4 C before dropping cells onto slides Hybridization Slides of metaphase spreads were treated with 2 paraformaldehyde PBS then rinsed with 0 2 glycine PBS PBS and water then air dried Hybridization wash and detection conditions were then applied as above except that chromosomes were denatured by placing slides directly onto a heating block set at 75 C for 7 min HPV 16 signal was not detected by staining with AEC or DAB Detection conditions were modified to enable fluorescent assay which successfully revealed integrated signal Following application of primary streptavidin peroxidase 1 300 and biotinyl tyramide streptavidin FITC Sigma S3762 was applied at a final concentration of 0 0125 mg ml diluted in PBS 0 05 Tween 20 and incubated at room temperature with the chromosome spreads for 30 minutes After staining with DAPI chromosomes were visualized by fluorescence microscopy HPV 16 has been shown to be integrated at 13q21 q31 by in situ hybridization analysis with 3H labeled probe and chromosome identification by Geimsa staining 10 and by detection of biotin labeled HPV probe detected with avidin FITC which enabled detection of integrated HPV in metaphase spreads as a pin prick signal 11 The SiHa cell line is aneusomic and has been found to contain 66 72 chromosomes but to be diploid for the acrocentric chromosome 13 10 Metaphase spreads hybridized with biotin labeled HPV 16 probe detected with biotinyl tyramide and streptavidin FITC consistently demonstrated intense signal in the central region of the long arm of an acrocentric chromosome Figures 1Eand 1F By comparison with previous studies 10 11 and because of the consistency of this result it is concluded that this signal represents the integrated HPV 16 on chromosome 13 There is no commercially available centromeric probe for chromosome 13 to enable additional support for this interpretation Discussion In this study the factors that enable consistent sensitive but background free in situ hybridization for DNA sequences using biotinyl tyramide reagent have been investigated Different protocols were compared and assessed according to two criteria Firstly whether the protocol was sufficiently sensitive to routinely detect single copy 8 kb HPV 16 in SiHa cells chromosome spreads and secondly whether the protocol routinely gave a clean background on archival FFPE tissues According to these criteria a protocol has been optimized for routine use Table 1 that allows detection of the 1 2 copies of HPV 16 DNA integrated into the genome of SiHa cells utilizing a chromogenic end point This protocol has been successfully applied to cell line models Figures 1A 1B 1C and to examine HPV infections amongst archival FFPE cervical carcinoma Figure 1D and CIN lesions Figures 2A 2B 2C Integration of HPV16 in metaphase chromosome spreads prepared from the SiHa cell line has also been demonstrated using a fluorescent reporter molecule Figures 1Eand 1F The most important factors for high sensitivity were the use a sodium citrate step followed by the use of pepsin HCl for tissue unmasking the use of probes at a concentration of 0 5 ng l hybridization mix and the concentration of primary streptavidin peroxidase That HPV DNA integrated into metaphase chromosomes was detectable by fluorescence but not chromogenic stains indicates an additional order of sensitivity is possible by combination of biotinyl tyramide with reagents such as FITC A sodium citrate tissue unmasking step was also of key importance for the elimination of background staining AEC was the chromogen of choice for clean background Certain probes were more dirty than others Composition and pH of hybridization mix and post hybridization wash buffer pH were important in these instances The optimized protocol was applied to archival FFPE cervical carcinomas and CIN lesions for the detection of HPV DNA Punctate signals were detected amongst carcinomas and high grade CIN lesions but were rare amongst non conylomatous CIN I lesions which were characterized by diffuse signals occupying entire nuclei and detectable in the mid superficial layers These observations are consistent with earlier studies that a punctate signal is representative of integration and a diffuse signal of episomal HPV and with the theory that integration is an important factor in lesion progression 2 12 The data suggest the optimized method may be useful in screening CIN lesions for integration However further studies are required to confirm a punctate signal is only representative of integration The demonstration of 1 2 copies of integrated HPV DNA detected as punctate signal begs the question as to why single low copy episomal HPV is not also detectable as punctate signal Initial infection with HPV is understood to occur in the basal layer of the epithelium and productive replication is tied to cell differentiation maturation Figure 2A 13 HPV was not detected by the assay in basal parabasal cells of non condylomatous CIN I lesions 30 examined unless HPV 16 positive 2 suggesting low copy number episomal HPV was not detectable and indicating a limit to the sensitivity of the assay A possible explanation maybe that that 8 kilo base single low copy episomal HPV sequences may be subject to relatively more degradation and loss from tissues during routine processing than HPV DNA that is physically integrated into the human chromosome 50 250 mega base pairs Excessive degradation may affect retention of DNA sequences during in situ hybridization assay as well as hybridization efficiency Additionally alternatively the sensitivity of the assay on archival tissues may be less than that on the SiHa cell line model despite attempting equivalent procedures through formalin fixation and routine paraffin embedding If this is the case then punctate signal detected in carcinomas and high grade CIN lesions may only represent integration of multiple copies of HPV at sites within the genome and low copy episomal or integrated DNA may remain sub threshold on archival FFPE samples Episomal HPV can also occur in the form of concatamers comprising multiple copies of the HPV genome compounded into super molecules It can be speculated that these forms could also give rise to punctate signals Centromeric probe signal was readily demonstrable using biotinyl tyramide based in situ hybridization Figure 2D Currently numerical chromosome count is generally determined by hybridization with directly labeled fluorescent probes This has the advantages of allowing simultaneous assay of two or more differently labeled probes and detection directly after post hybridization washes The disadvantage is the requirement for specialized microscopy visualization of tissue specimens through multiple filters multiple image capture and the relatively short half life during which signal is visible Biotinyl tyramide assay has the disadvantage of requiring several incubations to detect biotin label It has the advantages of allowing hematoxylin counterstaining that allows easier determination of cell tissue morphology visualization by bright field microscopy and signal that is available for counting more than one year after test application slides have been kept in the dark Unequivocal signal was also demonstrated to the authors knowledge for first time by a tyramide based assay of the 1 2 copies of HPV16 integrated at chromosome 13q21 31 Figure 1Eand 1F on metaphase spreads prepared from SiHa cells There are many variables associated with tyramide ISH In this study a number of these have been systematically examined and a sensitive background free assay has been demonstrated In this study biotin labeled probes and biotinylated tyramide were utilized Background may also be reduced by using digoxigenin labeled probe and anti digoxigenin antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase before the amplification step of biotinyl tyramide Dr Chao Cheng Huang personal communication Possibly oligonucleotide probes may also give less background than full length sequences Non biotin based tyramide reagents including fluorescent reagents are available from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and from DAKO These reagents used in conjunction with non biotin labeled probes may be particularly beneficial for applications on tissues where endogenous biotin is problematic An additional level of sensitivity may be possible on tissues using fluorescene given the finding that HPV integrated on chromosome spreads could be demonstrated with FITC but not AEC or DAB Conclusions A biotinyl tyramide based in situ hybridization protocol has been optimized that allows sensitive detection of DNA sequences in FFPE tissues and metaphase spreads The protocol is especially robust with respect to absence of background staining that can limit assay interpretation As such the protocol may have clinical utility in the survey of routine cervical samples for HPV punctate signals that are associated with high grade lesions Additionally the method can be used to detect numerical chromosome aberrations in archival pathology samples and so represents an alternative to the use of FISH assays that require specialized microscopy Competing interests None declared Authors Contributions MFE conceived the study performed the in situ
