 McCivil Disobedience Dear Steve OK OK I ll admit that nuclear war sucks I ll come right out and say it I personally oppose the intentional release of radiation near human skin unless that skin happens to belong to people I don t personally like But the bottom line is that you can t put the nuke genie back in the bottle because human behavior inevitably declines to its lowest common denominator in other words we all act like the meanest stupidest person in whatever group we happen to be in So these pacts will inevitably disintegrate to the worst behavior of their signatories in the long run I dunno I have a fond spot in my anti free trade heart ever notice how the only thing free about free trade is the average salary the corporations have in mind for the rest of us for that French guy He should have got sued sure and jail was entirely appropriate for this particular act of civil disobedience but as an occasional customer of the Golden Arches personally I prefer Wendy s and French American dual national it s splendid to see someone willing to take a risk for their principles now and then particularly when it s a blow against a monolithic transnational corporation that built itself up by underpaying children who ought to be at home studying for the next day of school rather than learning the mysteries of deep frying every night By the way it only seems appropriate to include a little cartooning commentary here Today s New York Post cartoon by Sean Delonas depicts a recently divorced Michael Jackson out on the town ogling stripping babies Is it just me or is this more boring than offensive Second question Does anyone other than the Brits call Michael Jackson Jacko Just asking Ciao Ted
