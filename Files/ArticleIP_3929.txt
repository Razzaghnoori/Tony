Andrew Sullivan dialogue in The Book Club about my new anthology Unauthorized Freud Doubters Confront a Legend 1 One of the few points on which these commentators fully agree is that I am a village atheist They are however sadly mistaken I was born and raised in Philadelphia 2 It is true alas as Sullivan observes that I am not in command of my senses and that in fact I am an outright maniac I must also concede that my articles on Freud and the recovered memory movement in the New York Review of Books articles that Sullivan hasn t read were as he judges tirades But from now on by virtue of studying Sullivan s own understated prose I hope to cultivate a more rational and deliberate manner 3 Does Crews need to see a shrink Sullivan is not the first reader to have posed this profound diagnostic question Indeed it has been the standard retort pioneered by no less an authority than Freud himself that Freudians throw back at those who challenge the empirical credentials of psychoanalysis See the concluding chapter of my book The Memory Wars 1995 4 It is less than cogent to view the historical Freud through the lens of one s own contemporary psychotherapeutic involvement Nor it is helpful to lump psychoanalysis and psychotherapy together as Sullivan does I have never attacked psychotherapy by which I mean the general enterprise of helping people talk through their anxieties and face the difficulties in their immediate circumstances The target of my skepticism has been psychodynamic therapy whereby the patient s manifestly perceived problems beliefs and feelings are treated as mere compromise formations tossed to the surface by deep turmoil that can only be resolved by dredging for repressed memories Oedipal cravings and the like If I am to be deemed a maniac let s at least try to state correctly what it is I ve been raving about 5 Nearly everyone who is ignorant of the critical literature assumes that Freud made some genuine discoveries but the list varies according to taste Sullivan for example is quite sure that Freud was right about repression resistance transference the Oedipus complex dream interpretation and God help us the probable origins of homosexuality Thus when Sullivan found me asserting what nearly any research professor of psychology could have told him that not one distinctively Freudian concept or hypothesis has survived independent scrutiny he gave a horrified glance at my chapter titles abandoned Unauthorized Freud and pronounced me insane If he had kept on reading as Pollitt did he would have encountered reasoned arguments by philosophers and historians challenging each and every Freudian notion that he considers self evident 6 Pollitt and Sullivan alike deem me insensitive to the depth and complexity of the psyche and Sullivan warmly endorses psychoanalyst Jonathan Lear s admonition that we dare not reject Freud lest those qualities drop out of sight But neither Pollitt nor Sullivan nor Lear understands that psychoanalysis has been a means of simplifying the mind by presuming sexual and aggressive motives to be invariably primary and by invoking deterministic mechanisms that always lead to a few banal and arbitrary causative factors As my introduction points out psychoanalysis would be helpless to address the intricacy of Freud s own devious and supersubtle mind Only when we have grasped the full extent of the Freudian intellectual fiasco it is adumbrated in my book but exhaustively explored in Malcolm Macmillan s Freud Evaluated The Completed Arc 1997 will we be able to talk about motives with an adequate respect for their actual variety and volatility 7 Finally Pollitt and Sullivan are disappointed that Unauthorized Freud doesn t pay homage to Freud s cultural importance in our century True but I fully grant that importance Quite simply my book asks whether it was attained with or without the benefit of accurate clinical observation defensible drawing of inferences and encouraging therapeutic results The answer is without them Once that fact has sunk in a cultural historian can assess the true magnitude of the problem that Unauthorized Freud only glancingly treats how 20 th century secular intellectuals not excepting journalists in therapy could have been so thoroughly bamboozled Frederick Crews Berkeley Calif High and Mighty A Low Blow About Seth Stevenson s July 23 article High and Mighty The Partnership for a Drug Free America has never claimed that all drug use leads to disaster Our advertising is based on a breadth of research from which we develop specific campaigns depending on the drug and the demographic we re targeting There s a huge difference for example between smoking marijuana and smoking heroin and between communicating to an 8 year old or a 14 year old Take a look Our advertising does not and never has treated all drugs equally Stevenson s article shows a fundamental lack of understanding about what our campaign entails Had he contacted us we would have been happy to discuss our advertising as well as our research We would still be open to such a discussion We welcome scrutiny into our advertising campaign and our organization but here s one suggestion How about waiting for some results before deciding this can t possibly work and how about reading the existing research that shows it can The Impact of Anti Drug

uncritical movie critics is wrong I think to suggest that mainstream critics should ignore blockbusters or dismiss them in a paragraph Most readers of mass circulation newspapers and magazines are intensely interested in such titles and I find my reviews of movies such as Godzilla Armageddon The Lost World Starship Troopers Lost in Space Halloween H20 BASEketball Air Force One etc to be invaluable opportunities to help open their eyes to the clich s and stupidities being retailed by the filmmakers He is wrong too to say of my favorable review of The Negotiator that I overpraised it in a cringe making way I did indeed say it really hums along in the second sentence of an opening paragraph which if he had quoted it all would have destroyed his point I invite any Slate reader to examine my entire review and decide if it supports Weisberg s generalizations The technique of generalizing from an exception to the rule is an effective but not honorable journalistic practice If Weisberg will take a closer look he will find I have given negative reviews to most of the big budget blockbusters of recent years and that I review more foreign art documentary and indeed films like Pi and Taste of Cherry in a month than Slate does in a year Weisberg s technique is to selectively choose those titles from each critic that illustrate his point while remaining deliberately oblivious to reviews by the same critic that would weaken it The article works only if Slate readers take him at his word for example that Gene Siskel gave Armageddon a rave he did not And it is not fair to criticize Janet Maslin for praising Lethal Weapon 4 while suppressing the information that I for example disliked it because that would not help his case just as the information that Maslin disliked many of the other films he mentions would also not serve his thesis If you are going to criticize critics you have to be a better critic than he is in this essentially unresearched piece which is excellent only as an example of the off the top of the head thumb sucker genre Roger EbertChicago Sun Times Chicago Jacob Weisberg replies Readers can decide for themselves whether Ebert overpraises
