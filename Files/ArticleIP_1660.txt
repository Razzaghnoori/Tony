 Bring Me the Head of Saddam Hussein Iraq was Issue 1 as the Sunday pundits readied the country for war against Saddam Hussein As they did pundits on both the right Bill Kristol of ABC s This Week and the left Mara Liasson of Fox News Sunday asked why the commander in chief wasn t mobilizing public opinion for the coming clash No problem said all the president s persons who swarmed the weekend shows conducting well scripted teach ins about the dangers posed by Saddam and his biological weapons Last week s line was that Saddam s quarrel was with the United Nations not the United States but this week the emphasis shifted slightly to leave no doubt that the United States will settle the dispute unilaterally if need be The talking heads were a babble with bellicosity Form as big a posse as we can urged Mort Kondracke on The McLaughlin Group Juan Williams of Fox News Sunday predicted a cruise missile attack followed by hand to hand combat Clearly we ve got to strike the head said Sam Donaldson on This Week Saddam must go said Margaret Carlson on CNN s Capital Gang Extend the no fly zone said David Gergen Tighten the noose Contemplating Saddam s anthrax tipped warheads on NBC s Meet the Press Rush Limbaugh answered his own question when he asked should we wait until he does it or pre empt it Having cast their vote for assassinating Saddam last Sunday This Week s Kristol and George Stephanopoulos had no room to escalate So they offered sober military strategies If you go in it has to be a sustained bombing campaign and that has to be followed up by the threat of ground troops said Kristol The silver lining of the coming war Kristol smiled was that it NATO expansion and the troops in Bosnia would make 1998 a foreign policy year Having declared war the pundit posse immediately expressed doubt that it could be won Iraq absorbed 88 000 tons of bombs during the 43 days of the Gulf War without folding or replacing Saddam noted several pundits including Tim Russert on NBC s Meet the Press Saddam s bio chem arsenal was surely bunkered beyond the reach of U S bombs they concluded This Week s George Will pointed out that it took weeks to find Manuel Noriega in tiny Panama after the invasion Gen Norman Schwarzkopf agreed on Meet the Press that invaders would never apprehend Saddam but he still insisted that the United States bomb him into submission The end game of all the dictator s schemes is undermining U N authority and getting the sanctions lifted Schwarzkopf said Only by pulverizing Iraq could the United States deny Saddam these diplomatic victories and preserve the United Nations power to police rogue nations in the future The only AWOLs in the pundit battalion were Robert Novak on Capital Gang and John McLaughlin who suggested that we talk the Iraqis into compliance They were shouted down Accept Saddam as he is ventured Novak and make a deal Reintegrate Iraq into the world community offered McLaughlin who added that Iraq wasn t the only outsider nation with chemical and biological weapons National Security Adviser Sandy Berger called Saddam a weapons of mass destruction repeat offender Extending Berger s criminal justice metaphor Secretary of Defense William Cohen rejected Iraq s demand that Americans be excluded from the U N inspection team Saddam being a parolee is not in a position to determine who his parole officer will be Cohen also played show and tell on This Week holding up a 5 pound bag of Domino s sugar The same sized package containing anthrax could kill half of the inhabitants of Washington D C he warned The pundits tipped their hand on where the debate will go next week when they tried without much success to inject Israel into the debate The Arab League had aligned with Saddam said Gergen on The McLaughlin Group and others because it was angry with the United States for the stalled peace process All politics is personal was the commentariat s reading of President Clinton s failure to muster Democratic support for fast track trade legislation The defeat was payback Liasson Limbaugh and Mark Shields on Capital Gang by Old Democrats for New Democrat Clinton s sins of triangulation the balanced budget welfare reform the tax cuts They re not scared of him said Kristol It s beyond not being scared of him shot back This Week co host Cokie Roberts They re mad at him Reprising an earlier theme about Iraq Donaldson criticized the White House for not organizing a campaign far enough in advance to pass fast track Innuendos 97 Fox News Brit Hume claimed on Fox News Sunday that the word around town has it that the Department of Justice which has failed to nail even one of the million Democrats guilty of campaign finance violations is aggressively pursuing its investigation of former Republican National Committee chief Haley Barbour It looks terrible the Fox Washington bureau chief observed more in anger than in sorrow Pundit Bites Last week President Clinton claimed on Meet the Press that he hasn t eaten at McDonald s since becoming president Limbaugh countered that Clinton had in fact snarfed at Mickey D s in Hawaii If he ll lie about McDonald s he ll do it about Iraq
