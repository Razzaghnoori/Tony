 Background Modern drug discovery is concerned with identification and validation of novel protein targets from among the 30 000 genes postulated to be present in the human genome 1 In understanding the importance of any new gene and its connection to a given phenotype there is the need to know the immediate neighborhood of partners for each gene product since they are most likely involved in the action of the gene product In this regard there are few if any new chemical entities NCEs capable of regulating protein protein interactions as either agonists or antagonists In the past peptides have sometimes been used to obtain information about protein protein interactions as well as regulate their activity 2 3 This has most often been accomplished with libraries consisting of peptides between 15 amino acids in length Using this approach peptides have been identified which act as agonists and antagonists though in most cases these peptides have not shown any sequence homology to the natural ligand 4 5 6 Clearly these peptides did not use any of the natural amino acid contacts required for binding of the growth factors to their receptors As these peptides were functional but not compositional mimics they lacked primary sequence information useful for identifying by motif sequence identity or similarity the true biological partner These results are not surprising since the putative contact domains between receptors and hormones are expected to be conformational and short peptides were probably unable to mimic a large three dimensional shape In this report we describe a novel post genomic approach called Phenogenix that involves the use of complex and random peptide libraries of large size up to 40 amino acids and diversity 10 11independent clones per library in combination with computational analysis for garnering information on the natural biological partners and pathways 7 We also show that the specificity of these peptides can be improved by mutation at the DNA level that has implications for phenotyping and the development of Site Directed Assays Overall the data indicates that the surrogate peptides derived in this manner can contain sequence information regarding the natural contact domains for both protein protein and protein non protein interactions Results and Discussion Criteria for a Partner Hit The first stage in the computational analysis of our surrogates requires the alignment of the peptides into groups based on motifs or consensus regions In addition we examine each peptide for significant differences in the expected frequency of amino acids and the number of times a specific peptide sequence has been repeated After defining our query strategy e g entire surrogate sequence motifs etc we simultaneously search several public databases using programs such as Blastp MAST Motif Alignment and Search Tool and Patternfind see Materials and Methods The output from each search is further analyzed based on criteria described in Table 1 Homology between the partner and surrogate oftentimes ranges over a long stretch 15 20 amino acids or may be found in a perfect match within a short sequence of 5 8 amino acids unpublished data Other positive indicators include 1 the appearance of the partner in at least 50 of the top cohort i e first 10 matches of any one search 2 the appearance of the same or related hits occurring in several different searches 3 the identification of the same partner for multiple peptides from the same or related pans Criterion 2 addresses the biological relevance of a hit e g distribution disease indication etc and criterion 3 relates to the biological activity of the surrogate and its ability to cause a phenotypic change in the appropriate test system phenotyping Panning of mRNA targets In one series of experiments biotinylated oligonucleotides comprising the UTRs untranslated regions of four mRNAs were synthesized Table 2 The oligonucleotides were heat denatured and allowed to anneal at room temperature to allow the appropriate re folding All of the mRNAs were subjected to 4 rounds of panning using both 40 mer and 20 mer random libraries under similar but not equivalent conditions Individual phage clones from rounds three and four were amplified tested for binding to the specific and a non specific mRNA and sequenced Table 3shows the overall results that were obtained from each of the pannings On average about 8 of the surrogates were found to be specific for each target when compared to a control RNA RRE For each RNA target the predicted amino acid sequences of the peptide binders were analyzed in terms of both overall amino acid content and the occurrence of known RNA binding motifs and consensus domains Two motifs were observed for the APP and HCV RNAs Figure 1and see below RNA binding proteins are known to have an overall abundance of certain amino acid residues 8 9 Table 4shows a comparison of the specific amino acid composition of peptide binders with regard to their average frequency of occurrence seen within the original unpanned library All of the peptide binders showed enrichment of arginine residues as would be expected for RNA binding proteins Also tryptophan serine and glycine residues were enriched In addition several peptide binders showed the presence of the RGG box Figure 2A and one sequence was found that contained the KH motif Figure 2B both of which are known RNA binding motifs 8 9 The isolation of surrogates containing generic RNA binding motifs is not unexpected and probably results from enhanced binding and concomitant enrichment of these peptides during the panning process In addition an additional consensus motif was identified among peptides isolated by panning on RRE RNA 10 This motif K R LRRR aligns with a region on the expected natural partner the Rev peptide Figure 3 One peptide was chosen from each of the APP HCV and IGF pans based on the highest specific binding vs RRE RNA as templates for the construction of secondary libraries Each of these libraries contained 10 10independent clones and was used for panning the appropriate target RNA Results are shown in Figure 4and Table 5 Since library construction was based on peptides previously selected for binding and selectivity to specific RNAs the number of target specific clones increased dramatically following in vitro maturation In addition motifs were observed suggesting the critical nature of these specific residues in terms of binding to target Preliminary studies have shown that the secondary surrogates have higher relative affinities when compared to the original clones unpublished data In the case of the HCV RNA we panned a sequence AA UUG CCA GGA CGA CCG GGU CCU UUC UUG GAU CAA CCC GCU CAA UGC CUG GAG AUU predicted to bind to at least one of the proteins comprising the translation complex eukaryotic Initiation Factor 3 eIF3 11 12 13 14 Published reports identify the p120 subunit of eIF3 as the one binding to the apical loop of the domain III of HCV 5 UTR and p170 also called p160 as binding the stem portion of the domain III The oligonucleotide used for these studies contains the apical portion and part of the stem portion of domain III and therefore might bind one or both of these subunits Interestingly the binding of p170 p160 to the stem of domain III is position independent i e not constrained by other structural elements on the mRNA 12 13 Sequence analysis of surrogate peptide binders to HCV using MEME Motif Elicitation Program and other peptide sequence alignment programs identified a consensus sequence TxRLL found in four peptides binding to the HCV mRNA Figure 5 This motif was unique to HCV and not found in peptides derived from any of the other mRNA pans Interestingly the TxRLL containing surrogates were found by two investigators in the laboratory using the 20 mer or 40 mer random libraries under different experimental conditions Database searches using Patternfind at the ISREC server were performed using parameters appropriate for short protein queries and were successful in identifying a human gene product subunit p170 of eIF3 Figure 3 Searches using the consensus region as the query likewise identified sequence homology with the large subunit p170 of eIF3 These results fit our partner criteria 1 3 Table 1 Interestingly other amino acids in these surrogates were found to be identical to residues flanking the TxRLL motif in p170 on both the amino and carboxy sides Figure 5 Thus the library contained peptide surrogates binding to the HCV target mRNA as well as containing sequence information identifying the natural interacting partner and predicting the putative contact amino acids on the p170 subunit of eIF3 The fact that multiple surrogates had the TxRLL motif suggests that this region of p170 is necessary and critical for binding of HCV mRNA to eIF3 Panning of TNF In a separate study we panned the immune cytokine TNF lymphotoxin Lt 15 16 17 using a highly stringent protocol involving both positive vs TNF and negative vs TNF TNFR1 and TNFR2 selection One of these peptides designated KcB7 had the amino acid sequence RKEMGGGGGPGWSENLFQ A Blastp search using several different queries revealed TNFR1 which is the natural biological partner of TNF Figure 5 Interestingly the other cognate partner i e receptor TNFR2 was not identified Closer examination of the complementary sequences revealed that the short N terminal sequence RKEMG and the C terminal sequence WSENLFQ were identical to regions on TNFR1 amino acids 77 81 and 107 113 respectively Although not complete these segments corresponded to amino acids within two critical ligand receptor contact domains 18 In the case of the N terminal grouping the surrogate contained 5 of the 15 amino acids of the 77 81 contact domain whereas in the C terminal grouping the surrogate contained 6 of the 9 amino acids identified within the 107 113 contact domain It is also worth noting that on the receptor these two domains are not contiguous but are separated by 25 amino acids whereas only a 6 amino acid hydrophobic stretch separates the two noncontiguous contact mimicking domains in the surrogate Therefore the seven amino acid linker may provide the appropriate molecular distances needed for TNF binding to the receptor Robustness of the System The successful isolation of a useful surrogate may seem an improbable task especially in cases where nothing is known about the hotspot surface s on a target In reality biopanning using the RAPIDLIB library has allowed in 90 of cases the identification of partner specific peptides among the 10 10 11independent clones that are expressed within this library 7 19 20 and unpublished data More often than not between 10 and 100 different surrogates have been found for any one target panned and 75 of the targets gave rise to surrogates that bound to regulatory hotspots on the target 7 and unpublished data Several important facts are critical to the success of the process In the first place there must be a high degree of diversity within the library so that one surrogate can be found for each protein target Additionally It appears that panning seems to favor the enrichment of regulatory surrogates versus irrelevant peptides In our experience the large number of random peptides includes a broad sampling of linear and conformational protein surfaces sufficient to present at least one low affinity complement for any target s surface 19 20 The immune system s antibody repertoire arises through a process 21 22 23 24 similar to in some aspects to what occurs during the panning process Initially immunoglobulins are synthesized containing multiple small contact domains i e CDR or Complementarity Defining Regions to provide a rough complement of an antigen s surface Subsequently antibody antigen binding is improved via mutational events within the antibody genes to produce a complement with higher affinity and selectivity Biopanning works in an analogous manner by initially enriching for peptides with low affinity for a specific target However surrogates may only need to contain some amino acids identical to those on the partner to bind with sufficient avidity rather than affinity Other methods that have been used extensively for high throughput partner identification include the yeast two hybrid system 25 While the two hybrid approach is popular it has a number of inherent problems including a high potential for false positives the inability to use non protein targets such as mRNA or membrane bound extracellular proteins and the inability to address postranslational modifications on a target The generation of surrogates on the other hands is target independent and their utility for partner identification resides in the computational analysis of the peptide s sequence Since our libraries contain totally random peptides ranging from 20 and up to 40 amino acids in length there are no known restrictions on the amino acids that can be selected to create the surrogate s complementary surface 7 Thus the examples described in this report relate to the utility of the surrogate approach for finding the cognate receptor for both protein and non protein targets In the case of the surrogates for both HCV mRNA and TNF it is clear that the large diversity and size of the original library was in fact critical to their successful isolation since libraries of 20 amino acids would not have contained either the KcB7 peptide or the HCV specific surrogates In addition to the data presented in this paper we have screened other targets using this approach While the expected natural partners were found for many of the proteins there were instances where surrogates were generated but lacked partner information e g IGF 1R growth hormone receptor insulin receptor 7 and manuscripts in preparation There are several possible explanations for these results While our libraries are large and diverse it is probable that identification of a surrogate peptide with partner information is a rare event With that in mind it may require the isolation and sequencing of large numbers of clones perhaps 500 target in order to find the appropriate surrogate for partner identification On the other hand some targets may have complex or unusual protein protein contact sites that preclude generation of a surrogate with partner information Ongoing experiments will address both of these possibilities Surrogates have also been found to have the minimal structural content necessary to induce a pharmacological effect on any target in addition to their use in partner identification Most of our surrogates have been shown to have either agonist or antagonist activity in the appropriate biochemical and or biological models 7 manuscripts in preparation The surrogates were also able to subdivide large contact surfaces into smaller contact domains through which target activity can be modified 7 These attributes point to surrogate use in phenotyping and validating novel genes whose functions are unknown and for which no known partners exist Finally it is worthwhile to note that surrogates have been used to develop competitive Site Directed Assays SDAs for essential sub domains thereby allowing their use in high throughput screening of large combinatorial libraries of small molecules unpublished data In our experience almost all of the peptide surrogates isolated from these complex libraries by our various panning procedures bind to regulatory hot spots on varied targets This non random association between a surrogate and a target s pharmacologically active site assures a high degree of probability that once found surrogates will have utility for the rapid development of SDAs capable of identifying small molecules of pharmacological importance Conclusions The results of these experiments support the use of in vitro panning procedures with our highly complex and random 20 40 mer peptide libraries as a method to obtain information on large numbers of protein partners and enable the elucidation of biologically relevant protein networks This post genomic approach can be automated to increase the number of known and unknown genes and gene products that can be used as targets for partner identification as the first step in the drug discovery process Additionally the surrogates isolated in such studies would be prime candidates for phenotyping and target validation through their ability to regulate target activity and for identifying small molecule drug leads through their use in Site Directed Assays Overall the surrogates can be seen as providing a discovery continuum by bridging the gap between functional genomics and proteomics and modern drug discovery Materials and Methods Targets Oligonucleotides for the mRNA pans were synthesized by Dharmacon Research Lafayette CO and used for the

incubation The eluted phage are pooled neutralized with 100 l of 1 M Tris HCl pH 8 0 The eluted phage were then panned vs other members of the TNF family as a way to obtain peptides specific to the original target Subtractive panning For example phage initially panned vs TNF would be subsequently panned vs TNF TNFR1 and TNFR2 to remove peptides cross reacting with the other members After the final panning the phage are added to 10 ml of log phase E coli TG1 OD 600 1 0 and amplified in 2x YT glucose medium for one hour at 37 C Helper phage M13K07 and ampicillin are then added and the cells
