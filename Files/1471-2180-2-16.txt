 Background Yersinia pestis the causative agent of bubonic plague harbors a large virulence plasmid that is essential for pathogenicity This plasmid called pCD1 1 in Y pestis encodes for a type III secretion apparatus necessary for the translocation of effector proteins Yops into eukaryotic target cells 2 The net result of this polarized toxin translocation is the disruption of eukaryotic cell signalling and structure 2 Induction of the virulence related genes on pCD1 is linked to an in vitro phenomenon termed the Low Calcium Response LCR The LCR is believed to mimic the response of Y pestis in contact with eukaryotic cells when calcium ions are removed from the growth medium at 37 C The result of this in vitro induction of virulence genes is the massive secretion of Yops into the growth medium accompanied by a characteristic growth restriction that is a hallmark phenotype of the LCR 3 Secretion of Yops by the type III secretion system is not constitutive Control of secretion is complex and involves several proteins that positively and negatively regulate the activity of the secretion apparatus in response to environmental conditions 3 LcrG has been implicated in blocking the secretion apparatus either directly or indirectly 4 as strains lacking lcrG constitutively secrete Yops 5 regardless of inducing conditions In addition YopN TyeA SycN YscB LcrH YopD and LcrQ are all also required for the negative regulation of Yops secretion 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 LcrV the V antigen is thought to positively regulate Yops secretion as lcrV strains do not secrete Yops even under conditions that normally favor secretion 18 19 LcrG and LcrV have been demonstrated to physically interact in the bacterial cytoplasm 4 Disruption of the LcrG LcrV interaction or overexpression of LcrG in a low LcrV background both result in a constitutive blockage of Yops secretion 18 20 This evidence led to a model of how these two proteins may control Yops secretion The LcrG titration model theorizes that LcrG blocks the secretion apparatus Ysc from the bacterial cytoplasm and that interaction with LcrV is required to relieve the blockage Upon induction by eukaryotic cell contact or removal of calcium from the growth medium the intracellular level of LcrV becomes elevated relative to that of LcrG The increased amount of LcrV removes LcrG from its secretion blocking role resulting in full induction of the LCR and secretion of Yops Evidence accumulated to date clearly demonstrates that the LcrG LcrV interaction is critical for the regulation of this complex virulence system 18 20 Therefore dissection of the LcrG LcrV interaction is warranted Utilizing yeast two hybrid analyses we further investigated the LcrG LcrV interaction We determined that the N terminus of LcrG is essential for LcrV interaction The smallest linear region of LcrG required for the interaction is predicted to form a coiled coil motif a structure often associated with protein protein interactions We used both alanine scanning and a radical site directed mutagenesis strategy to identify amino acids critical for the interaction within this region of LcrG While alanine mutants failed to disrupt the LcrG LcrV interaction radical mutations of three residues revealed a region important for the interaction These residues are likely to reside on the same face of the protein if a coiled coil structure is assumed Based on this evidence we predict that the interaction of LcrG with LcrV occurs within an N terminal coiled coil domain of LcrG via hydrophobic interactions Additionally we investigated whether the Pseudomonas homolog of LcrG PcrG could transcomplement an lcrG strain of Y pestis The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa utilizes a type III secretion system for intracellular delivery of toxins 21 22 23 that is the most similar to the Yersinia system 21 Several components of the Pseudomonas system have been demonstrated to functionally complement genetic defects in the Yersinia homologs including the LcrV homolog PcrV 24 25 Homologs of LcrG and LcrV i e PcrG and PcrV have only been identified in P aeruginosa suggesting that this pair of regulatory proteins may fulfill similar roles in these extracellular pathogens In the present study we found that PcrG could not substitute for LcrG although both proteins interacted with LcrV This result led to a genetic selection for PcrG variants that could transcomplement an lcrG defect Isolation of a PcrG variant that could substitute for LcrG led to the identification of a region within LcrG that may be involved in blocking the activity of the Y pestis type III secretion system Results and Discussion Delineation of the LcrV interaction domain of LcrG LcrG and LcrV physically interact in Y pestis 4 and that interaction plays a significant role in the regulation of Yops secretion 20 LcrG and LcrV interact in a yeast two hybrid assay 20 therefore this technique was used to further investigate the region of LcrG required for its interaction with LcrV Truncations of LcrG were constructed and fused to the GAL4 activation domain of pACT2 These plasmids were co transformed into yeast strain Y187 with full length LcrV fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain of plasmid pAS2 1 to determine if the LcrG truncations could continue to participate in an interaction with LcrV Using a filter lift assay as a qualitative determination of an interaction and a liquid galactosidase assay to quantify the results we found that the LcrV interaction domain of LcrG lies in the N terminus of the protein The smallest linear region of LcrG that was still capable of interacting with LcrV was determined to be amino acids 7 40 Fig 1 shown highlighted in yellow in Fig 2 Deletion of five additional amino acids from the N terminus of the 7 40 construct or seven amino acids from the C terminus of the 7 40 construct eliminated our ability to detect an interaction using this system Fig 1 Interestingly this approximate region of LcrG amino acids 7 35 is predicted to form a coiled coil domain when LcrG is analyzed using the COILS algorithm 26 data not shown These results suggest that the LcrG LcrV interaction requires the N terminus of LcrG and may involve a coiled coil domain Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the LcrG N terminus To determine individual residues of LcrG required for interaction with LcrV a systematic site directed mutagenesis strategy was used to change conserved or charged residues within the delineated interaction region Initially alanine scanning mutagenesis was used for this study as alanine substitutions are generally thought to minimally effect protein folding 27 Sequence conservation from the alignment of LcrG with the Pseudomonas aeruginosa homolog PcrG Fig 2 allowed the targeting of specific residues likely to be important for the interaction After construction of specific missense mutants each full length LcrG alanine variant was screened for interaction with LcrV using the yeast two hybrid assay Surprisingly the alanine scanning mutagenesis results failed to demonstrate amino acids of LcrG involved in the LcrG LcrV interaction All of the alanine mutants screened were capable of interaction with LcrV as demonstrated in a filter lift assay Liquid galactosidase assays showed that the strength of the interactions were not significantly reduced from that of wild type LcrG Table 1 These results showed that single alanine substitutions are insufficient to disrupt the LcrG LcrV interaction A likely explanation for the failure of alanine scanning to reveal residues in LcrG important for LcrV interaction is that alanine is a residue capable of interaction with hydrophobic residues Our subsequent studies suggest that the interaction of LcrG with LcrV occurs at a hydrophobic patch within LcrG Radical site directed mutagenesis of LcrG allows the LcrG LcrV interaction to be disrupted Based on our experience with the alanine scanning combined with the similar results of Francis et al 28 it seemed likely that the LcrG LcrV interaction was occurring between hydrophobic residues Accordingly we continued to examine the interaction domain using a mutagenesis strategy described by Francis et al termed radical site directed mutagenesis 28 This method involves replacing hydrophobic residues with charged residues or changing charged residues to oppositely charged residues This method was used to mutagenize several conserved residues in the interacting region in the effort to disrupt the LcrG LcrV interaction Table 2 These radical site directed mutants were then screened using the yeast two hybrid system for their interaction with LcrV Radical mutagenesis revealed several residues with decreased galactosidase activity in the yeast two hybrid system The LcrG mutants A16R A16D S23R and L30R all had significantly decreased activity when assayed for galactosidase expression Table 2 LcrG mutants I20R A27E and I37R demonstrated somewhat decreased activity Table 2 These results suggested that residues A16 S23 and L30 red asterisks in Fig 2 all participate in the interaction of LcrG with LcrV and that residues I20 A27 and I37 may also contribute to the interaction Of the residues identified in these experiments only changes to A16 S23 and L30 were detected with a more sensitive filter lift assay for galactosidase activity and were therefore chosen for further characterization The alanine at position 16 was previously identified as a critical residue in the LcrG LcrV interaction 20 Two mutations were characterized at this position A16R and A16D and they failed to interact with LcrV showing that single substitutions of this kind can disrupt the LcrG LcrV interaction 20 Additional data from this study showed that a substitution of the leucine at position 30 with an arginine also prevented the LcrG LcrV interaction in yeast Table 2 Interestingly when L30 is replaced with alanine Table 1 or threonine Table 2 the interaction is not effected Mutagenesis of the serine at position 23 to arginine resulted in an LcrG variant that weakly interacted with LcrV as determined by a filter lift assay for galactosidase activity The color change of the yeast colonies due to the hydrolysis of 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl D galactopyranoside X gal by galactosidase was significantly delayed and less intense than the reaction we observed for strongly interacting mutants The liquid galactosidase assay confirmed that the strength of the LcrG S23R LcrV interaction was reduced Table 2 indicating that this residue is likely involved in the interaction of LcrG with LcrV As coiled coil motifs show a characteristic seven amino acid repeat pattern with each repeat representing two turns of the helix it is interesting that three positions identified as important to the LcrG LcrV interaction 16 23 and 30 are each separated by seven amino acids When this region was analyzed using a helical wheel projection the three residues fall on the same face of the helix which appears to be largely hydrophobic in nature Fig 3 These results and observations further indicate that the LcrG LcrV interaction may require the participation of a coiled coil motif and occurs at a largely hydrophobic interface To evaluate the biological significance of the changes in interaction seen in the yeast two hybrid system between LcrV and LcrG S23R or LcrG L30R LcrG S23R and L30R were expressed in lcrG Y pestis where their ability to control Yops secretion was examined Neither the S23R or the L30R mutant displayed the calcium independent growth phenotype previously observed for LcrG A16R 20 LcrG S23R displayed a wildtype growth and secretion phenotype while LcrG L30R was Ca 2 blind data not shown To further understand the phenotypes obtained the ability of LcrG S23R and L30R to interact with LcrV was examined in Y pestis Wild type LcrG LcrG S23R LcrG L30R and LcrG A16R were independently co expressed with His 6 tagged LcrV in a strain of Y pestis deleted for lcrGV The cells were French pressed and the cleared lysates were applied to Talon columns to purify His 6 tagged LcrV As previously reported 20 LcrG copurified with LcrV and LcrG A16R did not copurify with LcrV Fig 4 lanes 3 and 12 When LcrG S23R was coexpressed with His 6 tagged LcrV a small amount was recovered in the elution fraction from the column Fig 4 lane 6 This result is indicative of a weaker interaction between LcrG S23R and LcrV than the interaction between wildtype LcrG and LcrV The weaker interaction seen in Y pestis between LcrG S23R and LcrV corresponds with our yeast two hybrid data for the S23R mutant which showed an interaction with LcrV and suggests an interaction with decreased affinity Table 2 The interaction results for LcrG S23R provide an explanation for the failure of LcrG S23R to confer a Ca 2 independent phenotype like the previously described LcrG A16R mutant LcrG S23R still interacts with LcrV and therefore LcrV can neutralize the LcrG mediated secretion block In fact this result is consistent with the fact that very low levels of LcrG are required to provide LcrG function 20 LcrG L30R either interacts weakly with or does not interact with His 6 tagged LcrV in Y pestis Fig 4 lane 9 This result also corresponds with the lack of interaction observed in the yeast two hybrid assay for this mutant Taken together these results suggest that the residues found to be involved in the LcrG LcrV interaction using two hybrid analysis are relevant in the bacterial cell However the inability of L30R to function like our previously described A16R mutant was somewhat surprising One explanation is that the protein with the L30R change is simply misfolded The second explanation is that the secretion blocking and the LcrV interaction domains of LcrG overlap Currently we do not possess the data required to differentiate between the two possibilities and we are pursuing the reasons for the failure of L30R to function like wildtype LcrG PcrG does not complement an lcrGstrain but interacts with LcrV Because the residues of LcrG required for interaction with LcrV are strongly conserved in PcrG of P aeruginosa red asterisks in Fig 2 we determined if PcrG could interact directly with LcrV First PcrG GAL4 AD and LcrV GAL4 BD chimeras were coexpressed in a yeast two hybrid assay Activation of galactosidase by the chimeric proteins was demonstrated by a filter lift assay showing that LcrV and PcrG interact data not shown To determine if PcrG and LcrV also interacted in Y pestis we attempted to copurify the two proteins from bacterial extracts PcrG and His 6 LcrV were coexpressed in a Y pestis strain with lcrG and lcrV deleted and the cleared lysates were applied to a Talon column PcrG reacts weakly with antibody to LcrG allowing us to detect the presence of PcrG on immunoblots PcrG was present in the elution fraction Fig 5A lane 6 indicating that PcrG was retained on the Talon column This result demonstrated that PcrG and LcrV interact in Y pestis The interaction of PcrG with LcrV supports the mutagenesis and sequence data indicating that residues conserved between LcrG and PcrG are likely to be important for interaction with LcrV Since PcrG and LcrV interacted in Y pestis the ability of PcrG to complement an lcrG strain of Y pestis was examined Cultures of lcrG strains transcomplemented with either LcrG or PcrG were grown in the presence and absence of calcium and harvested after four hours of growth at 37 C Culture supernatants were examined for the presence of secreted proteins by immunoblotting for LcrV YopE and YopM Fig 5Bshows that LcrG expression blocked secretion in this strain in the presence of calcium and allowed secretion in its absence Fig 5B lanes 3 and 4 However when PcrG was expressed secretion was not blocked in either the presence or absence of calcium calcium blind phenotype similar to the parent strain Fig 5B lanes 5 and 6 Therefore while PcrG is capable of interacting with LcrV it differs from LcrG in its ability to block secretion of Yops in Y pestis Selection of PcrG mutants that block secretion PcrG of P aeruginosa can interact with LcrV but cannot block secretion of Yops in Y pestis Fig 5B This result suggested that mutagenesis of pcrG could be used to isolate PcrG mutants capable of blocking Yops secretion in Y pestis This genetic screen allowed the isolation of PcrG mutants that functioned in Y pestis in a manner indistinguishable from LcrG Fig 5B compare lanes 7 and 8 to lanes 3 and 4 DNA sequencing of seven independent isolates revealed the presence of a phenylalanine to leucine change at position 42 of PcrG in all seven of the isolates This result suggests that a region of PcrG including amino acid 42 is capable of interaction with Y pestis secretion components and suggests that the homologous LcrG region is likely to be involved in LcrG s secretion blocking activity Analysis of the putative secretion blocking region of LcrG Change of residue 42 in PcrG from phenylalanine to leucine made the PcrG sequence look more like that of LcrG That is position 42 of PcrG became identical to the corresponding LcrG residue L39 Fig 2 boxed residues This information suggested that residue 39 of LcrG was an ideal candidate for site directed mutagenesis to disrupt LcrG s secretion blocking activity Accordingly the leucine at position 39 in LcrG was mutated to both phenylalanine and arginine Surprisingly neither mutant LcrG protein L39F data not shown or L39R Fig 6B lanes 5 and 6 effected LcrG function Subsequent mutagenesis of the phenylalanine at position 48 of LcrG to arginine resulted in an LcrG mutant F48R blue asterisk in Fig 2 that was defective for secretion blocking activity Fig 6B lanes 7 and 8 Mutation of F48 to either alanine or leucine had no effect on the function of those LcrG variants suggesting that the hydrophobic nature of F48 is important for LcrG function The expression level of LcrG and LcrG F48R from our plasmid constructs were also analyzed in whole cell extracts LcrG F48R was expressed as well as wild type LcrG demonstrating that its inability to block secretion is not due to a change in the expression or stability of the protein Fig 6A lanes 3 4 and 7 8 An interesting point to note is that when Skrzypek and Straley deleted residues 39 53 of LcrG highlighted in blue in Fig 2 they obtained a mutant protein that did not block Yops secretion 5 The LcrG F48R mutant like the 39 53 mutant interacts with LcrV data not shown and 4 demonstrating that the protein likely folds in a native conformation Additionally the mutant confirms previous work that the two known LcrG functions secretion blocking and LcrV interaction are genetically separable 5 Further experiments will more precisely delineate the region of LcrG required to block the type III secretion apparatus Conclusions The interaction of LcrG with LcrV is a critical factor in controlling the activity of the type III secretion system in Y pestis 20 In order to gain a deeper understanding of this critical interaction we determined the region of LcrG required for interaction with LcrV Results presented in this study demonstrate that the smallest linear region of LcrG required for interaction with LcrV is residues 7 to 40 highlighted in yellow in Fig 2 Interestingly this region is predicted to form a coiled coil domain We have identified several residues indicated with red asterisks in Fig 2 within the interacting region of LcrG that contribute to the interaction with LcrV When residues 7 to 40 of the protein are analyzed with a helical wheel projection these three residues A16 S23 and L30 appear to lie on one face of an amphipathic helix Fig 3 The seven amino acid periodicity of the residues is consistent with a coiled coil protein motif These data strongly suggest the LcrV interaction domain of LcrG is contained within an amphipathic coiled coil domain Additionally we exploited the inability of PcrG to block secretion in Y pestis as a point to start mapping the region of LcrG required for blocking the type III secretion apparatus We found that mutation of residue 42 in PcrG boxed in Fig 2 allowed the protein to function in Y pestis This information coupled with a previous observation that deletion of residues 39 to 53 within LcrG highlighted in blue in Fig 2 abolished the secretion blocking activity 5 allowed us to identify amino acid 48 as a residue blue asterisk in
