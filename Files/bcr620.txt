 Introduction Breast cancer is a major cause of death among women in the United States and worldwide 1 While cures are probable if the cancer is detected early and remains localized many patients will succumb to the disease if the primary tumor metastasizes to secondary organs Although significant progress has been made in detecting and treating the primary tumor the ability to predict the metastatic behavior of a patient s tumor and to eradicate or control recurrent disseminated malignancy remain major clinical challenges in oncology We have previously characterized an experimental system that enables comparative molecular screening and functional evaluation of candidate breast metastasis related genes in an isogenic background 2 Two independent clones of opposing metastatic phenotype were derived from the MDA MB 435 breast tumor cell line metasatic M 4A4 and nonmetastatic NM 2C5 cell lines When inoculated into the mammary fat pad of athymic mice both cell lines form primary tumors While clone M 4A4 aggressively metastasizes to the lung and lymph nodes the NM 2C5 clone is entirely nonmetastatic Initial comparative gene expression analysis of the two clones revealed the secreted integrin binding protein osteopontin OPN 3 to be significantly increased in the metastatic M 4A4 cell line Conversely the expression of thrombospondin 1 TSP 1 4 and of tyrosinase related protein 1 TYRP 1 was markedly overexpressed in the nonmetastatic NM 2C5 cell line 2 5 OPN is a secreted glycophosphoprotein expressed by a number of cell types including leukocytes and epithelial lineages and it has been implicated biologically in bone development in immune system regulation 6 and in multiple mechanisms through signal transduction via its binding to integrins 7 OPN has been detected in primary breast tumors and is elevated in the plasma of patients with metastatic breast cancer 8 9 but an association between elevated levels of primary tumor OPN and metastatic burden has not been well established TSP 1 is a homotrimeric multidomain glycoprotein synthesized and secreted by numerous cell types including platelets vascular smooth muscle cells and keratinocytes 4 Due to its interaction with a wide variety of proteins TSP 1 has been implicated in a number of biological processes including coagulation cell adhesion the modulation of cell cell and cell matrix interactions control of tumor growth and metastasis and angiogenesis 10 Inhibition of tumor cell proliferation has been achieved in vivo by systemic treatment with TSP 1 peptide mimetics 11 but a correlation between primary tumor TSP 1 expression and poor prognosis has not been clearly established 12 While there are reports that these molecules can originate from tumor cells 13 the majority of reports have suggested that the major source of both TSP 1 and OPN is tumor associated stroma 14 or infiltrating macrophages and lymphocytes 15 The melanogenic enzymes TYRP 1 and TYRP 2 are well characterized differentiation antigens recognized by antibodies and T cells of patients with melanoma 16 The evaluation of TYRP 1 expression in human breast lesions has not been documented to date The aim of the present work was to examine the cellular distribution of OPN of TSP 1 and of TYRP 1 in human breast tissue and to determine whether the relative expression level of these three genes was associated with malignancy or breast tumor metastasis To overcome the problem of heterogeneity and stromal cell contamination in homogenized tissue specimens specific cell types were isolated by laser capture microdissection LCM prior to analysis We used a combination of immunohistochemistry IHC LCM and real time quantitative PCR qPCR analysis of material obtained from a panel of primary breast infiltrating ductal carcinomas and nodal metastases and compared the target gene expression levels with those found in nonmalignant diseased tissue and in samples of normal breast tissue Materials and methods Tissue samples Sixty eight frozen human breast tissue specimens were evaluated by LCM qPCR and IHC including 31 primary tumors of infiltrating ductal carcinomas 22 primary tumors with metastasis and nine primary tumors without known metastasis 22 matched nodal metastases 10 fibroadenomas and five normal breast tissues obtained from reduction mammoplasty In addition eight tumor associated stromal components including fibroblasts endothelial cells and inflammatory cells were microdissected from primary tumors without known metastases for analysis Breast tissues were obtained from surgical specimens at the John Radcliffe Hospital Oxford UK and at the UCSD Medical Center Samples were obtained in random order from the residue of tissue used for pathological diagnosis that would otherwise have been discarded Tissues were snap frozen immediately after resection and were stored in liquid nitrogen until analysis Four pairs of additional formalin fixed paraffin embedded FFPE specimens of primary infiltrating ductal carcinomas and of matched nodal metastasis were also used for IHC only total of 76 samples for IHC Histological diagnosis of all samples was performed

San Diego CA USA Comparison of numerical data was achieved using a two tailed unpaired t test P 0 05 was considered significant Results Immunohistochemical detection of OPN TSP 1 and TYRP 1 in human breast tissues The efficacy and specificity of OPN TSP 1 and TYRP 1 antibodies in IHC was tested by analysis of frozen tissue xenografts of known target gene expression 2 5 Positive cytoplasmic staining was detected with the OPN antibody in nine of 26 35 primary breast carcinomas with nodal metastases A representative example is depicted in Figure 1 Six of 26 23 metastatic tissue samples and five of nine 56 primary tumors without metastases were OPN positive Incubation of fibroadenoma and normal breast tissue specimens with the OPN antibody also produced positive staining in the epithelial cells of 53 of nonmalignant cases five fibroadenomas and three normal breast tissues OPN was also regularly observed in tumor infiltrating inflammatory cells and macrophages Fig 1 Although difficult to quantitate a trend of OPN localization towards the epithelial layer but not the myoepithelial layer was observed in normal breast tissue Fig 1 Overall the degree and intensity of OPN expression was qualitatively equal in samples of adenomas adenocarcinomas and nodal metastases from patients with disseminated disease The majority of primary carcinomas 66 that were positive for OPN also had concurrent OPN positive metastases IHC staining of breast tissue sections revealed intracytoplasmic staining of TSP 1 in six of 26 19 node positive primary carcinomas and in 10 of 26 38 metastases In this case all positive primaries had positive associated metastases although some metastatic tumors with positive TSP 1 expression had negative TSP 1 stain in their primary tumors TSP 1 staining was positive in two of nine primary carcinomas without metastases 22 Very weak staining was observed in fibroadenoma and normal tissues and no TSP 1 was detected in breast tissue stromal components A high percentage of node positive primary tumors 73 metastatic carcinomas 73 and 100 concordance between primary tumor and associated metastasis respectively primary carcinomas without metastases 89 benign breast specimens 70 and normal 60 breast specimens were positive for TYRP 1 staining Fig 1 TYRP 1 staining was confined to the cytoplasm and to the epithelial components of the tissue The staining achieved with all three antibodies was relatively homogeneous across the tumor in positive cases and no qualitative differences in staining were apparent at the invasive edge of the carcinomas No correlation was found between protein expression and tumor grade in the infiltrating ductal carcinomas and no consistent qualitative differences were revealed between primary tissues with or without associated metastases LCM and qPCR analysis of breast tissues While providing information on the cellular distribution of target gene expression the technique of one color chromogenic IHC staining can result in highly variable data across samples and it relies on visual scoring that is relatively subjective To obtain accurate quantitative information on target gene expression we employed qPCR technology The selection of specific cell types from the heterogeneous cellular composition of the tissue specimens was attained by LCM This procedure allowed OPN TSP 1 and TYRP 1 mRNA analysis in specific cells of interest in each case eliminating the contribution from normal adjacent cells that could cause difficulties in interpretation The cells of interest in the majority of cases were those of epithelial origin but eight specimens were also used for the isolation of tumor associated stroma fibroblast endothelial and inflammatory cells for comparison We measured the expression levels of the OPN TSP 1 and TYRP 1 genes using a quantitative PCR assay RT qPCR This analysis in line with the findings of the IHC data confirms that breast tumor cells themselves synthesize OPN TSP 1 and TYRP 1 in addition to tumor infiltrating macrophages in the case of OPN Normal and nonmalignant breast epithelia and stromal elements expressed reduced levels of OPN and TYRP 1 transcripts Figures 2 3 4demonstrate the differential expression pattern and the quantitative expression level of each of the three genes in human breast tissues Relative to the GAPDH transcript levels OPN expression was found to be 10 fold higher than TYRP 1 expression in all tissues examined TSP 1 expression was comparable with that of TYRP 1 in malignant cells but was at the limit of detection in normal and benign epithelia and stromal components OPN mRNA was found to be present in all microdissected tissue samples examined Significantly elevated 5 fold levels of OPN transcripts were observed in cells of epithelial origin dissected from primary carcinomas and associated metastases over nonmalignant cell sources All primary tumors combined P 0 017 and all metastases P 0 0082 exhibited significantly elevated OPN expression compared with normal epithelia Fig 2 However there was no difference in OPN expression between primary carcinomas with metastases and those without metastases Nor was there a quantitative difference in OPN expression between primary carcinomas and matched metastases Fig 2 While trace amounts were detected due to the sensitivity of PCR amplification thrombospondin transcripts were essentially absent from breast tissue epithelia obtained from normal and benign specimens and there were no appreciable levels detected in stromal tissue components However TSP 1 levels were significantly raised in malignant tissue epithelial sources Fig 3 TSP 1 levels were significantly higher 10 fold in all primary tumors P 0 0017 and in all metastases P 0 0001 over normal breast epithelia In line with the OPN patterns of expression there was no significant difference in TSP 1 levels between primary tumors with or without metastases nor between primary carcinomas and associated metastases TYRP 1 expression was higher than that of TSP 1 but lower than that of OPN 10 fold to 50 fold While TYRP 1 transcripts could be detected in all tissues examined Fig 4 including malignant and nonmalignant sources there were no significant quantitative differences revealed between the types of tissue Discussion A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in metastatic spread is needed to facilitate advances in prognostic evaluation for individual patients and in the design of therapeutic interventions to inhibit the process In an effort to establish a methodological framework for analysis of the molecules and the mechanisms involved in this complex multistep process we previously developed a well defined experimental system in which the role of candidate genes can be screened and tested 2 By serial dilution cloning of the MDA MB 435 tumor cell line and screening by orthotopic implantation into the mammary fat pad of athymic mice we derived a pair of breast tumor cell lines M 4A4 and NM 2C5 that originate from the same breast tumor but that have diametrically opposite metastatic capabilities Through multiple molecular analyses we have identified and verified a number of genes whose expression correlates with the metastatic phenotype in this xenograft model The expression of the proteins TSP 1 and TYRP 1 were found to correlate with the nonmetastatic phenotype whereas OPN was significantly elevated in the metastatic counterpart These findings prompted us to investigate the occurrence and distribution of these molecules in human breast tissues The investigative approach was designed to detect and quantify the three molecules in specific breast tissue components data that were not previously available Having detected all three proteins immunohistochemically in normal benign and malignant breast epithelia the quantitation of OPN TSP 1 and TYRP 1 mRNA was achieved using LCM and qPCR This technique allows for the accurate procurement of cells from specific microscopic regions of tissue sections and therefore enables the molecular genetic analysis of pure populations of malignant breast cells in their native tissue environment 18 This technical advance helps one to avoid the variation and subjectivity associated with IHC and to overcome the limitations of data interpretation caused by tissue heterogeneity and normal stromal cell contamination in homogenized tissue specimens Coupled with qPCR LCM can reveal significant differences in specific gene expression that are not accessible with relatively insensitive IHC alone We have demonstrated that human breast epithelia can themselves synthesize OPN and to a lesser extent TSP 1 and TYRP 1 in vivo and that elevated OPN and TSP 1 levels are indicative of malignancy Significant OPN expression has been reported in a number of breast epithelial cell lines 19 20 and so it is known that cells of breast epithelial origin can synthesize OPN in certain conditions But it is possible that in vitro OPN expression is a phenomenon of cell culture or that OPN positive cells have a selective growth advantage during extended passage Synthesis of OPN was also observed in infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages a factor that would seriously compromise efforts to quantify OPN in homogenized tissue specimens Such analysis would highlight tumors with a high level of infiltrating inflammatory cells rather than evaluate the levels of the marker molecule s in the proliferative epithelia of a lesion As observed in IHC tumor infiltrating inflammatory cells were presumably the stromal source of OPN Transcript levels in normal and fibroadenoma epithelia were equal to those found in isolated stroma indicating that the scattered infiltrating macrophages not lymphocytes have relatively high OPN expression The presence of inflammatory infiltration is a serious problem in the molecular analysis of tissue samples if the tissue is homogenized prior to analysis The presence of OPN in inflammatory cells highlights the advantage of microdissection in this analytical context High levels of OPN in breast tumor cell lines appear to correlate with a more aggressive in vivo phenotype 2 20 Transfection of OPN expression constructs into cells producing noninvasive mammary epithelial tumors has been reported to convert them to a malignant phenotype 8 21 Furthermore transfection of antisense OPN constructs or OPN targeting ribozymes into transformed tumorigenic cells can result in impaired anchorage independent growth as well as in diminished tumor forming ability in vivo 22 23 OPN is also typically overexpressed in human tumors including breast cancer 15 24 However the source of OPN in primary breast tumors was originally thought to be infiltrating macrophages rather than tumor cells themselves 15 By applying in situ hybridization Tuck and colleagues identified breast tumor cells as a source of OPN 13 Using a semiquantitative scoring system to evaluate immunohistochemical staining these investigators found a correlation between OPN positivity defined as 33 of tumor cells in a section staining for OPN in lymph node negative primary breast carcinomas and patient survival suggesting that tumor cells with elevated OPN levels may behave differently with regard to disease progression 13 Another recent study showed immunohistochemically that while OPN protein is expressed weakly in normal breast tissue OPN is expressed strongly 50 tumor cell staining in pregnant lactating tissue and in the majority 66 of breast carcinomas These investigators also found that the presence of OPN on tumor cells is correlated with patient demise 25 Our LCM mediated transcript detection acts as an important confirmation of breast tumor cell OPN synthesis because IHC analysis does not rule out the possibility that secreted proteins such as OPN and TSP 1 are sequestered by the tumor cells from the local environment Experiments with cell lines show that tumor cells can bind soluble OPN and can migrate towards an OPN concentration gradient 8 19 sequestration from the extracellular matrix in vivo is thus pertinent In the present study the epithelial layer appeared to express more OPN than the myoepithelial cells suggesting some OPN accumulation or induction via the myoepithelial layer or via stromal interactions Unfortunately the resolution of LCM does not enable the selection of epithelial cells from myoepithelial cells and so we were unable to confirm this quantitatively The effect of TSP 1 expression on tumor growth and metastasis has been examined in vivo by orthotopic inoculation of TSP 1 overexpressing MDA MB 435 cells A dose dependent inhibition of spontaneous pulmonary metastases was reported but this was paralleled by an inhibition of primary tumor growth 26 TSP 1 has also been implicated in the phenomenon of concomitant tumor resistance This refers to the ability of some large primary tumors to hold smaller distant tumors in check preventing their progressive growth Volpert and colleagues demonstrated this phenomenon using tumors formed by the human fibrosarcoma line HT1080 in nude mice and obtained data indicating that it was caused by secretion of TSP 1 by the primary tumor 27 Some of the properties attributed to TSP 1 are conflicting however TSP 1 can be both adhesive and anti adhesive in vitro can stimulate or inhibit angiogenesis and can inhibit or enhance proteolytic enzyme activity The composition of the matrix the availability of cytokines and proteases and the expression of various receptors in a given cellular environment might explain these opposing functions Our findings in the MDA MB 435 metastasis model are in agreement with TSP 1 playing a role in the reduction of metastatic potential 2 Clinically TSP 1 expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade and survival rate in a number of cancers 28 29 most probably because of the anti angiogenic effect of TSP 1 A recent study confirms this to be the case in breast cancer where expression of TSP 1 in stroma adjacent to ductal carcinoma in situ is lost in cases with more aggressive histological features 30 There are also reports however that fibroblast TSP 1 can induce matrix metalloproteinase 9 in breast tumor cells and gastric cancer tumor cells and this in turn may lead to a more invasive phenotype 14 31 In the present study TSP 1 was not expressed differentially in the stroma of benign tissue specimens or malignant tissue specimens nor in the epithelial component of breast tumors with or without metastases The increased levels observed in malignant breast epithelia suggest a shift in the balance between the anti angiogenic and proinvasive effects of TSP 1 during tumor progression The precise biological role of TSP 1 in human tumor progression awaits more definitive study In the present study TYRP 1 mRNA was present but at very low levels in breast tumor tissue in associated stroma and in normal breast tissues However IHC reveals that TYRP 1 protein staining is easily detectable in many samples The melanogenic enzymes tyrosinase TYRP 1 and TYRP 2 are well characterized differentiation antigens recognized by antibodies and T cells of patients with melanoma TYRP 1 is a type I membrane protein expressed by melanomas and normal melanocytes that was originally characterized as an oxidase in the melanin biosynthetic pathway Clinically TYRP 1 is thought to be important as a melanoma antigen that is highly antigenic to cytotoxic T cells providing a potential target for melanoma vaccine development 16 TYRP 1 appears to be less expressed in advanced primary lesions and metastases of human cutaneous melanoma and uveal melanoma 32 Primary melanoma samples express TYRP 1 transcripts at higher levels than melanoma metastases 33 and IHC analysis of malignant melanocytic lesions has shown that the invasive cells of primary melanomas are TYRP 1 negative 34 Our finding that TYRP 1 is also expressed in the poorly metastatic or noninvasive cell lines NM 2C5 2 T47D MCF7 and DU145 5 which are derived from human breast cancers and prostate tumors that are nonmetastatic indicates that this molecule is not exclusively expressed in cells of the melanocytic lineage It has long been known that the sera of patients who suffer from melanoma or mammary carcinoma show higher tyrosinase activity than normal sera 35 but to our knowledge this is the first report of TYRP 1 expression in human breast duct epithelium The biological function of and any clinical significance of TYRP 1 expression in normal or malignant breast carcinomas are presently unknown Conclusion We have quantitatively analyzed transcripts of OPN of TSP 1 and of TYRP 1 in microdissected human breast tissues Elevated levels of OPN and TSP 1 expression in primary and metastatic carcinomas suggest that these genes may be necessary for but not sufficient for dissemination Tumor cells that synthesize matrix associated factors such as OPN and TSP 1 may increase their ability to independently manipulate their surroundings encouraging invasion and migration These studies suggest that the quantitative analyses of OPN and or TSP 1 may be clinically useful in identifying malignant lesions over benign lesions but they are not as yet promising
