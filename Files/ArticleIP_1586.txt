 The Drug War The News produced for Friends of Phil Gramm by Alex Castellanos of National Media Windows or Mac download time 19 minutes at 14 4K for sound only The News Texas Sen Phil Gramm s swipe at Democratic opponent Victor Morales is a standard comparative ad in three chapters Problem Good Guy and Bad Guy It opens with a favorite image from the 1996 political season a black and white close up of a bag of drugs The narration implies that the reason kids are using drugs is that we re not tough on pushers who get just a slap on the wrist Valid or not the view mirrors opinion polls The language of the ad is pretested and this initial argument will encounter little voter resistance A subsequent image a slow fade on a group of schoolkids an American flag behind them is a powerful one It tells us visually that the America we want is fading away Next we see the Good Guy Phil Gramm He s depicted in a photograph not on film During the presidential primaries ad tests showed that voters reacted negatively to Gramm speaking So here he is smiling but in the safety of a still image A shot of a congressional bill and a blowup quote provide symbolic third party verification that the senator has a plan to get tough on pushers Gramm s picture promptly disappears but its brief presence qualifies the ad for the more lenient federal rules about candidate spots Such spots can t be censored and the stations must sell the time at a lower political rate Gramm maintains a presence in the spot via a chyron text on the screen The Gramm Plan This plan consists in part of a 10 year sentence with no parole for pushers another pretested winner in polls The second element of the plan life sentences for pushers who exploit kids strikes another responsive chord by raising the specter of molestation The Gramm Plan is accompanied by color film of prisoners behind bars Why color Because in this spot putting more offenders in jail is a happy result The News now cuts to a film clip of Morales a schoolteacher who won a stunning upset victory in the Democratic primary The clip cleverly gives the impression that Morales is actually saying what s written on screen and sourced to a local paper that he opposes longer sentences as a deterrent against crime The spot nails him as an opponent of Gramm s get tough approach as a liberal softy The red background complements the negative text and images Ironically the spot concludes by riffing on the slogan long used by liberal Sen Howard Metzenbaum and adopted by Michael Dukakis in 1988 Who s on your side The strategy here to invite voters to judge on the basis of social not economic issues The News attempts to set the campaign agenda How can the underfunded Morales expect to raise issues such as Medicare jobs or education in his spots when he s tied down defending himself against the Gramm blitz The News echoes and reinforces the message in Bob Dole s ads and speeches Democrats are weak on drugs No accident there The News was produced by Alex Castellanos one of the new members of Dole s media team Robert Shrum
