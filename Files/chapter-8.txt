 THE SYSTEM WAS BLINKING RED THE SUMMER OF THREAT As 2001 began counterterrorism officials were receiving frequent but fragmentary reports about threats Indeed there appeared to be possible threats almost everywhere the United States had interests including at home To understand how the escalation in threat reporting was handled in the summer of 2001 it is useful to understand how threat information in general is collected and conveyed Information is collected through several methods including signals intelligence and interviews of human sources and gathered into intelligence reports Depending on the source and nature of the reporting these reports may be highly classified and therefore tightly held or less sensitive and widely disseminated to state and local law enforcement agencies Threat reporting must be disseminated either through individual reports or through threat advisories Such advisories intended to alert their recipients may address a specific threat or be a general warning Because the amount of reporting is so voluminous only a select fraction can be chosen for briefing the president and senior officials During 2001 Director of Central Intelligence GeorgeTenet was briefed regularly regarding threats and other operational information relating to Usama Bin Ladin He in turn met daily with President Bush who was briefed by the CIA through what is known as the President s Daily Brief PDB Each PDB consists of a series of six to eight relatively short articles or briefs covering a broad array of topics CIA staff decides which subjects are the most important on any given day There were more than 40 intelligence articles in the PDBs from January 20 to September 10 2001 that related to Bin Ladin The PDB is considered highly sensitive and is distributed to only a handful of high level officials The Senior Executive Intelligence Brief SEIB distributed to a broader group of officials has a similar format and generally covers the same subjects as the PDB It usually contains less information so as to protect sources and methods Like their predecessors the Attorney General the FBI Director and Richard Clarke the National Security Council NSC counterterrorism coordinator all received the SEIB not the PDB Clarke and his staff had extensive access to terrorism reporting but they did not have access to internal nondisseminated information at the National Security Agency NSA CIA or FBI The Drumbeat Begins In the spring of 2001 the level of reporting on terrorist threats and planned attacks increased dramatically to its highest level since the millennium alert At the end of March the intelligence community disseminated a terrorist threat advisory indicating a heightened threat of Sunni extremist terrorist attacks against U S facilities personnel and other interests On March 23 in connection with discussions about possibly reopening Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House Clarke warned National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice that domestic or foreign terrorists might use a truck bomb their weapon of choice on Pennsylvania Avenue That would result he said in the destruction of the West Wing and parts of the residence 5 He also told her that he thought there were terrorist cells within the United States including al Qaeda The next week Rice was briefed on the activities of Abu Zubaydah and on CIA efforts to locate him As pointed out in chapter 6 Abu Zubaydah had been a major figure in the millennium plots Over the next few weeks the CIA repeatedly issued warnings including calls from DCI Tenet to Clarke that Abu Zubaydah was planning an operation in the near future One report cited a source indicating that Abu Zubaydah was planning an attack in a country that CIA analysts thought might be Israel or perhaps Saudi Arabia or India Clarke relayed these reports to Rice In response to these threats the FBI sent a message to all its field offices on April 13 summarizing reporting to date It asked the offices to task all resources including human sources and electronic databases for any information pertaining to current operational activities relating to Sunni extremism It did not suggest that there was a domestic threat The interagency Counterterrorism Security Group CSG that Clarke chaired discussed the Abu Zubaydah reports on April 19 The next day a briefing to top officials reported Bin Ladin planning multiple operations When the deputies discussed al Qaeda policy on April 30 they began with a briefing on the threat In May 2001 the drumbeat of reporting grew louder with reports to top officials that Bin Ladin public profile may presage attack and Bin Ladin network s plans advancing In early May a walk in to the FBI claimed there was a plan to launch attacks on London Boston and New York Attorney General John Ashcroft was briefed by the CIA on May 15 regarding al Qaeda generally and the current threat reporting specifically The next day brought a report that a phone call to a U S embassy had warned that Bin Ladin supporters were planning an attack in the United States using high explosives On May 17 based on the previous day s report the first item on the CSG s agenda was UBL Operation Planned in U S The anonymous caller s tip could not be corroborated Late May brought reports of a possible hostage plot against Americans abroad to force the release of prisoners including Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman the Blind Sheikh who was serving a life sentence for his role in the 1993 plot to blow up sites in New York City The reporting noted that operatives might opt to hijack an aircraft or storm a U S embassy This report led to a Federal Aviation Administration FAA information circular to airlines noting the potential for an airline hijacking to free terrorists incarcerated in the United States Other reporting mentioned that Abu Zubaydah was planning an attack possibly against Israel and expected to carry out several more if things went well On May 24 alone counterterrorism officials grappled with reports alleging plots in Yemen and Italy as well as a report about a cell in Canada that an anonymous caller had claimed might be planning an attack against the United States Reports similar to many of these were made available to President Bush in morning intelligence briefings with DCI Tenet usually attended by Vice President Dick Cheney and National Security Advisor Rice While these briefings discussed general threats to attack America and American interests the specific threats mentioned in these briefings were all overseas On May 29 Clarke suggested that Rice ask DCI Tenet what more the United States could do to stop Abu Zubaydah from launching a series of major terrorist attacks probably on Israeli targets but possibly on U S facilities Clarke wrote to Rice and her deputy Stephen Hadley When these attacks occur as they likely will we will wonder what more we could have done to stop them In May CIA Counterterrorist Center CTC Chief Cofer Black told Rice that the current threat level was a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10 as compared to an 8 during the millennium High Probability of Near Term Spectacular Attacks Threat reports surged in June and July reaching an even higher peak of urgency The summer threats seemed to be focused on Saudi Arabia Israel Bahrain Kuwait Yemen and possibly Rome but the danger could be anywhere including a possible attack on the G 8 summit in Genoa A June 12 CIA report passing along biographical background information on several terrorists mentioned in commenting on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed that he was recruiting people to travel to the United States to meet with colleagues already there so that they might conduct terrorist attacks on Bin Ladin s behalf On June 22 the CIA notified all its station chiefs about intelligence suggesting a possible al Qaeda suicide attack on a U S target over the next few days DCITenet asked that all U S ambassadors be briefed That same day the State Department notified all embassies of the terrorist threat and updated its worldwide public warning In June the State Department initiated the Visa Express program in Saudi Arabia as a security measure in order to keep long lines of foreigners away from vulnerable embassy spaces The program permitted visa applications to be made through travel agencies instead of directly at the embassy or consulate A terrorist threat advisory distributed in late June indicated a high probability of near term spectacular terrorist attacks resulting in numerous casualties Other reports titles warned Bin Ladin Attacks May be Imminent and Bin Ladin and Associates Making Near Term Threats The latter reported multiple attacks planned over the coming days including a severe blow against U S and Israeli interests during the next two weeks On June 21 near the height of the threat reporting U S Central Command raised the force protection condition level for U S troops in six countries to the highest possible level Delta The U S Fifth Fleet moved out of its port in Bahrain and a U S Marine Corps exercise in Jordan was halted U S embassies in the Persian Gulf conducted an emergency security review and the embassy in Yemen was closed The CSG had foreign emergency response teams known as FESTs ready to move on four hours notice and kept up the terrorism alert posture on a rolling 24 hour basis On June 25 Clarke warned Rice and Hadley that six separate intelligence reports showed al Qaeda personnel warning of a pending attack An Arabic television station reported Bin Ladin s pleasure with al Qaeda leaders who were saying that the next weeks will witness important surprises and that U S and Israeli interests will be targeted Al Qaeda also released a new recruitment and fund raising tape Clarke wrote that this was all too sophisticated to be merely a psychological operation to keep the United States on edge and the CIA agreed The intelligence reporting consistently described the upcoming attacks as occurring on a calamitous level indicating that they would cause the world to be in turmoil and that they would consist of possible multiple but not necessarily simultaneous attacks On June 28 Clarke wrote Rice that the pattern of al Qaeda activity indicating attack planning over the past six weeks had reached a crescendo A series of new reports continue to convince me and analysts at State CIA DIA Defense Intelligence Agency and NSA that a major terrorist attack or series of attacks is likely in July he noted One al Qaeda intelligence report warned that something very very very very big was about to happen and most of Bin Ladin s network was reportedly anticipating the attack In late June the CIA ordered all its station chiefs to share information on al Qaeda with their host governments and to push for immediate disruptions of cells The headline of a June 30 briefing to top officials was stark Bin Ladin Planning High Profile Attacks The report stated that Bin Ladin operatives expected near term attacks to have dramatic consequences of catastrophic proportions That same day Saudi Arabia declared its highest level of terror alert Despite evidence of delays possibly caused by heightened U S security the planning for attacks was continuing On July 2 the FBI Counterterrorism Division sent a message to federal agencies and state and local law enforcement agencies summarizing information regarding threats from Bin Ladin It warned that there was an increased volume of threat reporting indicating a potential for attacks against U S targets abroad from groups aligned with or sympathetic to Usama Bin Ladin Despite the general warnings the message further stated The FBI has no information indicating a credible threat of terrorist attack in the United States However it went on to emphasize that the possibility of attack in the United States could not be discounted It also noted that the July 4 holiday might heighten the threats The report asked recipients to exercise extreme vigilance and report suspicious activities to the FBI It did not suggest specific actions that they should take to prevent attacks Disruption operations against al Qaeda affiliated cells were launched involving 20 countries Several terrorist operatives were detained by foreign governments possibly disrupting operations in the Gulf and Italy and perhaps averting attacks against two or three U S embassies Clarke and others told us of a particular concern about possible attacks on the Fourth of July After it passed uneventfully the CSG decided to maintain the alert To enlist more international help Vice President Cheney contacted Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah on July 5 Hadley apparently called European counterparts while Clarke worked with senior officials in the Gulf In late July because of threats Italy closed the airspace over Genoa and mounted antiaircraft batteries at the Genoa airport during the G 8 summit which President Bush attended At home the CSG arranged for the CIA to brief intelligence and security officials from several domestic agencies On July 5 representatives from the Immigration and Naturalization Service INS the FAA the Coast Guard the Secret Service Customs the CIA and the FBI met with Clarke to discuss the current threat Attendees report that they were told not to disseminate the threat information they received at the meeting They interpreted this direction to mean that although they could brief their superiors they could not send out advisories to the field An NSC official recalls a somewhat different emphasis saying that attendees were asked to take the information back to their home agencies and do what you can with it subject to classification and distribution restrictions A representative from the INS asked for a summary of the information that she could share with field offices She never received one That same day the CIA briefed Attorney General Ashcroft on the al Qaeda threat warning that a significant terrorist attack was imminent Ashcroft was told that preparations for multiple attacks were in late stages or already complete and that little additional warning could be expected The briefing addressed only threats outside the United States The next day the CIA representative told the CSG that al Qaeda members believed the upcoming attack would be spectacular qualitatively different from anything they had done to date Apparently as a result of the July 5 meeting with Clarke the interagency committee on federal building security was tasked to examine security measures This committee met on July 9 when 37 officials from 27 agencies and organizations were briefed on the current threat level in the United States They were told that not only the threat reports from abroad but also the recent convictions in the East Africa bombings trial the conviction of Ahmed Ressam and the just returned KhobarTowers indictments reinforced the need to exercise extreme vigilance Attendees were expected to determine whether their respective agencies needed enhanced security measures On July 18 2001 the State Department provided a warning to the public regarding possible terrorist attacks in the Arabian Peninsula Acting FBI Director Thomas Pickard told us he had one of his periodic conference calls with all special agents in charge on July 19 He said one of the items he mentioned was the need in light of increased threat reporting to have evidence response teams ready to move at a moment s notice in case of an attack He did not task field offices to try to determine whether any plots were being considered within the United States or to take any action to disrupt any such plots In mid July reporting started to indicate that Bin Ladin s plans had been delayed maybe for as long as two months but not abandoned On July 23 the lead item for CSG discussion was still the al Qaeda threat and it included mention of suspected terrorist travel to the United States On July 31 an FAA circular appeared alerting the aviation community to reports of possible near term terrorist operations particularly on the Arabian Peninsula and or Israel It stated that the FAA had no credible evidence of specific plans to attack U S civil aviation though it noted that some of the currently active terrorist groups were known to plan and train for hijackings and were able to build and conceal sophisticated explosive devices in luggage and consumer products Tenet told us that in his world the system was blinking red By late July Tenet said it could not get any worse Not everyone was convinced Some asked whether all these threats might just be deception On June 30 the SEIB contained an article titled Bin Ladin Threats Are Real Yet Hadley told Tenet in July that Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz questioned the reporting Perhaps Bin Ladin was trying to study U S reactions Tenet replied that he had already addressed the Defense Department s questions on this point the reporting was convincing To give a sense of his anxiety at the time one senior official in the Counterterrorist Center told us that he and a colleague were considering resigning in order to go public with their concerns The Calm Before the Storm On July 27 Clarke informed Rice and Hadley that the spike in intelligence about a near term al Qaeda attack had stopped He urged keeping readiness high during the August vacation period warning that another report suggested an attack had just been postponed for a few months but will still happen On August 1 the FBI issued an advisory that in light of the increased volume of threat reporting and the upcoming anniversary of the East Africa embassy bombings increased attention should be paid to security planning It noted that although most of the reporting indicated a potential for attacks on U S interests abroad the possibility of an attack in the United States could not be discounted On August 3 the intelligence community issued an advisory concluding that the threat of impending al Qaeda attacks would likely continue indefinitely Citing threats in the Arabian Peninsula Jordan Israel and Europe the advisory suggested that al Qaeda was lying in wait and searching for gaps in security before moving forward with the planned attacks During the spring and summer of 2001 President Bush had on several occasions asked his briefers whether any of the threats pointed to the United States Reflecting on these questions the CIA decided to write a briefing article summarizing its understanding of this danger Two CIA analysts involved in preparing this briefing article believed it represented an opportunity to communicate their view that the threat of a Bin Ladin attack in the United States remained both current and serious The result was an article in the August 6 Presidential Daily Brief titled Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in US It was the 36th PDB item briefed so far that year that related to Bin Ladin or al Qaeda and the first devoted to the possibility of an attack in the United States The President told us the August 6 report was historical in nature President Bush said the article told him that al Qaeda was dangerous which he said he had known since he had become President The President said Bin Ladin had long been talking about his desire to attack America He recalled some operational data on the FBI and remembered thinking it was heartening that 70 investigations were under way As best he could recollect Rice had mentioned that the Yemenis surveillance of a federal building in New York had been looked into in May and June but there was no actionable intelligence He did not recall discussing the August 6 report with the Attorney General or whether Rice had done so He said that if his advisers had told him there was a cell in the United States they would have moved to take care of it That never happened Although the following day s SEIB repeated the title of this PDB it did not contain the reference to hijackings the alert in New York the alleged casing of buildings in New York the threat phoned in to the embassy or the fact that the FBI had approximately 70 ongoing bin Ladin related investigations The following is the text of an item from the Presidential Daily Brief received by President George W Bush on August 6 2001 37 Redacted material is indicated by brackets Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US Clandestine foreign government and media reports indicate Bin Ladin since 1997 has wanted to conduct terrorist attacks in the US Bin Ladin implied in US television interviews in 1997 and 1998 that his followers would follow the example of World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef and bring the fighting to America After US missile strikes on his base in Afghanistan in 1998 Bin Ladin told followers he wanted to retaliate in Washington according to a service An Egyptian Islamic Jihad EIJ operative told an service at the same time that Bin Ladin was planning to exploit the operative s access to the US to mount a terrorist strike The millennium plotting in Canada in 1999 may have been part of Bin Ladin s first serious attempt to implement a terrorist strike in the US Convicted plotter Ahmed Ressam has told the FBI that he conceived the idea to attack Los Angeles International Airport himself but that Bin Ladin lieutenant Abu Zubaydah encouraged him and helped facilitate the operation Ressam also said that in 1998 Abu Zubaydah was planning his own US attack Ressam says Bin Ladin was aware of the Los Angeles operation Although Bin Ladin has not succeeded his attacks against the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 demonstrate that he prepares operations years in advance and is not deterred by setbacks Bin Ladin associates surveilled our Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam as early as 1993 and some members of the Nairobi cell planning the bombings were arrested and deported in 1997 Al Qa ida members including some who are US citizens have resided in or traveled to the US for years and the group apparently maintains a support structure that could aid attacks Two al Qua da members found guilty in the conspiracy to bomb our embassies in East Africa were US citizens and a senior EIJ member lived in California in the mid 1990s A clandestine source said in 1998 that a Bin Ladin cell in New York was recruiting Muslim American youth for attacks We have not been able to corroborate some of the more sensational threat reporting such as that from a service in 1998 saying that Bin Ladin wanted to hijack a US aircraft to gain the release of Blind Shaykh Umar Abd al Rahman and other US held extremists Nevertheless FBI information since that time indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks including recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York The FBI is conducting approximately 70 full field investigations throughout the US that it considers Bin Ladin related CIA and the FBI are investigating a call to our Embassy in the UAE in May saying that a group of Bin Ladin supporters was in the US planning attacks with explosives No CSG or other NSC meeting was held to discuss the possible threat of a strike in the United States as a result of this report Late in the month a foreign service reported that Abu Zubaydah was considering mounting terrorist attacks in the United States after postponing possible operations in Europe No targets timing or method of attack were provided We have found no indication of any further discussion before September 11 among the President and his top advisers of the possibility of a threat of an al Qaeda attack in the United States DCI Tenet visited President Bush in Crawford Texas on August 17 and participated in PDB briefings of the President between August 31 after the President had returned to Washington and September 10 But Tenet does not recall any discussions with the President of the domestic threat during this period Most of the intelligence community recognized in the summer of 2001 that the number and severity of threat reports were unprecedented Many officials told us that they knew something terrible was planned and they were desperate to stop it Despite their large number the threats received contained few specifics regarding time place method or target Most suggested that attacks were planned against targets overseas others indicated threats against unspecified U S interests We cannot say for certain whether these reports as dramatic as they were related to the 9 11 attacks Government Response to the Threats National Security Advisor Rice told us that the CSG was the nerve center for running the crisis although other senior officials were involved over the course of the summer In addition to his daily meetings with President Bush and weekly meetings to go over other issues with Rice Tenet was speaking regularly with Secretary of State Colin Powell and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld The foreign policy principals routinely talked on the telephone every day on a variety of topics Hadley told us that before 9 11 he and Rice did not feel they had the job of coordinating domestic agencies They felt that Clarke and the CSG part of the NSC were the NSC s bridge between foreign and domestic threats There was a clear disparity in the levels of response to foreign versus domestic threats Numerous actions were taken overseas to disrupt possible attacks enlisting foreign partners to upset terrorist plans closing embassies moving military assets out of the way of possible harm Far less was done domestically in part surely because to the extent that specifics did exist they pertained to threats overseas As noted earlier a threat against the embassy in Yemen quickly resulted in its closing Possible domestic threats were more vague When reports did not specify where the attacks were to take place officials presumed that they would again be overseas though they did not rule out a target in the United States Each of the FBI threat advisories made this point Clarke mentioned to National Security Advisor Rice at least twice that al Qaeda sleeper cells were likely in the United States In January 2001 Clarke forwarded a strategy paper to Rice warning that al Qaeda had a presence in the United States He noted that two key al Qaeda members in the Jordanian cell involved in the millennium plot were naturalized U S citizens and that one jihadist suspected in the East Africa bombings had informed the FBI that an extensive network of al Qida sleeper agents currently exists in the US He added that Ressam s abortive December 1999 attack revealed al Qaeda supporters in the United States His analysis however was based not on new threat reporting but on past experience The September 11 attacks fell into the void between the foreign and domestic threats The foreign intelligence agencies were watching overseas alert to foreign threats to U S interests there The domestic agencies were waiting for evidence of a domestic threat from sleeper cells within the United States No one was looking for a foreign threat to domestic targets The threat that was coming was not from sleeper cells It was foreign but from foreigners who had infiltrated into the United States A second cause of this disparity in response is that domestic agencies did not know what to do and no one gave them direction Cressey told us that the CSG did not tell the agencies how to respond to the threats He noted that the agencies that were operating overseas did not need direction on how to respond they had experience with such threats and had a playbook In contrast the domestic agencies did not have a game plan Neither the NSC including the CSG nor anyone else instructed them to create one This lack of direction was evident in the July 5 meeting with representatives from the domestic agencies The briefing focused on overseas threats The domestic agencies were not questioned about how they planned to address the threat and were not told what was expected of them Indeed as noted earlier they were specifically told they could not issue advisories based on the briefing 46 The domestic agencies limited response indicates that they did not perceive a call to action Clarke reflected a different perspective in an email to Rice on September 15 2001 He summarized the steps taken by the CSG to alert domestic agencies to the possibility of an attack in the United States Clarke concluded that domestic agencies including the FAA knew that the CSG believed a major al Qaeda attack was coming and could be in the United States Although the FAA had authority to issue security directives mandating new security procedures none of the few that were released during the summer of 2001 increased security at checkpoints or on board aircraft The information circulars mostly urged air carriers to exercise prudence and be alert Prior to 9 11 the FAA did present a CD ROM to air carriers and airport authorities describing the increased threat to civil aviation The presentation mentioned the possibility of suicide hijackings but said that fortunately we have no indication that any group is currently thinking in that direction The FAA conducted 27 special security briefings for specific air carriers between May 1 2001 and September 11 2001 Two of these briefings discussed the hijacking threat overseas None discussed the possibility of suicide hijackings or the use of aircraft as weapons No new security measures were instituted Rice told us she understood that the FBI had tasked its 56 U S field offices to increase surveillance of suspected terrorists and to reach out to informants who might have information about terrorist plots An NSC staff document at the time describes such a tasking as having occurred in late June but does not indicate whether it was generated by the NSC or the FBI Other than the previously described April 13 communication sent to all FBI field offices however the FBI could not find any record of having received such a directive The April 13 document asking field offices to gather information on Sunni extremism did not mention any possible threat within the United States and did not order surveillance of suspected operatives The NSC did not specify what the FBI s directives should contain and did not review what had been issued earlier Acting FBI Director Pickard told us that in addition to his July 19 conference call he mentioned the heightened terrorist threat in individual calls with the special agents in charge of field offices during their annual performance review discussions In speaking with agents around the country we found little evidence that any such concerns had reached FBI personnel beyond the New York Field Office The head of counterterrorism at the FBI Dale Watson said he had many discussions about possible attacks with Cofer Black at the CIA They had expected an attack on July 4 Watson said he felt deeply that something was going to happen But he told us the threat information was nebulous He wished he had known more He wished he had had 500 analysts looking at Usama Bin Ladin threat information instead of two Attorney General Ashcroft was briefed by the CIA in May and by Pickard in early July about the danger Pickard said he met with Ashcroft once a week in late June through July and twice in August There is a dispute regarding Ashcroft s interest in Pickard s briefings about the terrorist threat situation Pickard told us that after two such briefings Ashcroft told him that he did not want to hear about the threats anymore Ashcroft denies Pickard s charge Pickard says he continued to present terrorism information during further briefings that summer but nothing further on the chatter the U S government was receiving The Attorney General told us he asked Pickard whether there was intelligence about attacks in the United States and that Pickard said no Pickard said he replied that he could not assure Ashcroft that there would be no attacks in the United States although the reports of threats were related to overseas targets Ashcroft said he therefore assumed the FBI was doing what it needed to do He acknowledged that in retrospect this was a dangerous assumption He did not ask the FBI what it was doing in response to the threats and did not task it to take any specific action He also did not direct the INS then still part of the Department of Justice to take any specific action In sum the domestic agencies never mobilized in response to the threat They did not have direction and did not have a plan to institute The borders were not hardened Transportation systems were not fortified Electronic surveillance was not targeted against a domestic threat State and local law enforcement were not marshaled to augment the FBI s efforts The public was not warned The terrorists exploited deep institutional failings within our government The question is whether extra vigilance might have turned up an opportunity to disrupt the plot As seen in chapter 7 al Qaeda s operatives made mistakes At least two such mistakes created opportunities during 2001 especially in late August LATE LEADS MIHDHAR MOUSSAOUI AND KSM In chapter 6 we discussed how intelligence agencies successfully detected some of the early travel in the planes operation picking up the movements of Khalid al Mihdhar and identifying him and seeing his travel converge with someone they perhaps could have identified but did not Nawaf al Hazmi as well as with less easily identifiable people such as Khallad and Abu Bara These observations occurred in December 1999 and January 2000 The trail had been lost in January 2000 without a clear realization that it had been lost and without much effort to pick it up again Nor had the CIA placed Mihdhar on the State Department s watchlist for suspected terrorists so that either an embassy or a port of entry might take note if Mihdhar showed up again On four occasions in 2001 the CIA the FBI or both had apparent opportunities to refocus on the significance of Hazmi and Mihdhar and reinvigorate the search for them After reviewing those episodes we will turn to the handling of the Moussaoui case and some late leads regarding Khalid Sheikh Mohammed January 2001 Identification of Khallad Almost one year after the original trail had been lost in Bangkok the FBI and the CIA were working on the investigation of the Cole bombing They learned of the link between a captured conspirator and a person called Khallad They also learned that Khallad was a senior security official for Bin Ladin who had helped direct the bombing we introduced Khallad in chapter 5 and returned to his role in the Cole bombing in chapter 6 55 One of the members of the FBI s investigative team in Yemen realized that he had heard of Khallad before from a joint FBI CIA source four months earlier The FBI agent obtained from a foreign government a photo of the person believed to have directed the Cole bombing It was shown to the source and he confirmed that the man in that photograph was the same Khallad he had described In December 2000 on the basis of some links associated with Khalid al Mihdhar the CIA s Bin Ladin unit speculated that Khallad and Khalid al Mihdhar might be one and the same The CIA asked that a Kuala Lumpur surveillance photo of Mihdhar be shown to the joint source who had identified Khallad In early January 2001 two photographs from the Kuala Lumpur meeting were shown to the source One was a known photograph of Mihdhar the other a photograph of a then unknown subject The source did not recognize Mihdhar But he indicated he was 90 percent certain that the other individual was Khallad This meant that Khallad and Mihdhar were two different people It also meant that there was a link between Khallad and Mihdhar making Mihdhar seem even more suspicious 59Yet we found no effort by the CIA to renew the long abandoned search for Mihdhar or his travel companions In addition we found that the CIA did not notify the FBI of this identification DCITenet and Cofer Black testified before Congress s Joint Inquiry into 9 11 that the FBI had access to this identification from the beginning But drawing on an extensive record including documents that were not available to the CIA personnel who drafted that testimony we conclude this was not the case The FBI s primary Cole investigators had no knowledge that Khallad had been in Kuala Lumpur with Mihdhar and others until after the September 11 attacks Because the FBI had not been informed in January 2000 about Mihdhar s possession of a U S visa it had not then started looking for him in the United States Because it did not know of the links between Khallad and Mihdhar it did not start looking for him in January 2001 This incident is an example of how day to day gaps in information sharing can emerge even when there is mutual goodwill The information was from a joint FBI CIA source who spoke essentially no English and whose languages were not understood by the FBI agent on the scene overseas Issues of travel and security necessarily kept short the amount of time spent with the source As a result the CIA officer usually did not translate either questions or answers for his FBI colleague and friend For interviews without simultaneous translation the FBI agent on the scene received copies of the reports that the CIA disseminated to other agencies regarding the interviews But he was not given access to the CIA s internal operational reports which contained more detail It was there in reporting to which FBI investigators did not have access that information regarding the January 2001 identification of Khallad appeared The CIA officer does not recall this particular identification and thus cannot say why it was not shared with his FBI colleague He might not have understood the possible significance of the new identification In June 2000 Mihdhar left California and returned to Yemen It is possible that if in January 2001 the CIA had resumed its search for him placed him on the State Department s TIPOFF watchlist or provided the FBI with the information he might have been found either before or at the time he applied for a new visa in June 2001 or when he returned to the United States on July 4 Spring 2001 Looking Again at Kuala Lumpur By mid May 2001 as the threat reports were surging a CIA official detailed to the International Terrorism Operations Section at the FBI wondered where the attacks might occur We will call him John Recalling the episode about the Kuala Lumpur travel of Mihdhar and his associates John searched the CIA s databases for information regarding the travel On May 15 he and an official at the CIA reexamined many of the old cables from early 2000 including the information that Mihdhar had a U S visa and that Hazmi had come to Los Angeles on January 15 2000 The CIA official who reviewed the cables took no action regarding them John however began a lengthy exchange with a CIA analyst whom we will call Dave to figure out what these cables meant John was aware of how dangerous Khallad was at one point calling him a major league killer He concluded that something bad was definitely up Despite the U S links evident in this traffic John made no effort to determine whether any of these individuals was in the United States He did not raise that possibility with his FBI counterpart He was focused on Malaysia John described the CIA as an agency that tended to play a zone defense He was worrying solely about Southeast Asia not the United States In contrast he told us the FBI tends to play man to man Desk officers at the CIA s Bin Ladin unit did not have cases in the same sense as an FBI agent who works an investigation from beginning to end Thus when the trail went cold after the Kuala Lumpur meeting in January 2000 the desk officer moved on to different things By the time the March 2000 cable arrived with information that one of the travelers had flown to Los Angeles the case officer was no longer responsible for follow up While several individuals at the Bin Ladin unit opened the cable when it arrived in March 2000 no action was taken The CIA s zone defense concentrated on where not who Had its information been shared with the FBI a combination of the CIA s zone defense and the FBI s man to man approach might have been productive June 2001 The Meeting in New York John s review of the Kuala Lumpur meeting did set off some more sharing of information getting the attention of an FBI analyst whom we will call Jane Jane was assigned to the FBI s Cole investigation She knew that another terrorist involved in that operation Fahd al Quso had traveled to Bangkok in January 2000 to give money to Khallad Jane and the CIA analyst Dave had been working together on Colerelated issues Chasing Quso s trail Dave suggested showing some photographs to FBI agents in New York who were working on the Cole case and had interviewed Quso John gave three Kuala Lumpur surveillance pictures to Jane to show to the New York agents She was told that one of the individuals in the photographs was someone named Khalid al Mihdhar She did not know why the photographs had been taken or why the Kuala Lumpur travel might be significant and she was not told that someone had identified Khallad in the photographs When Jane did some research in a database for intelligence reports Intelink she found the original NSA reports on the planning for the meeting Because the CIA had not disseminated reports on its tracking of Mihdhar Jane did not pull up any information about Mihdhar s U S visa or about travel to the United States by Hazmi or Mihdhar Jane Dave and an FBI analyst who was on detail to the CIA s Bin Ladin unit went to New York on June 11 to meet with the agents about the Cole case Jane brought the surveillance pictures At some point in the meeting she showed the photographs to the agents and asked whether they recognized Quso in any of them The agents asked questions about the photographs Why were they taken Why were these people being followed Where are the rest of the photographs The only information Jane had about the meeting other than the photographs were the NSA reports that she had found on Intelink These reports however contained caveats that their contents could not be shared with criminal investigators without the permission of the Justice Department s Office of Intelligence Policy and Review OIPR Therefore Jane concluded that she could not pass on information from those reports to the agents This decision was potentially significant because the signals intelligence she did not share linked Mihdhar to a suspected terrorist facility in the Middle East The agents would have established a link to the suspected facility from their work on the embassy bombings case This link would have made them very interested in learning more about Mihdhar The sad irony is that the agents who found the source were being kept from obtaining the fruits of their own work Dave the CIA analyst knew more about the Kuala Lumpur meeting He knew that Mihdhar possessed a U S visa that his visa application indicated that he intended to travel to New York that Hazmi had traveled to Los Angeles and that a source had put Mihdhar in the company of Khallad No one at the meeting asked him what he knew he did not volunteer anything He told investigators that as a CIA analyst he was not authorized to answer FBI questions regarding CIA information Jane said she assumed that if Dave knew the answers to questions he would have volunteered them The New York agents left the meeting without obtaining information that might have started them looking for Mihdhar Mihdhar had been a weak link in al Qaeda s operational planning He had left the United States in June 2000 a mistake KSM realized could endanger the entire plan for to continue with the operation Mihdhar would have to travel to the United States again And unlike other operatives Mihdhar was not clean he had jihadist connections It was just such connections that had brought him to the attention of U S officials Nevertheless in this case KSM s fears were not realized Mihdhar received a new U S visa two days after the CIA FBI meeting in New York He flew to New York City on July 4 No one was looking for him August 2001 The Search for Mihdhar and Hazmi Begins and Fails During the summer of 2001 John following a good instinct but not as part of any formal assignment asked Mary an FBI analyst detailed to the CIA s Bin Ladin unit to review all the Kuala Lumpur materials one more time She had been at the New York meeting with Jane and Dave but had not looked into the issues yet herself John asked her to do the research in her free time Mary began her work on July 24 That day she found the cable reporting that Mihdhar had a visa to the United States A week later she found the cable reporting that Mihdhar s visa application what was later discovered to be his first application listed New York as his destination On August 21 she located the March 2000 cable that noted with interest that Hazmi had flown to Los Angeles in January 2000 She immediately grasped the significance of this information Mary and Jane promptly met with an INS representative at FBI headquarters On August 22 the INS told them that Mihdhar had entered the United States on January 15 2000 and again on July 4 2001 Jane and Mary also learned that there was no record that Hazmi had left the country since January 2000 and they assumed he had left with Mihdhar in June 2000 They decided that if Mihdhar was in the United States he should be found They divided up the work Mary asked the Bin Ladin unit to draft a cable requesting that Mihdhar and Hazmi be put on the TIPOFF watchlist Both Hazmi and Mihdhar were added to this watchlist on August 24 Jane took responsibility for the search effort inside the United States As the information indicated that Mihdhar had last arrived in New York she began drafting what is known as a lead for the FBI s New York Field Office A lead relays information from one part of the FBI to another and requests that a particular action be taken She called an agent in New York to give him a headsup on the matter but her draft lead was not sent until August 28 Her email told the New York agent that she wanted him to get started as soon as possible but she labeled the lead as Routine a designation that informs the receiving office that it has 30 days to respond The agent who received the lead forwarded it to his squad supervisor That same day the supervisor forwarded the lead to an intelligence agent to open an intelligence case an agent who thus was behind the wall keeping FBI intelligence information from being shared with criminal prosecutors He also sent it to the Cole case agents and an agent who had spent significant time in Malaysia searching for another Khalid Khalid Sheikh Mohammad The suggested goal of the investigation was to locate Mihdhar determine his contacts and reasons for being in the United States and possibly conduct an interview Before sending the lead Jane had discussed it with John the CIA official on detail to the FBI She had also checked with the acting head of the FBI s Bin Ladin unit The discussion seems to have been limited to whether the search should be classified as an intelligence investigation or as a criminal one It appears that no one informed higher levels of management in either the FBI or CIA about the case There is no evidence that the lead or the search for these terrorist suspects was substantively discussed at any level above deputy chief of a section within the Counterterrorism Division at FBI headquarters One of the Cole case agents read the lead with interest and contacted Jane to obtain more information Jane argued however that because the agent was designated a criminal FBI agent not an intelligence FBI agent the wall kept him from participating in any search for Mihdhar In fact she felt he had to destroy his copy of the lead because it contained NSA information from reports that included caveats ordering that the information not be shared without OIPR s permission The agent asked Jane to get an opinion from the FBI s National Security Law Unit NSLU on whether he could open a criminal case on Mihdhar Jane sent an email to the Cole case agent explaining that according to the NSLU the case could be opened only as an intelligence matter and that if Mihdhar was found only designated intelligence agents could conduct or even be present at any interview She appears to have misunderstood the complex rules that could apply to this situation The FBI agent angrily responded Whatever has happened to this someday someone will die and wall or not the public will not understand why we were not more effective and throwing every resource we had at certain problems Let s hope the National Security Law Unit will stand behind their decisions then especially since the biggest threat to us now UBL is getting the most protection Jane replied that she was not making up the rules she claimed that they were in the relevant manual and ordered by the FISA Court and every office of the FBI is required to follow them including FBI NY It is now clear that everyone involved was confused about the rules governing the sharing and use of information gathered in intelligence channels Because Mihdhar was being sought for his possible connection to or knowledge of the Cole bombing he could be investigated or tracked under the existing Cole criminal case No new criminal case was needed for the criminal agent to begin searching for Mihdhar And as NSA had approved the passage of its information to the criminal agent he could have conducted a search using all available information As a result of this confusion the criminal agents who were knowledgeable about al Qaeda and experienced with criminal investigative techniques including finding suspects and possible criminal charges were thus excluded from the search The search was assigned to one FBI agent and it was his very first counterterrorism lead Because the lead was routine he was given 30 days to open an intelligence case and make some unspecified efforts to locate Mihdhar He started the process a few days later He checked local New York databases for criminal record and driver s license information and checked the hotel listed on Mihdhar s U S entry form Finally on September 11 the agent sent a lead to Los Angeles because Mihdhar had initially arrived in Los Angeles in January 2000 We believe that if more resources had been applied and a significantly different approach taken Mihdhar and Hazmi might have been found They had used their true names in the United States Still the investigators would have needed luck as well as skill to find them prior to September 11 even if such searches had begun as early as August 23 when the lead was first drafted Many FBI witnesses have suggested that even if Mihdhar had been found there was nothing the agents could have done except follow him onto the planes We believe this is incorrect Both Hazmi and Mihdhar could have been held for immigration violations or as material witnesses in the Cole bombing case Investigation or interrogation of them and investigation of their travel and financial activities could have yielded evidence of connections to other participants in the 9 11 plot The simple fact of their detention could have derailed the plan In any case the opportunity did not arise Phoenix Memo The Phoenix memo was investigated thoroughly by the Joint Inquiry and the Department of Justice Inspector General 86We will recap it briefly here In July 2001 an FBI agent in the Phoenix field office sent a memo to FBI headquarters and to two agents on international terrorism squads in the New York Field Office advising of the possibility of a coordinated effort by Usama Bin Ladin to send students to the United States to attend civil aviation schools The agent based his theory on the inordinate number of individuals of investigative interest attending such schools in Arizona The agent made four recommendations to FBI headquarters to compile a list of civil aviation schools establish liaison with those schools discuss his theories about Bin Ladin with the intelligence community and seek authority to obtain visa information on persons applying to flight schools His recommendations were not acted on His memo was forwarded to one field office Managers of the Usama Bin Ladin unit and the Radical Fundamentalist unit at FBI headquarters were addressees but they did not even see the memo until after September 11 No managers at headquarters saw the memo before September 11 and the New York Field Office took no action As its author told investigators the Phoenix memo was not an alert about suicide pilots His worry was more about a Pan Am Flight 103 scenario in which explosives were placed on an aircraft The memo s references to aviation training were broad including aeronautical engineering If the memo had been distributed in a timely fashion and its recommendations acted on promptly we do not believe it would have uncovered the plot It might well however have sensitized the FBI so that it might have taken the Moussaoui matter more seriously the next month Zacarias Moussaoui On August 15 2001 the Minneapolis FBI Field Office initiated an intelligence investigation on Zacarias Moussaoui As mentioned in chapter 7 he had entered the United States in February 2001 and had begun flight lessons at Airman Flight School in Norman Oklahoma He resumed his training at the Pan Am International Flight Academy in Eagan Minnesota starting on August 13 He had none of the usual qualifications for flight training on Pan Am s Boeing 747 flight simulators He said he did not intend to become a commercial pilot but wanted the training as an ego boosting thing Moussaoui stood out because with little knowledge of flying he wanted to learn how to take off and land a Boeing 747 The agent in Minneapolis quickly learned that Moussaoui possessed jihadist beliefs Moreover Moussaoui had 32 000 in a bank account but did not provide a plausible explanation for this sum of money He had traveled to Pakistan but became agitated when asked if he had traveled to nearby countries while in Pakistan Pakistan was the customary route to the training camps in Afghanistan He planned to receive martial arts training and intended to purchase a global positioning receiver The agent also noted that Moussaoui became extremely agitated whenever he was questioned regarding his religious beliefs The agent concluded that Moussaoui was an Islamic extremist preparing for some future act in furtherance of radical fundamentalist goals He also believed Moussaoui s plan was related to his flight training Moussaoui can be seen as an al Qaeda mistake and a missed opportunity An apparently unreliable operative he had fallen into the hands of the FBI As discussed in chapter 7 Moussaoui had been in contact with and received money from Ramzi Binalshibh If Moussaoui had been connected to al Qaeda questions should instantly have arisen about a possible al Qaeda plot that involved piloting airliners a possibility that had never been seriously analyzed by the intelligence community The FBI agent who handled the case in conjunction with the INS representative on the Minneapolis Joint Terrorism Task Force suspected that Moussaoui might be planning to hijack a plane Minneapolis and FBI headquarters debated whether Moussaoui should be arrested immediately or surveilled to obtain additional information Because it was not clear whether Moussaoui could be imprisoned the FBI case agent decided the most important thing was to prevent Moussaoui from obtaining any further training that he could use to carry out a potential attack As a French national who had overstayed his visa Moussaoui could be detained immediately The INS arrested Moussaoui on the immigration violation A deportation order was signed on August 17 2001 The agents in Minnesota were concerned that the U S Attorney s Office in Minneapolis would find insufficient probable cause of a crime to obtain a criminal warrant to search Moussaoui s laptop computer Agents at FBI headquarters believed there was insufficient probable cause Minneapolis therefore sought a special warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to conduct the search we introduced FISA in chapter 3 To do so however the FBI needed to demonstrate probable cause that Moussaoui was an agent of a foreign power a demonstration that was not required to obtain a criminal warrant but was a statutory requirement for a FISA warrant The case agent did not have sufficient information to connect Moussaoui to a foreign power so he reached out for help in the United States and overseas The FBI agent s August 18 message requested assistance from the FBI legal attach in Paris Moussaoui had lived in London so the Minneapolis agent sought assistance from the legal attach there as well By August 24 the Minneapolis agent had also contacted an FBI detailee and a CIA desk officer at the Counterterrorist Center about the case The FBI legal attach s office in Paris first contacted the French government on August 16 or 17 shortly after speaking to the Minneapolis case agent on the telephone On August 22 and 27 the French provided information that made a connection between Moussaoui and a rebel leader in Chechnya Ibn al Khattab This set off a spirited debate between the Minneapolis Field Office FBI headquarters and the CIA as to whether the Chechen rebels and Khattab were sufficiently associated with a terrorist organization to constitute a foreign power for purposes of the FISA statute FBI headquarters did not believe this was good enough and its National Security Law Unit declined to submit a FISA application After receiving the written request for assistance the legal attach in London had promptly forwarded it to his counterparts in the British government hand delivering the request on August 21 On August 24 the CIA also sent a cable to London and Paris regarding subjects involved in suspicious 747 flight training that described Moussaoui as a possible suicide hijacker On August 28 the CIA sent a request for information to a different service of the British government this communication warned that Moussaoui might be expelled to Britain by the end of August The FBI office in London raised the matter briefly with British officials as an aside after a meeting about a more urgent matter on September 3 and sent the British service a written update on September 5 The case was not handled by the British as a priority amid a large number of other terrorist related inquiries On September 4 the FBI sent a teletype to the CIA the FAA the Customs Service the State Department the INS and the Secret Service summarizing the known facts regarding Moussaoui It did not report the case agent s personal assessment that Moussaoui planned to hijack an airplane It did contain the FAA s comment that it was not unusual for Middle Easterners to attend flight training schools in the United States Although the Minneapolis agents wanted to tell the FAA from the beginning about Moussaoui FBI headquarters instructed Minneapolis that it could not share the more complete report the case agent had prepared for the FAA The Minneapolis supervisor sent the case agent in person to the local FAA office to fill in what he thought were gaps in the FBI headquarters teletype No FAA actions seem to have been taken in response There was substantial disagreement between Minneapolis agents and FBI headquarters as to what Moussaoui was planning to do In one conversation between a Minneapolis supervisor and a headquarters agent the latter complained that Minneapolis s FISA request was couched in a manner intended to get people spun up The supervisor replied that was precisely his intent He said he was trying to keep someone from taking a plane and crashing into the World Trade Center The headquarters agent replied that this was not going to happen and that they did not know if Moussaoui was a terrorist There is no evidence that either FBI Acting Director Pickard or Assistant Director for Counterterrorism Dale Watson was briefed on the Moussaoui case prior to 9 11 Michael Rolince the FBI assistant director heading the Bureau s InternationalTerrorism Operations Section ITOS recalled being told about Moussaoui in two passing hallway conversations but only in the context that he might be receiving telephone calls from Minneapolis complaining about how headquarters was handling the matter He never received such a call Although the acting special agent in charge of Minneapolis called the ITOS supervisors to discuss the Moussaoui case on August 27 he declined to go up the chain of command at FBI headquarters and call Rolince On August 23 DCI Tenet was briefed about the Moussaoui case in a briefing titled Islamic Extremist Learns to Fly Tenet was also told that Moussaoui wanted to learn to fly a 747 paid for his training in cash was interested to learn the doors do not open in flight and wanted to fly a simulated flight from London to New York He was told that the FBI had arrested Moussaoui because of a visa overstay and that the CIA was working the case with the FBI Tenet told us that no connection to al Qaeda was apparent to him at the time Seeing it as an FBI case he did not discuss the matter with anyone at the White House or the FBI No connection was made between Moussaoui s presence in the United States and the threat reporting during the summer of 2001 On September 11 after the attacks the FBI office in London renewed their appeal for information about Moussaoui In response to U S requests the British government supplied some basic biographical information about Moussaoui The British government informed us that it also immediately tasked intelligence collection facilities for information about Moussaoui On September 13 the British government received new sensitive intelligence that Moussaoui had attended an al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan It passed this intelligence to the United States on the same day Had this information been available in late August 2001 the Moussaoui case would almost certainly have received intense high level attention The FBI also learned after 9 11 that the millennium terrorist Ressam who by 2001 was cooperating with investigators recognized Moussaoui as someone who had been in the Afghan camps As mentioned above before 9 11 the FBI agents in Minneapolis had failed to persuade supervisors at headquarters that there was enough evidence to seek a FISA warrant to search Moussaoui s computer hard drive and belongings Either the British information or the Ressam identification would have broken the logjam A maximum U S effort to investigate Moussaoui conceivably could have unearthed his connections to Binalshibh Those connections might have brought investigators to the core of the 9 11 plot The Binalshibh connection was recognized shortly after 9 11 though it was not an easy trail to find Discovering it would have required quick and very substantial cooperation from the German government which might well have been difficult to obtain However publicity about Moussaoui s arrest and a possible hijacking threat might have derailed the plot 107With time the search for Mihdhar and Hazmi and the investigation of Moussaoui might also have led to a breakthrough that would have disrupted the plot Khalid Sheikh Mohammed Another late opportunity was presented by a confluence of information regarding Khalid Sheikh Mohammed received by the intelligence community in the summer of 2001 The possible links between KSM Moussaoui and an individual only later identified as Ramzi Binalshibh would remain undiscovered however Although we readily equate KSM with al Qaeda today this was not the case before 9 11 KSM who had been indicted in January 1996 for his role in the Manila air plot was seen primarily as another freelance terrorist associated with Ramzi Yousef Because the links between KSM and Bin Ladin or al Qaeda were not recognized at the time responsibility for KSM remained in the small Islamic Extremist Branch of the Counterterrorist Center not in the Bin Ladin unit Moreover because KSM had already been indicted he became targeted for arrest In 1997 the Counterterrorist Center added a Renditions Branch to help find wanted fugitives Responsibility for KSM was transferred to this branch which gave the CIA a man to man focus but was not an analytical unit When subsequent information came more critical for analysis than for tracking no unit had the job of following up on what the information might mean For example in September 2000 a source had reported that an individual named Khalid al Shaykh al Ballushi was a key lieutenant in al Qaeda Al Ballushi means from Baluchistan and KSM is from Baluchistan Recognizing the possible significance of this information the Bin Ladin unit sought more information When no information was forthcoming the Bin Ladin unit dropped the matter When additional pieces of the puzzle arrived in the spring and summer of 2001 they were not put together The first piece of the puzzle concerned some intriguing information associated with a person known as Mukhtar that the CIA had begun analyzing in April 2001 The CIA did not know who Mukhtar was at the time only that he associated with al Qaeda lieutenant Abu Zubaydah and that based on the nature of the information he was evidently involved in planning possible terrorist activities The second piece of the puzzle was some alarming information regarding KSM On June 12 2001 a CIA report said that Khaled was actively recruiting people to travel outside Afghanistan including to the United States where colleagues were reportedly already in the country to meet them to carry out terrorist related activities for Bin Ladin CIA headquarters presumed from the details of the reporting that this person was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed In July the same source was shown a series of photographs and identified a photograph of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as the Khaled he had previously discussed The final piece of the puzzle arrived at the CIA s Bin Ladin unit on August 28 in a cable reporting that KSM s nickname was Mukhtar No one made the connection to the reports about Mukhtar that had been circulated in the spring This connection might also have underscored concern about the June reporting that KSM was recruiting terrorists to travel including to the United States Only after 9 11 would it be discovered that Muhktar KSM had communicated with a phone that was used by Binalshibh and that Binalshibh had used the same phone to communicate with Moussaoui as discussed in chapter 7 As in the Moussaoui situation already described the links to Binalshibh might not have been an easy trail to find and would have required substantial cooperation from the German government But time was short and running out Time Runs Out As Tenet told us the system was blinking red during the summer of 2001 Officials were alerted across the world Many were doing everything they possibly could to respond to the threats Yet no one working on these late leads in the summer of 2001 connected the case in his or her in box to the threat reports agitating senior officials and being briefed to the President Thus these individual cases did not become national priorities As the CIA supervisor John told us no one looked at the bigger picture no analytic work foresaw the lightning that could connect the thundercloud to the ground We see little evidence that the progress of the plot was disturbed by any government action The U S government was unable to capitalize on mistakes made by al Qaeda Time ran out
