 uh yes i do believe that there is too much immigration now well yeah a well yeah living in Texas especially i see it and and did you well it s not just that are there enough jobs for people here now no no it s terrible and yet they re letting more people in daily yeah from everywhere too not just from Mexico you know just everywhere yeah yeah i wasn t talking about just Mexico i was talking about Europeans the Eastern Block uh it s terrible yeah yeah i there s and there s nothing we can do about it the government seems to do as they wish when they wish yeah they don t ask us do they no you know and it s really hard i think on the immigrants because they come over here all they you know thinking that they re going to have money and jobs and success and everything and then they then there is no jobs and they end up homeless and not knowing anybody and no money and it s terrible yes living under a bridge so to speak now it s true though that the bulk of of immigrants yes are successful really and true how how how how do you figure uh i saw it on the news uh i saw it on the news yes the bulk of immigrants legal immigrants to this country are successful you know they pay to end up as tax paying citizens did you really making uh above middle class income whatever that is in the the united states now probably more than what i m making maybe i should become an immigrant and go somewhere else well yeah you work for TI uh they say that s due to their work ethic now i don t know if that s true or not it just might be a matter of luck well but then America always has been for the immigrant yeah well uh you know if it hadn t been for that i guess i wouldn t be here because my family came from France and uh one side and one side came from Germany so huh none of us would yeah there you know there s only a very few native Americans here and then they re treated rotten the actual Native Americans the Indians well they ve got they they ve got the worst deal around yes they are well most of them you re right but then i drive through Riodosa and i think well not all of them have it desperately bad i ve never you know you ve you ve driven by you know the Mountain Gods outside of Riodosa haven t you i ve never been been out there oh it s beautiful country up there in the mountains of New Mexico uh huh oh just just gorgeous and that inn is huge and but now uh like i say that one tribe is the exception not the rule yeah you know most tribes were treated dreadfully yeah oh and still are and still are yes you know don t have good jobs and living on reservations alcoholics and oh it s terrible it makes me really ill but i ve never even been to Colorado oh a native Texan no a native Californian but a twenty year Texan i ve been here twenty years so oh well i m i m i m a native born Texan but uh you know how it is yeah yeah we go where the work is that s true that s true well did you start with TI out here and then go to uh in Lubbock and oh okay and then went to Colorado yeah in seventy four so so yes i am i am a long time TIer so do you see a lot of uh well let s see what s in Colorado do you see a lot of immigrants of any kind like like we do here uh the ones we see are Americans by marriage a huge number here in Colorado Springs there s an Air Force base and an army base uh huh so there s people that marry GIs Korean Americans German Americans uh a few Japanese oh okay yeah few Chinese you understand yeah yeah but then you know too on a it s uh of course what i think about when we talk about immigrants i know they re coming from everywhere but i think a lot about coming from Mexico because i guess i m so close to that and if they close the well the borders are closed basically i mean they re but we get all these people that come in illegally and stay yeah well that s not really immigration well no that s true it s not but it is i mean they re coming i mean we ve we ve got yeah yeah you can t stop them and once they re here to some extent we support them they re supposed to have all these laws passed where people aren t supposed to hire illegal aliens and all this and whether that s working or not i don t know because i don t hear anymore about it i don t either but uh what i suspect is that illegals were hired for a hundred and fifty years of Texas history i don t think they can stop it by a federal edict i don t think the federal government can stop it by making by waving their magic wand and saying it will happen no more it s just too inbred in the culture you know yeah i grew up in Dumas and Lubbock and uh every roofing crew was illegal i know well all the restaurants here too at one time now it s see how i m not in the restaurant business anymore so i really don t know but at one time the whole kitchen crew and the busboys and everything were all illegals in in most of the restaurants i worked in as a waitress you know it whether that came to a halt i don t know sure see uh still some migrant labor is legal you know in California i know it is it is in Texas too is it too in Texas also i i didn t know yes yeah during cotton harvest and whenever the the uh tomatoes and all are but see they ll come in and do work that other people won t do now i don t know about this day and time when there s so many people out of work i know if i was out of work i d do anything to make money well because it s pretty scary when you own a home and you know well the truth of the matter is i don t know what your home payments are but you couldn t make a living on what they earn you could you could not you could not have you seen how those poor people live huh uh migrant labor camps oh my God they live in cardboard boxes oh it s horrible isn t it and these fine Americans take care of them um hum see and they put their children to work and everything don t they and i yes and i don t hold it against the people no they re hard workers trying to make it and no one and see Americans wouldn t do it wouldn t they wouldn t live like that no they wouldn t do it no they ll they ll ask for a handout first you couldn t get the street people i was just going to say you couldn t get these homeless people probably to do that i see them on corners with signs saying i ll work for a meal but i ll bet you if you stopped and you offered them a meal if they d come and do your yard they d get out of it some way they just really would no no what they re doing is they re asking for handouts that s right that s right because if you took them into your home to to work in your yard or whatever they d know where your house is and how to break in then i know it or now that s not true of all of them there are but how do you know the good from the bad i i don t i don t know but i m sure that times being as hard as they are and times are hard not everyone s that way you know good people are being put out of jobs now oh yes how well i know i was laid off last year but i was i was lucky because i was one of the first groups to go from TI well in in division one and i got uh went right to you know they have the job centers for us and everything and i just oh so you don t oh and you got transferred to a different right oh boy i worked hard through i went through the J O B s and found this and was versatile enough had a little bit of office experience and they hired me and i was just real thankful and now there s nothing for all the people who are getting laid off now there s just nothing yeah i ve i ve i ve noticed you know i know Colorado Springs has been hit also uh rumors still persist i try not to believe them and listen to them but they still persist that the plant will close i don t know i haven t heard anything i don t hear much about Colorado Springs it s kind of like they re kind of trying to be invisible forget about us forget about us yeah so you re in division what now corporate corporate okay yeah that that must feel somewhat safer i m in in i m in payroll division nine yeah corporate payroll so it didn t for a while there were a lot of rumors flying and uh i still hold a red badge and it s still uh i m still under five years so if they had a layoff in division nine bumping and
