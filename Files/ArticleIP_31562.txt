 Back to Berlin The German press led Friday on the election of Johannes Rau as the country s new president during the last ever meeting of the German parliament in Bonn before its return after more than half a century to Berlin Following the example of the former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl who insisted during the final Bonn session that the re establishment of Berlin as the country s capital doesn t mean that we are turning our backs on the values and basic principles of our constitutional order the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said in a front page comment that the Germans and their politicians don t want any other republic than the one they ve got they want the calm continuation of a national success story after the greatest imaginable catastrophe In an editorial titled Auf Wiedersehen Bonn the Times of London said many people still worry about what Germany might again become once ruled from the harshly beautiful eastward looking centre of Prussian and Nazi military expansion It said The Berlin Reichstag parliament has been rebuilt all glass and mirrors to discourage delusions of grandeur and infuse old Prussian authoritarian style with a taste of Bonn inspired transparency Rule from Bonn is now history But its spirit should live on in Berlin Most British papers led Friday with the failure of the British and Irish prime ministers to resolve a dispute over terrorist disarmament which is threatening the Northern Ireland peace process Despite five days of intensive negotiation in Belfast David Trimble the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party continues to insist that he will not agree to share power with Sinn Fein the political wing of the Irish Republican Army unless the IRA simultaneously starts surrendering its hidden weapons In an analysis of the problem the Financial Times noted that decommissioning is a key element in every peace settlement but that Northern Ireland stands out as a rare case where by contrast for example with Kosovo the issue was not resolved in the early stages of a deal and has been allowed to fester The other big British story Friday was the formal opening by Queen Elizabeth II of Scotland s first national parliament in 300 years She was hailed by the parliament s presiding officer as Queen of Scots the first monarch to be thus addressed since 1707 But the Independent noted a whiff of rebellion in the spontaneous singing by the entire parliament of Robert Burns anti royal ballad A man s a man for a that which favorably compares the ordinary man with Yon birkie ca d a lord Wha struts an stares an a that And the tabloid Daily Express found the queen upstaged by the actor Sean Connery an advocate of full independence for Scotland who received the biggest cheer of the day when he arrived in full

in London to promote the latest volume of his memoirs became the center of a controversy about the interviewing methods of the BBC A column in Thursday s Daily Telegraph strongly attacked Jeremy Paxman one of Britain s best known radio and TV interviewers for being insulting to Kissinger when he asked him if he felt a fraud on receiving the Nobel Prize for bringing peace to Vietnam and whether he waited 17 years to produce these memoirs because he wanted to rewrite history In a letter in self defense published in Friday s Telegraph Paxman wrote It is surely unarguably true that the detente which Dr Kissinger so energetically promoted was built upon the assumption that the Soviet Union would exist for the foreseeable future He now claims it was part of the process which led to the dismantling of the Communist empire The Coca Cola crisis in Belgium last month was due more to a mass psychological problem than to anything wrong with the drink itself according to research
