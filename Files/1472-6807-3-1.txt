 Background Polymerization of ribonucleoside triphosphates NTPs which is central to a variety of crucial biological processes including transcription primer synthesis during DNA replication addition of polyA tails to mRNA addition of CCA to tRNA uridylation in RNA editing replication of RNA viruses amplification of RNA in eukaryotic post transcriptional gene silencing PTGS and oligoadenylate synthesis during interferon signaling is catalyzed by a broad variety of distinct enzymes 1 2 3 4 These polymerases belong to two major mechanistic categories those that copy a nucleic acid template and those that are independent of a template The DNA dependent RNA polymerases DDRPs involved in the transcription of cellular and DNA viral genes primases and RNA dependent RNA polymerases RDRPs of RNA viruses and cellular PTGS systems are template dependent polymerases Template independent RNA polymerases nucleotidyltransferases include CCA adding enzymes polyA polymerases uridylyl transferases and oligoA synthetases Some of the RNA polymerases function as single subunit proteins whereas others form large complexes that consist of multiple distinct subunits however in all known cases the basic catalytic activity maps to a single polypeptide containing a characteristic metal chelating active site 5 6 7 Typically active sites of polymerases contain acidic or polar residues which coordinate divalent metal cations most often Mg 2 The metal cations direct a 5 nucleoside triphosphate to form a phosphoester bond with the 3 hydroxyl of the preceding nucleotide the 3 terminal nucleotide of a growing polynucleotide chain with the elimination of pyrophosphate 6 Despite the basic biochemical similarity among all RNA polymerases sequence and structure comparisons indicate that these enzymes belong to at least five evolutionarily unrelated folds The RDRPs of RNA viruses define one major lineage of nucleic acid polymerases which additionally includes reverse transcriptases archaeo eukaryotic DNA polymerases and nucleotide cyclases 8 9 10 11 12 13 The DNA dependent RNA polymerase of certain bacteriophages such as T7 and the archaeo eukaryotic primase also detected in some bacteria are divergent derivatives of the same fold 11 14 The core catalytic domain of all these enzymes the so called palm domain has an RNA recognition motif RRM like fold with strategically placed metal coordinating residues which form the active site 11 15 16 In contrast bacterial DnaG type primases also present in archaea and some eukaryotes contain a polymerase domain of the Rossmann like TOPRIM fold which is shared with topoisomerases and OLD family nucleases 17 18 19 The recently solved structures of the DDRPs from yeast and the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus indicate that the subunit according to the subunit nomenclature of Escherichia coli DDRP which we hereinafter employ to designate all orthologs of the respective E coli subunits of these enzymes defines another distinct catalytic scaffold which is unrelated to any of the above template dependent RNA polymerases 20 21 22 23 24 Additionally the structural and evolutionary affinities of two other template dependent RNA polymerases namely RDRPs involved in PTGS 25 26 27 and primases of herpesviruses 28 remain obscure In contrast to the template dependent RNA polymerases which have several distinct scaffolds of the catalytic domains all template independent RNA polymerases have the same fold of the principal catalytic domain and belong to the pol superfamily of nucleotidyl transferases 29 30 Thus RNA polymerase activity apparently has been independently invented on several occasions Nevertheless DDRP is one of the most conserved enzymes which is represented without exception in all cellular life forms 31 32 The DDRP complex from most organisms consists of 5 to 15 polypeptides Of these four subunits which correspond to the bacterial and are universally present in all cellular DDRPs and constitute the conserved DDRP core 7 Orthologs of the and subunits are also encoded in the genomes of several families of large eukaryotic DNA viruses 33 34 35 Biochemical studies have shown that the catalytic site of DDRP resides in the subunit and contains three invariant aspartates that coordinate a Mg 2 cation 22 23 24 36 Recent structural analyses demonstrated that the core of DDRP is assembled around the and subunits which interact with each other to form a positively charged nucleic acid binding cleft The subunit further stabilizes this cleft whereas the subunit interacts with the subunit 7 Given their ubiquitous presence in all cellular life forms and high level of sequence conservation it seems evident that the core subunits of this complex RNA synthesis machine were already present in the last universal common ancestor LUCA of the extant cellular life forms and performed functions mechanistically similar to those of modern DDRP In contrast to the ubiquitous DDRP cellular RDRPs that are involved in PTGS so far have been detected only in eukaryotes 1 26 The PTGS phenomenon covers a variety of complementarity dependent silencing pathways such as RNA interference RNAi in animals and slime mold co suppression silencing of transgene and the corresponding endogenous genes and virus gene resistance in plants and quelling in fungi all of which share a common mechanism of RNA turnover 28 37 38 39 40 Essentially double stranded ds RNA which is formed in these processes triggers the activation of a sequence specific RNA degradation system which targets homologous RNAs 41 42 The dsRNA is broken down by the Dicer enzyme into 21 25 nucleotide nt fragments called small interfering RNA or siRNAs 43 44 45 The siRNAs subsequently associate with a complex of proteins called RISC and target homologous RNA by serving as guides for multiple rounds of RNA cleavage 45 46 The RDRP is a component of the PTGS system that has been initially described in plants as a cellular RNA polymerase activity induced upon viral infection that synthesized antisense RNA in a primer dependent or independent manner 26 47 48 49 50 Subsequent genetic studies showed that mutations in RDRP genes impaired PTGS in a variety of systems 25 38 51 52 Experimental studies in C elegans and in plants suggested that the RDRP is involved in production and amplification of dsRNA using the target RNA as template and siRNAs as primers or guides and resulting in amplification of the RNA silencing response 53 54 55 56 The RDRP is present in one or more copies in a wide range of eukaryotes from early branching parabasalids such as Giardia to multicellular forms including fungi plants and animals 57 58 This broad representation in eukaryotes including organisms that are considered primitive suggests that RDRP might have been encoded in the genome of the common ancestor of all modern eukaryotes However this gene has been subsequently lost in several eukaryotic lineages such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae insects and vertebrates Although RDRPs display some diversity in domain architecture and the level of sequence conservation they form a tight well conserved family of large proteins with no detectable prokaryotic or viral homologs Here we investigate the evolutionary history of RDRPs and DDRPs in an attempt to unveil the origin of the RDRP We identify the first homologs of the cellular RDRP outside the eukaryotic clade in bacteriophages and show that RDRPs and DDRPs share a homologous catalytic core which comprises a six stranded double psi barrel DPBB domain Evidence is presented that the ultimate ancestor of RNA polymerases might have been a RNA binding DPBB domain which functioned as a cofactor for a polymerase ribozyme and that subsequent evolution of DDRPs and RDRPs proceeded via accretion of various simple modules such as the sandwich barrel hybrid motif domain around this conserved core Results and discussion Bacteriophage homologs of the eukaryotic RDRPs and prediction of their active site To investigate the evolutionary affinities of the RDRPs we carefully examined the results of BLAST searches of the non redundant NR protein sequence database National Center for Biotechnology Information NIH Bethesda for various RDRP sequences These searches identified a large region of 700 800 residues as the conserved module shared by all RDRPs This region was further examined by searches of NR using the PSI BLAST program which was iterated to convergence with a profile inclusion threshold of E 0 01 These searches e g the search initiated with the core RDRP module from Petunia residues 37 775 readily retrieved RDRPs from plants C elegans Dictyostelium discoideum several fungi and Giardia lamblia with statistically highly significant expectation E values Interestingly the second iteration of this search retrieved the YonO protein from the Bacillus subtilis phage Sp c2 with a significant E value 7 10 3 YonO was also detected with significant E values in searches initiated with other eukaryotic RDRP modules e g that of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Reciprocal searches started with the YonO protein sequence retrieved closely related proteins encoded by prophages in the genome of Clostridium acetobutylicum CAC1139 and Clostridium perfringens CPE1103 Hereinafter we refer to these bacteriophage proteins as the YonO like RDRP homologs YRHs The Gibbs sampling alignment procedure detected 9 statistically significant motifs that are conserved across the entire set of RdRps and YRHs with a probability of occurrence by chance in this set of protein sequences estimated as 10 18 A multiple alignment of the RDRPs and YRHs was constructed using the T Coffee program and adjusted using the alignments reported by PSI BLAST and secondary structure prediction Secondary structure prediction which was produced using the multiple alignment as the query included 16 helices and 20 strands which are conserved in RDRPs and YRHs Fig 1 Conserved sequence motifs are distributed throughout the aligned region two motifs with the highest density of conserved residues are located between strands 8 and 11 and strands 18 and 20 Fig 1 Twelve residues are conserved in all sequences from the two families of which nine are charged and one is polar serine Fig 1 The conserved charged and polar residues conceivably might be involved in catalysis and substrate binding The most notable signature shared by the RDRPs and the YRH proteins is the DbDGD b is a bulky residue motif located between strands 19 and 20 Fig 1 Closely spaced acidic residues that coordinate divalent cations are characteristic of the active sites of most nucleic acid polymerases in spite of the fact that they belong to several unrelated structural folds 9 13 14 17 28 29 59 Given that the DbDGD motif is the only set of closely spaced acidic residues shared by the RDRPs and the YRHs it is likely to form part of the nucleotidyltransferase active site of these enzymes Thus these comparisons identify previously undetected prokaryotic homologs of the eukaryotic RDRPs the YRH proteins which probably also have RNA dependent RNA polymerase activity Structural and evolutionary relationship between the catalytic domains of the RDRPs and the DDRPs Interestingly the PSI BLAST searches started with the sequences of the RDRP module of the RDRPs and the YRH proteins consistently retrieved the subunits of DDRPs albeit at statistically not significant E values The high scoring segment pairs HSPs detected in these searches aligned the highly conserved region of the RDRPs between the predicted strands 18 and 20 including the DbDGD motif with the portion of the DDRP subunit sequence which contains the metal chelating active site with a similar conserved motif DxDGD Additionally a search of the NR database with a position specific scoring matrix PSSM that included all unique RDRP and YRH sequences detected with borderline E values a large protein from Corynebacterium glutamicum Cgl1702 which also contained a DXDGD motif Reciprocal searches showed that this protein contained two regions of statistically significant similarity to the DDRPs The N terminal region of similarity corresponded to the conserved portion of the subunits and the C terminal region corresponded to the core of the subunit and included the DXDGD motif see discussion below Despite the low statistical significance of the similarity between RDRPs and DDRPs the presence of the same signature motif in the experimentally identified or predicted active sites of the two classes of enzymes prompted us to perform a detailed comparison of the catalytic domains of these two classes of RNA polymerases Among nucleic acid polymerases a DxDxD motif is conserved only in the RDRPs the DDRP subunits and the euryarchaea specific DNA polymerase subunit II However in the latter polymerase the motif has the signature DGDED as opposed to the DxDGD pattern shared by the RDRPs and DDRPs To investigate the distribution of this motif in the entire protein database we conducted pattern searches using the GREF program of the SEALS package with queries corresponding to the residue conservation profile in the predicted active sites of the RDRPs All these queries contained the DxDGD motif with additional flanking conserved residues The only proteins with evolutionarily conserved DxDGD motifs that were detected in these searches were the RDRPs the subunit of DDRPs the integrin calcium binding module and the EF hand domain data not shown Among these domains the motif was embedded in the context of conserved predicted strands only in the RDRPs and DDRPs Moreover in searches conducted with extended queries such as DbDGDxhxh or DGDxhxh patterns h is a hydrophobic residue the RDRPs and the subunits of DDRPs were identified as the only protein families in which these motifs were conserved We also ran database searches using the PHI BLAST program that combines a regular BLAST search with a pattern search 60 In these searches the active site motif was used as the pattern query and various RDRP sequences as the sequence queries All these searches retrieved the YonO proteins with significant E values and some of the DDRP subunits with borderline E values For example searches seeded with the RDRP RrpB gene product sequence from Dictyostelium gi 14475571 and the pattern GAS D FLYMQN D G D X ACLIVMFY X ACLIVMFY detected the rice DDRP catalytic subunit with an E value of 0 048 Examination of the recently solved structures of the DDRP showed that although subunit is a large protein the active site containing the DxDGD motif mapped to a small compact barrel domain A search of the PDB database using the DALI program 61 with this barrel from Thermus thermophilus subunit submitted as a query pdb 1iw7 chain D region 625 749 retrieved the N terminal domain of the CDC48 like AAA ATPases formate dehydrogenases aspartate decarboxylases and Barwin The reported structural alignments span 70 residues with significant Z scores 8 8 6 6 and root mean square deviations RMSD between the C backbones in the range of 1 8 2 5 which is characteristic of homologous domains The region of structural similarity shared by the catalytic domain of the subunit of the DDRPs and the above proteins corresponds to a distinct globular fold known as the double psi beta barrel DPBB 62 63 64 The SCOP database included the RNA polymerase subunits in the multidomain protein class but mentions the presence of a DPBB domain in each of the and subunits 65 see below The region of sequence similarity between the RDRPs and the subunits of DDRPs that was detected in the searches described above almost precisely mapped to the DPBB fold catalytic domain of DDRP The multiple alignment based secondary structure prediction for the RDRPs and the YRHs indicated that like the similar region of the subunit this region was enriched in strands Fig 1 Multiple alignment constructed on the basis of sequence alignments produced in the PSI BLAST and PHI BLAST searches and superposition of the predicted secondary structure elements of RDRP and the experimentally determined structure of DDRP revealed considerable concordance between the RDRP and DDRP families In addition to the DbDGD motif which is located in the loop between strands 5 and 6 several residues are conserved between these polymerase families Fig 2 These include hydrophobic residues in the strands a conserved proline after strand 2 a small typically glycine and polar typically aspartate residues before strand 3 small residues that typically mark the boundaries of secondary structure elements and several charged and polar residues Fig 2 A comparison of the RDRP and DDRP sequences using the Gibbs sampling method identified two conserved blocks which were highly statistically significant E 10 16 within the analyzed sequence set One of these blocks centered at the DbDGD motif whereas the other one encompassed strands 3 and 4 which contain several partially conserved hydrophobic and polar positions Fig 2 Importantly approximately 10 conserved residues that are detected in the structure based alignments of the DPBB domains are also conserved in the RDRPs Fig 3 These include a doublet comprised of a small and a polar residues preceding each of strands 3 and 6 a small residue after strand 2 proline in the DDRP subunit and RDRP bulky and polar residues in strand 3 a small residue immediately downstream of strand 5 a bulky residue in the loop between strands 5 and 6 and two hydrophobic residues in strand 6 Fig 3 The predicted DPBB domains of the RDRPs differ from most of the DPBB domains of DDRP subunits in that the former lack a long and variable in both length and sequence insert between strands 2 and 3 that is characteristic of the latter Fig 2 However the DPBB from the RNA polymerases of yeast killer plasmids and the divergent predicted corynebacterial polymerase Cgl1702 also lack this insert Fig 2 Taken together these observations suggest that although RDRPs and the subunits of DDRPs show limited sequence similarity these two RNA polymerase families share a homologous catalytic domain which consists of a double psi barrel containing the metal coordinating DbDGD motif The DPBB domains and early evolution of the catalytic domain of RNA polymerases The SCOP database while classifying the DDRP subunits in the multidomain category recognizes two DPBBs in the DDRP complex One of these corresponds to the catalytic metal coordinating domain containing the DbDGD motif in the subunit residues 626 750 of pdb id 1iw7 chain D whereas the other one corresponds to the conserved core domain of the subunit residues 673 994 of pdb id 1iw7 chain C The DPBB domains of the and subunits interact to form the catalytic cleft of the RNA polymerases with two conserved lysines in the subunit protruding into the cleft and interacting with the substrate Fig 4 However the DPBB domain in the subunit is distorted by two large inserts Fig 4and see below and shows no detectable sequence similarity to the subunit DPBB Because of these inserts and the resulting distortion the DPBB of the subunit does not show similarity to any domains in structure database searches Nevertheless a structural alignment based on visual inspection confirms the presence of all the bona fide features of the DPBB domain in the subunit Fig 3 The Cgl1702 protein from Corynebacterium which we identified as one of the most divergent members of the DDRP clade showed similarity to the other DDRPs only in two regions which corresponded to the DPBBs from the and the subunit This observation taken together with the spatial proximity of the two DPBBs in the catalytic cleft of the DDRP Fig 4 indicates that these domains comprise the ancestral conserved core of the RNA polymerases The arrangement of the two DPBBs in the and subunits suggests that in the primordial ancestor of the DDRPs the two DPBBs formed a head to tail homodimer that bound RNA at the domain interface Although the cores of the two DDRP subunits are homologous and are likely to have evolved from a common ancestor see discussion below they have completely different sets of conserved residues and contribute distinct moieties to the catalytic cleft Figs 3 4 Thus these specific active residues apparently emerged after the divergence of the and subunit DPBBs whereas the ancestral DPBB homodimer probably did not have catalytic activity and merely bound a ribozyme that originally catalyzed the RNA polymerization Subsequently the two subunits diverged from each other with one acquiring a divalent cation binding site in the insert between the two terminal strands of the DPBB whereas the DPBB in the other subunit acquired two basic residues that interacted with the nucleic acid At this stage which might be considered the emergence of modern type RNA polymerases the catalytic activity probably was taken over by the protein The basic DPBB fold consists of six strands and two variable regions which are located after strand 2 and strand 5 and at least in some case adopt a helical conformation 62 63 64 The domain can be further split into two symmetrical structural units each with three core strands These two units are combined into a barrel with a complex topology with strand 5 wedged between strands 1 and 2 and strand 2 wedged between strands 4 and 5 yielding two psi loop structures Fig 4 The psi loops between strands 1 and 2 and between strands 4 and 5 often harbor the active site or substrate interaction residues of the respective DPBBs Sequence comparisons and identification of specific conserved motifs showed that the DPBB fold includes five major superfamilies These superfamilies are typified by the formate dehydrogenase C terminal FDHC domain Barwin endoglucanase aspartyl protease and the DPBB domains from the and subunits of DDRP Two of these superfamilies show a restricted phyletic distribution Barwin like endoglucanases are present only in plants and fungi whereas aspartyl proteases are found in eukaryotes retroviruses and a minority of bacteria The latter superfamily also has a circular permutation which suggests secondary derivation Thus none of these superfamilies are likely to have been present in the last universal common ancestor LUCA of extant life forms In contrast the DPBBs detected in DDRP subunits are universally present in all modern life forms and hence are traceable to LUCA The FDHC superfamily includes several distinct families The N terminal domain of the CDC48 like AAA ATPases is present largely in eukaryotes and archaea and the N terminal domain of thymidine phosphorylases is archaea specific In contrast the FDHC like DPBB domain associated with oxidoreductases such as formate dehydrogenase and molybdopterin containing dehydrogenases is widespread in archaea and all major lineages of free living bacteria Thus at least one DPBB domain of the FHDC superfamily probably was present in LUCA The above analysis shows that LUCA probably encoded three distinct DPBB domains Although the DPBB domain in the RNA polymerase subunit is distorted by inserts and shows extreme sequence divergence its role in the formation of the catalytic cleft and the spatial arrangement with respect to the more canonical DPBB of the subunit Fig 4 are compatible with the hypothesis that the two DPBB domains of DDRP shared a common ancestor to the exclusion of the other ancient FDHC like DPBB A structure based sequence alignment shows that the DPBB domains of the RNA polymerases share several conserved residues with other DPBB domains These include 7 hydrophobic residues two sets of symmetrically positioned small mostly glycine and polar mostly aspartate residues preceding strands 3 and 6 respectively and at least three other small residues two polar residues and two bulky residues Fig 3 Of these the small residues preceding strands 3 and 6 contribute a positive angle which results in turning of the C backbone to stabilize the barrel 62 These shared features notwithstanding the ancient DPBBs have no conserved residues in their catalytic or substrate binding sites This is best compatible with the notion that the common ancestor of the DPBB domains was a generic binding domain devoid of high specificity or catalytic activity see also discussion above The same three stranded structural units that interlock to give rise to DPBB also form another type of barrel via terminal dimerization This is the E longation factor I somerase EI barrel found in ribosomal proteins such as L3 GTPase translation factors ferredoxin reductase and L fucose isomerase 62 66 It seems likely that the EI barrel and the DPBB evolved from ancient three stranded ancestral units which were stabilized via the formation of different barrel structures through homo dimerization Several versions of the DPBB e g those in RNA polymerases and of the EIB such as those in translation elongation factors and ribosomal protein L3 are parts of ribonucleoprotein complexes Other ancient forms especially those that occur as accessory domains in enzymes appear to bind small molecules Hence the primordial three strand unit might have formed barrel shaped dimers that non specifically associated with RNA or with small molecules These generic barrel domains subsequently diverged to occupy different functional niches in ribonucleoproteins and metabolic enzymes These considerations together with the inferred relationships between the different versions of the DPBB domain lead to the scenario of early evolution outlined in Figure 5 Only the last bifurcation of the DPBB domains in the proposed tree yielded the distinct forms present in the and subunits of DDRP which apparently acquired catalytic activity Substantial divergence of the barrels seems to have occurred at a stage of evolution when the actual RNA polymerase activity resided in a ribozyme whose functioning was facilitated by a non specific RNA binding protein cofactor Ancient conserved domains and evolution of DNA dependent RNA polymerases While all bacteria archaea and eukaryotes encode orthologs of at least four distinct subunits of DDRP the divergent RNA polymerases of baculoviruses and yeast killer plasmids and the Corynebacterium Cgl1702 protein only contain counterparts to the and subunits The minimal RNA polymerase seems to be represented by the predicted catalytic core of Cgl1702 which appears to consist entirely of the type and type DPBBs in this case juxtaposed in the same polypeptide These observations are not particularly surprising given that and subunits form the catalytic cleft of the DDRP Fig 3 whereas the other subunits occupy peripheral positions in the complex In an attempt to gain further insight into the early evolution of the catalytic core of RNA polymerases we sought to identify additional globular domains in and subunits Using the experimentally determined structure as a guide we split the and subunits of the Thermus thermophilus DDRP and the largest two subunits of the yeast DDRP into individual globular domains and investigated them by visual inspection of the topology structural searches of the PDB database using the DALI program and iterative searches of the NR database using PSI BLAST An obvious ancient conserved domain thus detected was a rubredoxin like Zn ribbon The Zn ribbons are widespread small domains that are comprised of two hairpins bounded by consecutive extended regions stabilized by metal coordinating residues in the hairpin loops 67 68 69 70 Zn ribbons are present in a variety of nucleic acid binding proteins including several ribosomal proteins translation factors aminoacyl tRNA synthetases RNA polymerase cofactors in archaea and eukaryotes and several transcription factors These domains are also present in other contexts where they function as structural scaffolds and as regulators of redox reactions The subunit of bacterial DDRPs contains a single Zn ribbon at the N terminus region 56 81 of Thermus subunit Fig 6 The orthologous largest subunits of the archaeal and eukaryotic DDRPs have two Zn ribbons in the N terminal portion of the protein regions 59 88 and 103 173 in the yeast protein The distal ribbon is distorted by a large insert between the two core halves of the domain and a substitution of asparagine for one of the metal coordinating cysteines Although the sequences of the Zn ribbons of bacterial and archaeo eukaryotic DDRP subunits have diverged considerably their similar location in the orthologous polypeptides from different kingdoms suggests that subunit of LUCA already contained a Zn ribbon Based on the crystal structure it has been proposed that the region containing the Zn ribbon may interact with the promoter during transcription initiation in bacteria 23 Hence it is plausible that a nucleic acid binding Zn ribbon had been recruited to the ancestral polymerase core which consisted of the DPBB domains and contributed to non specific interactions with the template Consistent with this the Zn ribbon had been subsequently reused in several basal archaeo eukaryotic transcription factors such as TFIIB TFIIE and TFIIS 67 68 71 72 73 A potential additional nucleic acid binding moiety that is conserved in all subunits is the AT hook like module Fig 6 The AT hook is a simple small protein module that consists of a flap like structure with a positively charged surface that is inserted into the minor groove of DNA 74 The two AT hook like modules residues 583 603 of 1IW7 chain D in the DDRP subunit are inserted within the helix that is located immediately upstream of the DPBB domain Fig 6 Previously AT hooks have been detected primarily in eukaryotic chromatin associated proteins particularly transcription factors where they function as accessory DNA binding domains 74 The ubiquity of the AT hook like modules in the subunits of DDRPs suggests that they were recruited for nucleic acid recognition in LUCA if not earlier Analysis of a strand rich insert between strands 2 and 3 of the subunit DPBB Figs 4 6 led to the identification of another ancient conserved domain that could be traced back to ancestral RNA polymerases Visual examination of the structure of this insert domain revealed a topology with elements of both a sandwich and a barrel and two waist like structures that are characteristic of the sandwich barrel hybrid motif SBHM fold 75 76 see also the SCOP database 65 The SBHM fold is present in biotin lipoate carrier domains and their homologs found in a variety of enzymes and transporters 76 A DALI search with this insert domain from the subunit of Thermus DDRP showed similarity to the SBHMs from various biotin lipoate binding enzymes such as acetyl CoA carboxylase 1bdo or dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase 1iyu with Z scores of 6 and RMSD 2 5 in the aligned regions spanning approximately 70 residues An alignment of the SBHM domains from the DDRP subunit with the previously identified SBHMs showed conservation of most residues characteristic of the SBHM superfamily Fig 7 The defining structural feature of this domain is seen in the loop between strands 5 and 6 Figs 7 8 This loop is bounded by small residues at each end mostly valine at the N terminus and glycine at the C terminus and has a distinct signature with small mostly glycine charged mostly aspartate and hydrophobic residues occurring in succession in the middle of the loop Figs 7 8 These observations reveal an evolutionary relationship between the SBHM domain of DDRP and the SBHMs found in other functionally distinct proteins The core SBHM domain consists of a repeat of two three stranded units with the characteristic waist like structure occurring between the second and third strands of each repeat Fig 8 In the complete SBHM strand 1 packs with strand 6 and the loops bounded by the two waist like regions adopt an extended conformation resulting in the formation of a barrel In the crystal structure of DDRP the SBHM domain inserted into the subunit DPBB is in contact with the outward projecting insert between strands 2 and 3 of the subunit DPBB Furthermore the SBHM also contributes to the stabilization of the catalytic site by forming an interface between the two DPBBs Fig 4 The universal presence of the SBHM inserted in the DPBB domain of the DDRP subunit suggests that this domain was already present in the common ancestor of all extant DDRPs The wide spread in different phylogenetic lineages of two other SBHM domains namely those found in dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase and the glycine cleaving enzyme is indicative of their presence in LUCA 76 The SBHM of the DDRPs is specifically related to the biotin lipoate binding SBHMs The two share a conserved basic residue that is present immediately prior to strand 4 In all biotin lipoate binding SBHMs this position is occupied by a lysine which covalently binds organic radical ligands Fig 7 but there is no evidence for such a role in the DDRP subunits These observations suggest that the ancestral SBHM interacted with various ligands with a low specificity From such a precursor which existed prior to LUCA the SBHM domain apparently diversified into two forms one that covalently bound organic radicals and another that specialized in non covalent interactions with proteins or nucleic acids This latter form was recruited into the RNA polymerase catalytic core where it provided additional surfaces for the interaction between the DPBB domains and formed part of the interface between the catalytic domains Thus it appears likely that the ancestral DDRP evolved from the coalescence of at least 3 distinct domains i the DPBB that probably originally bound RNA and subsequently segregated into the cores of the subunit where it acquired the metal coordinating active site and of the subunit with the two lysines projecting into the catalytic cleft Fig 4 ii the Zn ribbon which was probably involved in interactions with the template and iii the SBHM domain that stabilized the interactions between the DPBB domains forming the catalytic cleft Fig 6 Additionally two AT hook like modules which probably had an accessory DNA binding function were also inserted into a conserved helix directly N terminal of the DPBB domain in the subunit The remaining conserved regions in the and subunits of the DDRPs do not show detectable relationship with any other ancient conserved domains Examination of these structures shows that they are principally composed of large helical hairpins that form coiled coil structures or stretches with successive shorter helices Some of the other conserved regions consist of meanders with unusually long strands These regions probably emerged respectively through duplication and divergence of a simple helical unit or through stabilization of long loops by selection for hydrophobic residues resulting in the formation of the core units of the meanders Proliferation of the Sandwich Barrel Hybrid Motif and lineage specific innovations of the large subunits of bacterial DDRP Further visual examination and structural alignments revealed the presence of one additional SBHM domain in the subunit 1iw7 chain C region 592 659 and several repeats of this domain in the subunit 1iw7 chain D regions 163 195 248 308 311 368 369 419 and 1270 1329 of the bacterial DDRPs Fig 6 A PSI BLAST search started with the N terminal SBHM from the Aquifex aeolicus DDRP subunit detected several SBHMs from proteins other than the subunit such as acetylornithine deacetylase E 2 10 7 iteration 2 the C terminal region of bacterial cytochrome F E 10 4 iteration 2 biotin carboxyl carrier domain of biotin transcarboxylases E 6 10 4 iteration 2 and the phosphotransferase system enzyme II E 10 3 iteration 2 This search also retrieved the bacteria specific C terminal SBHM domain of the subunit e g Thermotoga E 10 3 and interestingly also a SBHM in the N terminal region of the NusG protein from Thermotoga maritima E 2 10 7 iteration 2 Reverse searches with the C terminal region of cytochrome F gi 11467387 residues 150 321 retrieved the bacterial sequences in the second and subsequent iterations with statistically significant E values None of these additional SBHMs were detectable in the archaeal or eukaryotic DDRPs either in sequence searches or in direct comparisons of the crystal structures Thus there appears to have been a lineage specific proliferation and dissemination of the SBHM domains in bacteria Bacterial and subunits show major variability in the distribution of the SBHM domains Fig 6 All bacterial subunits share one additional SBHM which is located N terminal of the DPBB domain Similarly an extra SBHM located C terminal of the DPBB is conserved in bacterial subunits In some cyanobacteria the portion of the subunit containing the SBHM occurs as a separate polypeptide In addition to the SBHMs that are conserved among all bacterial lineages a cassette of up to four SBHMs are present N terminal of the DPBB domain in the subunit of Thermus Deinococcus and Thermotoga Fig 6 Similarly the subunit of proteobacteria Aquifex spirochaetes cyanobacteria and chlamydiae contains an additional set of SBHMs C terminal of the DPBB domain preceding the C terminal SBHM that is shared by all bacteria Fig 6 The bacterial specific SBHM domains present in the and subunits are typically located on the periphery of the holoenzyme which makes them accessible for interactions with other proteins Two of these SBHMs regions 163 195 and 369 419 in 1iw7 chain D are involved in the interaction with the 70 subunit which is critical for transcription initiation in bacteria 23 Thus it appears likely that originally the SBHM domain of the subunit participated in generic protein protein interactions that allowed the ancestral DDRP to recruit accessory subunits Subsequently in the bacterial lineage proliferation of SBHMs provided for several other specific interactions involved in initiation and elongation Several of the SBHMs that are specific to the bacterial DDRPs show degradation of the waist like loop of the first internal repeat This is clearly a derived state because the SBHM originally evolved through the duplication of a single ancestral unit that contained an intact waist like loop between strands 2 and 3 The form of the SBHM with a shortened loop in the first internal repeat is additionally seen in several bacterial specific families of SBHMs These include the SBHM of the phosphotransferase system enzyme II glucose permease or PTS EII found in several lineages of free living bacteria the one at the C termini of cytochrome F from cyanobacteria and chloroplasts and the NlpD like cell wall peptidases that are present in most bacteria In addition to the specific structural relationship between some of the SBHMs of the DDRPs and those present in these bacterial proteins they also show detectable sequence similarity For example a PSI BLAST search initiated with the SBHM from NlpD retrieved the derived SBHMs of the bacterial RNA polymerase subunits e g Streptococcus subunit E 10 4 iteration 2 well before the classical SBHMs eg Mesorhizobium dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase E 10 3 iteration 4 The and subunits of the bacterial DDRP are the only proteins that contain both versions of the SBHM Fig 7 Hence it appears likely that the form of the SBHM with the degraded loop in the first internal repeat initially evolved in the bacterial DDRP subunits Subsequently these domains appear to have been recruited for various interactions in other bacterial proteins Examination of the structure and multiple sequence alignments of bacterial and subunits led to the identification of two additional distinct domains which so far are not detectable in any proteins other than the DDRP and were accordingly designated Beta Beta Module 1 BBM1 region 119 165 1iw7 chain D and Beta Beta Module 2 BBM2 region 1109 1190 1iw7 chain D Fig 6 Both these domains share an unusual common structural core that we term the BBM core BBMC of about 40 50 residues with an RMSD of 2 over the aligned region The BBMC consists of N and C terminal helices that bound a central region with 4 unusual extended regions that fold into a curved hairpin structure Fig 9A The BBM1 domain is inserted after the Zn ribbon in all bacterial subunits and additionally into the SBHM domain of the subunit in proteobacteria Aquifex and chlamydiae Fig 6 Notably this is the same set of bacteria that contain extra SBHM domains inserted in the C terminal region of the subunit Fig 6and see above The BBM2 domain shows a similar pattern of insertion the C terminal portion of all bacterial subunit contains one copy Thermotoga has two extra copies distal of the pan bacterial copy Proteobacteria Aquifex spirochetes and chlamydiae have a BBM2 inserted into the N terminal region of the subunit Fig 6 The functions of these previously unnoticed modules and the nature of the apparent congruence in the evolution of the two RDRP subunits in a subset of bacteria remain to be elucidated The RNA polymerase subunit core related domain and other elaborations of the archaeo eukaryotic RNA polymerase catalytic subunits The bacterial DDRPs have two subunits that form a homodimer at the base of the dimer and stabilize the catalytic binding cleft In the archaeo eukaryotic lineage there is a duplication of the subunit resulting in two paralogous subunits RBP3 and RBP11 In the eukaryotic DDRP complex these subunits occupy a spatial position very similar to that of the subunit homodimer of the bacterial DDRPs All these proteins share a common core domain with two helices which form the dimer interface In the SCOP database the subunit core domains have been classified together with several other domains including the ligand binding domain of the bacterial arginine repressor the dimerization cofactor of the transcription factor HNF1 DCOH and a domain specific to the bacterial aspartyl tRNA synthetases To investigate this domain further we conducted structural similarity searches of the PDB database using the DALI program with the subunits of the bacterial and eukaryotic DDRPs used as the queries These searches showed that the core domain of the subunits were most similar Z scores 5 4 7 with RMSDs of 2 2 3 over the aligned C residues to the arginine repressor ligand binding domain 77 and several domains that were not previously recognized as being related Fig 9B These newly detected domains included the SUI1 domain that is found in eIF1 and related proteins 78 the third globular domain of DNA gyrase Topoisomerase II and most interestingly a distinct globular domain in the yeast DDRP subunit PDB 1k83 region 1143 1271 Reciprocal DALI searches with these domains readily recovered the subunits of DDRP as the best hits For example the domain from the yeast subunit hit the subunits of bacterial DDRPs with Z scores of 5 7 and RMSD of 2 8 3 Hereinafter we refer to these domains as the subunit core related ASCR domains The ASCR fold has a 2 2 topology and forms a two layered structure with a 4 stranded sheet and characteristic strand order of 1 2 4 3 Fig 9B The ASCR domains of bacterial subunits and eukaryotic RBP3 share a common insert domain between helix 1 and strand 3 which apparently has been lost in the RBP11 subunit of the eukaryotic DDRPs The ASCR domain in the yeast subunit is inserted into another domain Visual examination of the topology and structural searches of the PDB database using the DALI program showed that this domain it adopts an RNA Recognition Motif RRM like structure with a 2 topology forming a 4 stranded sheet These two domains comprise a conserved module that is specifically shared by the archaeo eukaryotic DDRPs to the exclusion of the bacterial subunits Fig 6 This two domain module is inserted precisely in the same region as the C terminal SBHMs seen in the bacterial lineage Fig 6 The closest relatives of the ASCR domain detected in the subunit are those present in the subunits Fig 9B This observation suggests that the primary event in the divergence of the archaeo eukaryotic subunit was the insertion of an RRM like domain into the ancestral core This was followed by the insertion of the ASCR domain which probably evolved as a result of a duplication of the RBP3 11 subunits into this RRM like domain Both the spatial arrangement of the ASCR domain in the subunits and its extreme sequence divergence with respect to the ASCR domains of the subunit suggests that it has acquired a new function The RRM like domain and the ASCR domain are positioned in the exterior entrance to the catalytic cleft and could interact with cofactors or with nucleic acid There is no evidence that the ASCR domain in the DDRP subunits binds nucleic acids and studies on SUI1 protein and the arginine repressor ligand binding domain implicate the ASCR domain in protein protein interactions and small molecule binding 77 79 However most of the ASCR domains are present in proteins that interact with nucleic acids see above raising the possibility of a role in non specific nucleic acid binding Mirroring the insertion of the ASCR domain in the subunit a distinct globular domain N terminal to the DPBB domain region 578 632 of 1K83 Chain B is inserted in the subunits of all archaeal and eukaryotic DDRPs Fig 6 This domain contains a 4 stranded sheet with a 2 2 topology with the strands in a 2 1 4 3 order Visual examination of the topology and searches of the PDB database using the DALI program showed that this insert domain has the grasp fold 80 81 For example in the DALI search the Staphylococcus immunoglobulin binding protein IGBP PDB code 2igd was detected with a Z score of 5 2 and a RMSD of 2 7 over 50 residues This insert domain in the archaeo eukaryotic subunits resembles the version of the grasp domain that is present in the bacterial translation initiation factor IF3 and the IGBPs in contrast to the distinct version found in ubiquitins ferredoxins and ThiS Specifically the subunit insert domain shares a 4 stranded core with the former group and like these proteins lacks a long insert between the two terminal strands data not shown Given that this domain lies in the periphery of the holoenzyme it is likely to participate in interactions with cofactors which is compatible with the protein protein interaction function identified in several proteins with the grasp fold 80 81 Thus a common set of ancient conserved modules appears to have been repeatedly reused in the evolutionary diversification of the RNA polymerase subunits from their ancestral cores The lineage specific domain insertions in bacteria and in archaea eukaryotes correlate with the fundamental differences between the basal transcription machinery of these two lineages 82 83 This suggests congruent evolution of the RNA polymerase catalytic subunits and the basal transcription factors 68 Origin of the RDRPs The evidence of an evolutionary relationship between the core catalytic domains of the RDRPs and the DDRPs has implications for the origin of the former group of proteins Given that DDRP is universal whereas RDRP is eukaryote specific a plausible hypothesis might be that RDRP evolved at the onset of eukaryotic evolution through extensive rapid sequence divergence following a duplication of the subunit of the ancestral DDRP However despite extensive comparisons using PSSM and careful visual examination we failed to detect any residual sequence similarity between DDRP and RDRP outside the core DPBB domain containing the metal binding active site In particular no traces of the Zn ribbon and the AT hook like modules which are conserved in all subunits Fig 6 were detected All RDRP sequences contain two closely spaced lysines which are conserved in the YRH proteins Fig 1 and might functionally correspond to the conserved lysines of the type DPBB These residues are embedded in a secondary structure context that is enriched in predicted strands Fig 1 hence in principle this region might correspond to the type DPBB of the DDRPs However the respective region of the RDRP sequences shows no detectable similarity to the to this DPBB domain suggesting that the presence of two functionally important lysines in both RDRP and DDRP might be convergent In principle radical divergence could have eroded all similarity between RDRP and DDRP beyond the DPBB domain An alternative perhaps more likely explanation is that while the core catalytic domains of the two polymerases evolved from the same ancestral DPBB they subsequently accreted distinct sets of peripheral modules around this core The bacteriophage YRH proteins show no specific relationship with the RDRPs from any one eukaryotic lineage arguing against a recent lateral transfer from eukaryotes to the phages Taken together all these observations point to a scenario for the origin of the RDRP under which the RDRPs and the YRHs diverged from the DDRPs at a stage of evolution that succeeded the divergence of the DPBB domains of the and subunits Fig 5 but preceded the emergence of eukaryotes and even LUCA One class of substrates of the extant eukaryotic RDRPs are small RNAs such as microRNAs and stRNAs 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 and analogous small RNAs have been identified in bacteria 91 92 93 94 Given that small RNAs are likely to have been abundant in the hypothetical ancient RNA world RDRPs might have been involved in the replication of such RNAs since an early stage of evolution Should that be the case the YRH proteins could be late surviving derivatives of these ancient enzymes which apparently have been shunned from cellular life forms during the evolution of prokaryotes Eukaryotes might have acquired the YRH gene from a bacteriophage at an early stage of their evolution and retained the RDRPs thanks to the selective advantage conferred by the new level of gene expression regulation mediated in part by these enzymes The eukaryotic RDRP is part of a large ensemble of functionally linked proteins which include the Dicer helicase nuclease PIWI family proteins the Hen 2 Corymbosa like RNA methylase AlkB related RNA demethylases and Lin28 like RNA binding proteins 1 45 46 Since no closely related homologs of any of these proteins are encoded in the genomes of the phages that encode YRH proteins the latter are unlikely to function in a biological context similar to that of the eukaryotic RDRPs Nevertheless the extended similarity between the YRH and RDRP sequences and the presence of potential nucleic acid binding modules such as a C terminal Zn ribbon in the Sp C2 YonO protein suggest that the YRH proteins also have a RNA polymerase activity Possible functions of the YRH proteins include a regulatory activity via amplification of antisense RNAs or perhaps a more conventional role as a DNA dependent RNA polymerase of the respective phages General discussion and conclusions Here we identified bacteriophage homologs of the eukaryotic RDRP which is involved in post transcriptional gene silencing We also present evidence that RDRP and the ubiquitous subunit of DDRP contain a homologous metal coordinating catalytic domain This domain adopts the DPBB fold in which the signature DbDGD motif shared by RDRP and DDRP is ensconced in the insert between the ultimate and penultimate strands A second DPBB domain is present in the subunit of the DDRPs This version of the DPBB domain lacks the metal coordinating motif but contributes two lysine residues which are critical for substrate interactions in the catalytic cleft The DPBB domain in the subunit is distorted by large inserts and shares no detectable sequence similarity with the DPBB from the subunit However the DPBBs from the two DDRP subunits are spatially juxtaposed in the DDRP crystal with the catalytic cleft located between them This arrangement suggests that the primordial RNA polymerase was a head to tail homodimer of a DPBB domain a duplication of this primordial DPBB domain probably gave rise to the two DPBBs of modern DDRPs The presence of completely different conserved residues and the asymmetric head to tail arrangement of the monomers in the pair suggest that the ancestral DPBB dimer was not specialized had no catalytic activity and merely bound RNA Originally these DPBB domains might have functioned as protein cofactors that stabilized a ribozyme RNA polymerase and eventually displaced the ribozyme as they acquired key residues required for protein based polymerase activity This evolutionary scenario complements a similar model proposed for the evolution of the other major polymerase class the palm domain containing RNA and DNA polymerases whose primordial core apparently consisted of a RNA binding domain of the RRM fold 11 The and subunits of DDRP additionally contain a Zn ribbon and a SBHM domain respectively The former is a widespread nucleic acid binding domain whereas the latter functions in a variety of biochemical contexts as a small molecule binding and protein protein interaction domain Analysis of the conserved protein superfamilies within these folds and their phyletic distribution patterns suggests that diverse versions of these domains with distinct functions were already present in LUCA Thus several duplication divergence events apparently preceded the emergence of the forms of these domains that are seen in the catalytic core of DDRPs e g Fig 5 The ancestral versions of these domains would not have the adaptations for specific roles possessed by their descendant forms such as those in extant DDRP or RDRP and probably functioned as generic RNA binding and protein protein interaction domains with the specificity conferred by catalytic RNA molecules Hence considerable diversity of protein domains appears to have emerged prior to the crystallization 95 of a transcription machinery similar to the one that operates in modern cells and probably had been already in place in LUCA 96 Similar conclusions regarding the early stages of protein domain evolution have been reached previously as a result of evolutionary analysis of proteins involved in translation such as aminoacyl tRNA synthetases and GTPases substantial diversification of protein domains had occurred prior to the crystallization of elaborate modern type translation machinery 66 97 Although the major events in the evolution of polymerases occurred at very early stages of evolution and LUCA already had an advanced DDRP resembling the extant forms subsequent lineage specific elaborations of considerable magnitude have occurred The most notable of these is the proliferation and dissemination of SBHM and the BBM domains in the bacterial and subunits In the archaeo eukaryotic lineage another domain apparently derived through duplication of the dimerization domain of the DDRP subunit was inserted into the C terminal region of the subunit Additionally the Zn ribbon underwent duplication and elaboration in the subunit and was also recruited in various transcription factors Similarly in the archaeo eukaryotic subunit a minimal grasp domain was added to the conserved core While we provide evidence that the catalytic cores of the RDRPs their bacteriophage homologs and the DDRPs evolved from a common ancestor the provenance of the rest of the conserved RDRP module and accordingly the evolutionary scenario for RDRP remain less clear No similarity to DDRPs was detected in the RDRP sequences beyond the core DPBB domain One possibility is that the RDRP module has emerged at the onset of the evolution of eukaryotes through extreme sequence divergence following a duplication of the DDRP subunit An alternative scenario holds that the RDRPs are ancient enzymes that diverged from the evolutionary precursor of DDRP at a very early pre LUCA stage of evolution albeit after the duplication that led to the differentiation of the and versions of the DPBB domain In fact it appears likely that the ancestral protein RNA polymerase at the time of the differentiation of the type and type DPBB domains functioned as an RDRP because DNA probably had not evolved by that stage 96 The switch of the ancestral enzyme to the DDRP activity and the emergence of the evolutionary precursor of RDRP might be tentatively linked to one another and associated with the advent of DNA This view of the evolutionary history of RDRPs is compatible with the presence of RDRP homologs in phages and with their role in replicating microRNAs potential relics of the RNA world during PTGS in eukaryotes Subsequently this enzyme apparently has been expunged from the cellular RNA synthesis systems and survived only in some parasitic elements such as bacteriophages through which it might have been reintroduced into the genome of an ancestral eukaryote This scenario shows parallels to the probable evolutionary history of another major unrelated class of polymerases the RDRPs and reverse transcriptases containing the palm domain Among extant biological entities these polymerases are encoded largely by RNA viruses and retroid viruses but a reverse transcriptase had been recruited by eukaryotes as the catalytic subunit of the telomerase 98 99 There seems to be a distinct possibility that both classes of RDRPs are vestiges of the ancient RNA world that have been largely displaced from cellular biochemical machinery at an early stage of evolution because of the deleterious effects of RNA replication in DNA based organisms while surviving in selfish genetic elements Material and Methods The non redundant NR database of protein sequences National Center for
