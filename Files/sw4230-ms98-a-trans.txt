        well Lynn what do you think should elderly be cared for in the home or do you think theyre always better off in a nursing home or are there any answers to something like that     well there certainly are times when uh its necessary i believe to place someone in a nursing home um that uh person just becomes too expensive and too um hard on the family to care for somebody within their home but uh i think everything possible should be done to uh keep someone at home before that happens   yeah well my my mother whos seventy is has living with her my eighty nine year old grandmother   oh my   and oh theyre doing fine so far   oh thank goodness   but uh   does your mother have any help   it no no and and my grandmothers pretty selfsufficient uh she did have a mini stroke recently which is left her just a tiny bit addled but i dont think shes any place close to needing a nursing home   no i i think its only when a person becomes uh my father had to be placed eventually in a nursing home he had uh Alzheimers disease   oh how sad   yeah its um and it was just impossible to care for him uh twenty four hours a day um   yeah   but uh and there werent enough um resources i think in the community to help uh my mother care for him   umhum   which was really unfortunate   yes   i think it it it the placement could have been delayed had there been um more resources in their community   that must have been very difficult for her to make that decision   oh it it was and uh i think she she was there every every day uh at noon and at night to make sure that he was fed and cared for in a proper way and it was exhausting   i think one of the the toughest parts about the decision would be finding the home uh i know in Texas we hear so many of so many abuses in nursing homes that its just i dont know where youd start   he well i think you know the first thing is just to look at  lots of them and then it it does make a difference if there are regular visits by family um that uh the staff you know is aware that they cant be neglecting somebody if the familys there everyday   yeah   um and i i must say i have some sympathy for the nursing home staff itself they you they are overworked   oh yes and probably underpaid in a lot of cases i mean i think thats treated as pretty much unskilled labor   uh certainly yes its doesnt have um uh its not compensated adequately and the um and theres certainly no prestige attached to uh um you know its sort of a yeah its its its a sad situation   yeah i wonder if the church run nursing homes in general are better than the others   i think any uh nonprofit facility is probably better run than uh those institutions that are strictly for profit uh so that means often that they are church run   yeah   but um   my late inlaws lived at Leisure World uh for a number of years but i actually they moved away from there with a daughter before they needed the final care i guess it had graduated levels of care or something in that facility i dont know if youre familiar with that or not its in Southern California   oh yeah actually i um my my work is to advise families in finding care for their elders and sometimes that means getting in all kinds of community resources to the home whether its MealsonWheels or uh home help aids or whatever but when somebody is looking for care i recommend that they look for something thats uh has more than one level   umhum   that its not just an independent living facility
