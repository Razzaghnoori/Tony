 John McCain Hollywood s Darling Harry I hear you on Putin I guess Sandy Berger and the Clintonites are clinging to the fact that the new Russian prez worked with the liberal mayor of St Petersburg in the late 80s but that doesn t seem so comforting Hey at the end of the day it s Uganda with nukes Can you imagine who we d turn to if our country was one tenth as screwed up as theirs I was boning up for our Yeltsin coverage over the weekend and read that their GDP has shrunk 43 percent since 1990 We have a recession for a few months in which the GDP barely dips and we seriously consider handing the country over to Ross Perot Yeah the Yeltsin farewell was truly bizarre Besides his halting tone that shot of him at an unusually wide table with a feeble Christmas tree behind him added to the whole Madame Tussaud effect Hey don t get me wrong on Peanuts I m basically a Simpsons kind of guy Irony ber alles But Peanuts did have a sophisticated side beyond the Met Life crap After all the cartoon was inhabited by self doubters Charlie Brown Linus Peppermint Pattie and narcissists Lucy Snoopy which made it a lot more nuanced than say Blondie or Beetle Bailey All discussions of comedy are invariably lame so I ll stop here but suffice it to say I m still sniff sniff hurting a bit On Capra vive la diff rence but I m a fan again not because of its cheerfulness but because of its dark side On another topic Does Hollywood love McCain Washington is still romancing the guy in a way that makes previous presidential infatuations Tsongas Babbitt Anderson look like spin the bottle I thought I saw something about how Geffen liked him even though he s backing Gore Can Tom Hanks be far behind I ve dealt with McCain some and I m not impervious to the charm either Part of it I think beyond his much remarked upon candor or campaign finance support is the fact that he s so at peace about Vietnam unlike the rest of the country He jokes about it he supported recognition of Hanoi he doesn t piss on those who didn t serve He s walking talking absolution for the rest of us That s not a bad calling card Best Matt
