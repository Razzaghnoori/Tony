 Is The Kiss Really So Awful I blurbed The Kiss The book scared me not because it concerns incest or happens to be true but because of the malign figure of the father who reminded me of the character played by Robert Mitchum in The Night of the Hunter I also appreciated the drugged cadence of the prose with a chasm between every two sentences and the frozen stare of the insistent present tense I know Kathryn and Colin Harrison having encountered them professionally and socially we live in the same neighborhood but literary New York is a small town anyway but I don t know them well enough for it to carry gossip value I judged The Kiss as a book Obviously I was well aware of the holy shit factor sufficiently high that it could swamp all discussion and become the sole focus of criticism But I naively underestimated its effect imagining a bunch of dumb reviews and one or two hand wringing op ed pieces Instead came a flood of both with a tone that rose from shrill to vindictive People went out of their way to attack not just the book some candidly admitted they hadn t bothered to read it but Harrison personally and her husband her agent and her publishers for good measure Bad publicity is better than none of course but after a time you could no longer ignore an odor of smoke and it wasn t your usual book chat roast It began to seem like a witch trial Harrison has been accused of being a liar an opportunist a traitor to all segments of her family an unfit mother to have written the book solely for the money or the attention everything short of having fucked her father in order to write about it The Kiss has been called slimy repellent meretricious cynical by Jonathan Yardley in the Washington Post and things to that effect by sundry others The New Republic s teaser triumphantly reads James Wolcott Smacks Kathryn Harrison in the Kisser No tort is too trivial for the prosecutors Take self plagiarism a well documented failing among writers of all sizes In Harrison s case it became the centerpiece of a multiple count indictment handed down by Michael Shnayerson in the February Vanity Fair the fallout of which was that The New Yorker killed a scheduled excerpt The publisher attempting damage control rushed the book into stores two months before the publication date Self plagiarism is usually a consideration for critics not feature writers a textual weakness not a matter of morals There s no question that the book is a long way from perfect But literary matters are not of much interest to the peanut gallery self plagiarism is an exception because it sounds like a crime Comment has instead tended to focus on familial betrayal dubious motives and the moral sink that is the memoir today There are those who fret about the effect on her two young children While this is reasonable it is worth noting that Harrison has said she wanted to publish the book now before our children were any older and more aware of the media around them She has a point The dogs bark the caravan passes The furor will be over long before the kids are able to understand it the spotlight would only be harsher if they were older and the subject itself would either come up or be repressed to everyone s detriment Some people are worried that Harrison s father is still alive the book could hurt him These tend to be the same people who describe the relationship as consensual a word that could not occur to anyone who has read the book Of course there are men who seem to think that rape is a sex act rather than an act of violence But the very notion of incest the last taboo unhinges readers and they transfer blame onto Harrison in effect accusing her of having engineered her own defilement Shnayerson calls the book s sexual inexplicitness either proper or a tease Besides blaming the victim this attitude is also provincial and illiterate if not disingenuous We re sitting at the tail end of the century of William Burroughs and Georges Bataille and The Story of O a century in which literature would seem to have shed its last gratuitous prohibitions It is also a century in which father daughter incest continues all around and not just up in the hills But you d think judging from the press that recent authors of memoirs had called incest or alcoholism or any number of species of abuse into being by writing about them When the reaction is not faux na f it is censorious Shut up and sublimate Practitioners of self exposure are many these days of course and none of them is Jean Jacques Rousseau Literature might be better served if rage or remorse were diverted into parlor comedy Who knows Again that isn t the point for many of your bien pensants who fear mess and complication more than they care about the state of literature Aknow nothing cynicism is pervasive now Everybody wants the inside scoop the shoddy truth that lies at the core of all decisions Accordingly it is widely believed that books are always planned and written with marketing in mind Fortunately or not though calculation usually results in failure and for most writers the foolproof concept that briefly shone at conception looks like a mirage within three days at the keyboard Also underfoot is the venerable cousin Don theory of literature you know You re a writer You should meet my cousin Don He s got a story that will make you both rich The can t miss story is the Northwest Passage of letters a myth There are only 36 possible plot situations as 18 th century playwright Carlo Gozzi determined and we already know them all And then there is the vexed question of memoir vs novel Critics are as frantic about saving their novel these days as they were about killing it 40 years ago Their panic is reminiscent of the moral defenses of painting that were worked up when photography began to look like a threat That debacle should have taught the world that media can coexist and that artists can even migrate between them depending on the flavor they seek The analogy is imperfect because there s no fixed line of demarcation between fiction and nonfiction only a broad gray field And anyway who cares whether your kitchen sink epic features short fat Mom and Dad or tall thin contract players As Andr Breton wrote of fictionalization of actual events I do not regard such a thing as childish I regard it as monstrous I insist on knowing the names on being interested only in books left ajar like doors I will not go looking for keys Fiction has its glories but concealment is merely squalid Kathryn Harrison s status as voodoo doll has nothing to do with the actual merits or failings of her book but is entirely owing to how economically her case concentrates the fears resentments misconceptions and idiocies prevailing right now It also reflects the fact that most cultural journalists are under constant pressure whether from above or from within to whip up instant controversies tied to some product on the shelf They re over quickly and forgotten by all except perhaps their often hapless targets In the meantime they don t tend to elevate discourse
