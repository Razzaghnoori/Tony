 Background The dorsal horn of the spinal cord plays important roles in sensory information processing The dorsal horn contains the neural circuitry conveying nociceptive information including pain and temperature from the periphery by the primary afferents 1 2 3 Nociceptive afferent fibers terminate predominately in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord Activation of the nociceptors transmits afferent messages to the spinal cord dorsal horn through neurotransmitters such as glutamate Initial processing of nociceptive information occurs in the spinal cord dorsal horn by excitatory and inhibitory interneurons The projecting neurons spinalthalamic tract cells then convey primary nociceptive information to higher centers signaling localization and encoding the character of the nociceptive input Other inputs related to the subjective components of pain and related to motor and autonomic control are also relayed to higher centers The projection neurons of the dorsal horn also activate the descending control system which in turn controls the gain of dorsal horn neurons either through excitatory or inhibitory mechanisms In this manner the initial nociceptive information may be further modulated by signals descending from higher centers 1 2 3 The dorsal horn can be subdivided into six distinct laminae on the basis of the cytological features of its resident neurons 2 4 Classes of primary afferent neurons that convey distinct modalities terminate in distinct laminae of the dorsal horn Thus there is a close correspondence between the functional and anatomical organization of the neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord Nociceptive neurons are mostly located in the superficial dorsal horn in the marginal layer lamina I and in the substantia gelatinosa lamina II and receive direct synaptic input from A and C fibers Laminae III and IV are located ventral to the substantia gelatinosa and contain neurons that receive monosynaptic input from A fibers Lamina V primarily contains wide dynamic range neurons that project to the brain stem and to regions of the thalamus These neurons receive monosynaptic input from A and A fibers They also receive input from C fibers either directly on their dendrites or indirectly via interneurons Many neurons in lamina V also receive nociceptive input from visceral structures Neurons in lamina VI receive input from large diameter afferents from muscles and joints and respond to nonnoxious manipulations of joints These neurons are thought not to contribute to the transmission of nociceptive messages Consistent with the important role of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord in pain transmission and modulation neurochemical studies have implicated an enriched expression of neurotransmitters neuropeptides ion channels and receptors in these neurons including substance P enkephalin CGRP somatostatin and GABA The morphology of primary afferent central terminals dorsal horn neurons and descending systems together with their chemical neuroanatomy synaptic arrangements transmitter systems and functional properties have been extensively documented 1 2 3 4 5 However the molecular chemical neuroanatomy of the dorsal horn is a subject that is constantly being revised and updated as improved techniques reveal new insights into classical pathways or substances that are localized in the spinal cord In this study we performed a large scale screening for genes that are enriched in the dorsal spinal cord In addition to molecules that are known to be highly expressed in the dorsal spinal cord we identified other neuropeptides ion channels and signaling molecules enriched in the dorsal spinal cord We then further characterized the cellular localization of a subset of these genes in the spinal cord as well as the regulation of a subset of the genes in a neuropathic pain model Results Global identification of genes that are enriched in the dorsal spinal cord using DNA microarray analysis In order to identify genes that are enriched in the dorsal spinal cord we took advantage of DNA microarray technology which is powerful in identifying regional specific gene expression We screened globally for genes that are expressed at higher levels in the dorsal spinal cord as compared to the ventral spinal cord A total of 9 rats were used in this study Dorsal spinal cord and ventral spinal cord are separated by cutting through the central cannel Dorsal spinal cord samples from 3 rats were pooled and ventral spinal cord samples from the same 3 rats were pooled to form each pair of samples RNA was prepared from 3 such pairs of samples each was analyzed by hybridization with a Affymetrix chip RG U34A which contains 8799 probesets Using the SAFER analysis approach see methods we compared gene expression between the dorsal and ventral spinal cord samples using a paired t test and analysis of variance ANOVA Using a paired t test we found 31 probesets with p value smaller than 0 05 and greater than 2 fold higher expression in the dorsal spinal cord Table 1 An ANOVA analysis detected 30 of these 31 probesets along with 21 additional probesets that met these criteria We found evidence in the literature for enriched expression in the dorsal spinal cord of 23 genes among the 51 genes detected by ANOVA Table 1 In addition we independently tested the expression of 7 genes by QRT PCR 2 genes by in situ hybridization and 2 genes by immunohistochemistry All but one of these genes were confirmed to be enriched in the dorsal spinal cord Both paired t test and ANOVA analysis detected genes that are enriched in the dorsal spinal cord as revealed by independent confirmation As ANOVA analysis provides more candidate genes we chose to subsequently present the results based on ANOVA analysis The 51 genes that are expressed higher in the dorsal spinal cord represent several functional categories including neuropeptides ion channels receptor and signaling molecules calcium calmodulin binding proteins transcription factors synaptic proteins and others Table 2 Neuropeptide genes are among the category that have the highest number of genes expressed specifically in the dorsal spinal cord These include somatostatin protachykinin beta tachykinin neuropeptide Y NPY neurokinin B and nociceptin In addition we also detected another peptide C type natriuretic peptide CNP which is expressed at 2 fold higher levels in the dorsal spinal cord A number of ion channels were found to be expressed higher in the dorsal spinal cord including voltage gated sodium channel type VI SCAN6A a putative four repeat ion channel NMDA receptor NR1 and potassium channel Kv3 1 A few G protein coupled receptors such as cannabinoid receptor GABA B R2 receptor and olfactory receptor like protein SCRD 9 as well as molecules important in signaling such as Galpha olf Guanine nucleotide releasing factor and CAM kinase I beta 2 CAM kinase II beta and PKC beta were also identified to be expressed more in the dorsal spinal cord We found that the dorsally enriched genes also include several members of the calcium sensor protein family such as vesicle associated calcium calmodulin binding protein CAMK IV homolog PKC substrate neurogranin chromogranin neurovisinin like protein secretogranin and hippocalcin In addition several transcription factors and synaptic proteins were also expressed higher in the dorsal spinal cord Table 2 QRT PCR confirmation of genes enriched in the dorsal spinal cord We sought to confirm the differential gene expression of a selected subset of genes in the spinal cord along the dorsal ventral axis using QRT PCR The genes selected showed expression differences between 2 to 7 fold by DNA microarray We compared gene expression between dorsal and ventral spinal cord samples And the results of these comparisons are depicted in Fig 1 In general higher expression was confirmed for 6 out of the 7 genes tested in the dorsal spinal cord despite some degree of variation among the 3 pairs of samples from different animals Fig 1 We confirmed the enriched expression of the following genes a transcription factor NGFI A a putative four repeat ion channel a vesicle associated calcium calmodulin binding protein that is homologous to CAMK IV a neuronal calcium sensor protein hippocalcin synuclein beta and an EST gene The Zinc finger protein mRNA was found to be only marginally enriched in the dorsal spinal cord Fig 1 Cellular expression of dorsal spinal cord enriched genes Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry we sought to investigate whether differences in gene expression as detected by DNA microarray reflect differences at the cellular level In situ hybridization revealed that PKC substrate neurogranin and vesicle associated calcium calmodulin binding protein CAMK IV homolog mRNA are both highly enriched in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord Fig 2 Neurogranin expression seems to be enriched in subsets of the cells of lamina II and III Fig 2A similar to PKC localization Fig 3C CAMK IV homolog seems to be broadly expressed in layers I III of the dorsal horn Fig 2B Immunohistochemistry with antibodies against Galpha olf syntaxin 1A and PKC revealed that these proteins are also enriched in the dorsal spinal cord Fig 3 Galpha olf and Syntaxin 1A appear to be localized in the neuropil of the dorsal horn Fig 3Aand 3B whereas PKC appears to be expressed in layer IIi of the dorsal horn Fig 3C as previously described 6 Regulation of dorsally enriched genes in a chronic neuropathic pain model We sought to study whether the genes that are enriched in the dorsal spinal cord are regulated during a persistent pain state such as the spinal nerve ligation SNL model of neuropathic pain For a subset of genes enriched in the dorsal spinal cord we used QRT PCR to compare the gene expression in the lumbar spinal cord between spinal nerve ligation rats and rats subjected to sham surgery and to compare expression between ipsilateral and contralateral sides separated by cutting through the midline in the segment of lumbar spinal cord in spinal nerve ligation rats In general we found that genes that are enriched in the dorsal spinal cord are not among those found to be up regulated in the spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain Table 3 Discussion Validation of microarray data The reliability of these DNA microarray results is demonstrated by the following three observations 1 A subset of the genes was observed to be consistently regulated by multiple probesets on the microarray 2 We detected 21 genes by 23 probesets which have previously been described to be enriched in the dorsal spinal cord 3 Genes that we chose to study further were confirmed to be expressed higher in the dorsal spinal cord by QRT PCR 6 out of 7 in situ hybridization 2 out of 2 and immunohistochemistry 2 out of 2 Based on the consistency and the rate of independent confirmation many of the genes listed in the tables are likely to be true positives We note that our list of dorsal spinal cord enriched genes is likely to be incomplete since the Affymetrx DNA microarrays do not represent the entire rat genome and our study may not have been sensitive enough to discover all the genes especially those that are expressed at low levels Toward a molecular anatomy of the spinal cord particularly in the pain sensory pathways We found that some genes are expressed in a lamina specific manner while others may have a gradient of expression Neurogranin is highly enriched in the superficial laminae PKC has been demonstrated to be expressed in lamina IIi The colocalization of neurogranin and PKC in similar regions in the spinal cord suggests that neurogranin may be an endogenous substrate of PKC in the spinal cord Neurogranin has been shown to be phosphorylated by PKC and this phosphorylation is greatly decreased in PKC knockout mice suggesting neurogranin is a PKC specific substrate 9 Evidence that strongly suggests the phosphorylation of neurogranin plays an important role in neural plasticity comes from the studies that demonstrated neurogranin knockout mice show essentially the same deficits in behaviors related to learning and memory as that of the PKC knockout mice 10 Neurogranin is not only a substrate of PKC but also plays a important role in regulating PKC signaling 11 Interstingly PKC knockout mice demonstrate reduced neuropathic pain 12 Similar to neurogranin we found that a calmodulin binding vesicle associated CAM kinase IV like protein is highly expressed and enriched in the superficial layer of the dorsal spinal cord The function of this gene is not yet known However the protein was also found to be enriched in forebrain neurites 13 Using immunostaining we found that Syntaxin 1A and Galpha olf proteins were enriched in the dorsal spinal cord Syntaxin 1A has previously been shown to be preferentially expressed in the dorsal spinal cord neuropil Galpha olf is a G protein that was initially found to be expressed in the olfactory epithelium The Galpha olf has been shown to be specifically expressed in the striatum in the brain and was found to colocalize with and activated by adenosine A 2A receptors 14 It is possible that the specific expression of Galpha olf in the dorsal spinal cord implies its mediation of functions for specific G protein coupled receptors in these neurons Conclusions 1 We conducted a large scale screening using DNA microarray for genes that are specifically expressed in the dorsal spinal cord We found additional neuropeptides receptors ion channels and signaling molecules to be enriched in the dorsal spinal cord 2 The regulation of a subset of the genes was confirmed by QRT PCR Six out of the seven genes were confirmed to be enriched in the dorsal spinal cord 3 In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed that neurogranin CAMK IV homolog Galpha olf and Syntaxin 1A are indeed enriched in the dorsal spinal cord 4 Through the detection of a large number of genes which were previously determined to have enriched expression in the dorsal spinal cord and our QRT PCR in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical confirmations this study provides a level of validation for the case of Affymetrix DNA microarrays in conjunction with SAFER algorithm to detect differences in gene regulation Materials and Methods Animals Male Sprague Dawley rats Taconic Germantown NY weighing 200 300 g at the time of testing were maintained in a climate controlled room on a 12 h light dark cycle lights on at 06 00 with food and water available ad libitum All of the handling of the animals and testing was performed in accordance with the policies and recommendations of the International Association for the Study of Pain 15 and received approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of MRL West Point PA Spinal nerve ligation SNL injury was induced using the procedure of Kim and Chung 16 Anesthesia was induced with 2 gaseous isofluorane For induction 3 5 and O 2 500 700 l for maintenance 2 3 and O 2 400 500 l Following dorsal skin incision and muscle separation the posterior interarticular transverse process of L S1 was exposed and carefully removed with a micro Rongeur The L5 and L6 spinal nerves were tightly ligated by a square knot with 6 0 silk thread The muscles were closed with 4 0 absorbable sutures and the skin was closed with wound clips Rats that exhibited motor deficiency such as paw dragging or failure to exhibit subsequent tactile allodynia were excluded from further testing less than 5 of the animals were excluded Sham control rats underwent the same operation and handling as the experimental animals but without spinal nerve ligation Behavioral testing The assessment of tactile allodynia i e decreased threshold to paw withdrawal following probing with non noxious mechanical stimuli consisted of measuring the withdrawal threshold of the paw ipsilateral to the site of nerve injury in response to probing with a series of calibrated von Frey filaments Each filament was applied perpendicularly to the plantar surface of the ligated paw of rats kept in suspended wire mesh cages The withdrawal threshold was determined by sequentially increasing and decreasing the stimulus strength up down method analyzed with a Dixon non parametric test 17 and expressed as the mean withdrawal threshold Animals were tested before surgery and only animals with a paw withdrawal threshold greater than 10 grams were used for the subsequent study Surgically treated animals were then tested on postoperative days 3 and 12 Only those animals that showed allodynia paw withdrawal threshold smaller than 3 g on both days were used for tissue collection on postoperative day 13 less then 10 of the animals were excluded for tissue collection Tissue dissection and RNA preparation Total RNA from each sample was prepared using Trizol Life Technologies Gaithersburg MD followed by RNEasy Qiagen Hilden Germany RNA samples were analyzed by denatured gel electrophoresis In addition total RNA quality was assessed by capillary electrophoresis Bioanalyzer 2100 Agilent Palo Alto CA to ensure that the 28S 18S rRNA ratio was 1 0 for each sample Affymetrix microarray hybridization and staining Hybridization probes were prepared according to Affymetrix instruction 18 5 M primer encoding the T7 RNA polymerase promoter linked to oligo dT 24 primer was used to prime double stranded cDNA synthesis from each total RNA sample 25 g cDNA synthesis reactions were carried out at 42 C using Superscript II RNAseH reverse transcriptase Life Technologies Rockville MD Second strand cDNA synthesis was finished using DNA polymerase I and T4 DNA ligase Each double stranded cDNA sample was purified by sequential phenol chloroform extraction Ambion Austin TX and adsorption to silica Qiaquick kit Qiagen Hilden Germany according to manufacturers instructions Half of each cDNA sample was transcribed in vitro into the copy RNA cRNA labeled

Samples were then hybridized to RG U34A microarrays Affymetrix at 45 C for 16 h Microarrays were washed and sequentially incubated with streptavidin phycoerythrin Molecular Probes Eugene OR biotinylated anti streptavidin antibody Vector Laboratories Inc Burlingame CA and streptavidin phycoerythrin on the Fluidic Station Affymetrix Santa Clara CA Finally the microarrays were scanned with a dedicated Gene Array Scanner Hewlett Packard Instruments TX to capture a fluorescence image Affymetrix microarray data analysis A total of 9 animals was divided into 3 groups and the dorsal and ventral spinal cord were pooled for each group to give rise to 6 samples Each sample was analyzed on one Affymetrix microarray RG U34A For each probeset an array of 16 pairs of oligonucleotides for a specific gene an index of gene expression was calculated and analyzed using the SAFER algorithm 19 for all chip analysis The SAFER gene expression index is a robust and resistant measure of gene expression which is an alternative to the average difference calculated by the Affymetrix analysis software and the model based expression index proposed by Li and Wong 20 Like Li and Wong s procedure the procedure for calculating the SAFER gene index involves both between array normalization and an adjustment for probe specific biases To analyze gene expression in the spinal cord differences in mean level of the gene expression index between dorsal and ventral samples were assessed for each probeset using a paired t test and ANOVA These models facilitated estimation of ratios comparing the dorsal and ventral samples and calculation of p values testing whether the ratios are different from one i e a ratio of one implies no change between the means for the experimental conditions By fitting separate models for each probeset differences were assessed using an error term that included biological variability between samples and did not assume that this variability was the same for all genes Quantitative Real Time PCR QRT PCR Total RNA was treated with DNase I Amplification Grade Invitrogen Carlsbad CA to remove DNA contamination before cDNA synthesis cDNA was synthesized with
