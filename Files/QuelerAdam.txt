 Well I was born in Queens NY And on October twenty fifth 1976 Um my parents are still living up north My father lives in Queens NY off of Throgs Neck Bridge in Bayside and my mother lives in the Poconos which is known as Stroudsburg PA I ve been down here now I would say oh about seven seven years now going on eight years I came down here originally on a to play baseball in the Charlotte area at uh one of the colleges here in Charlotte And uh I guess I m what you would refer to as a Damn Yankee because I haven t left I m staying Well at least for a while I was I m presently going to be going on my way out to Denver CO for a job opportunity But um the reason uh I guess I came down here again was to play baseball My father s a doctor up in Queens NY for 35 years His side of the family is Austrian Jew and my mother s side is uh Roman Catholic Italian from uh from Brooklyn And uh That s an interesting combination That is definitely an interesting combination Um so I don t know um When did your um father s family come to the United States Well he he I believe he is I guess it would be you d refer to third generation Um I think it s his parents parents that came over Um as far as my mother s side I m not too sure It might be roughly around the same She s either she s either third or fourth generation Um Do you know why his parents parents came I think just like everyone else for an opportunity Uh huh Uh an opportunity to come over here I would I would say to practice medicine It seems like everyone in my family is uh a doctor And um the just the same on my mother s side Just for that opportunity to come to America So but um for myself I love NC It s a beautiful area It s a lot different from the North that s for sure Can t say that I ve come to love grits but um I ve met my future wife Is she a good Southern girl She s a real good Southern girl She s a religious background religious background upbringing which I cannot say I ve been a part of And um she s going to calm me down a lot I think and uh instill a lot of instill a lot of positive aspects of my life that have thus far been deferred How did you meet her Well I was fortunate enough to meet her in college in which we were best friends for about two and a half years Until uh finally I don t know the light came on I guess for her I should say because for myself the light came on pretty much as soon as I met her And uh she ll be following me out to Denver CO myself Has she been up North with you She has She um we ve been up recently I proposed to her in Central Park We were in New York City seeing my my family And my uncle was in town who both my father and my uncle were born and raised in the Bronx not too far from Yankee Stadium And uh so I guess you re a big Yankee fan Big time Yankee fan It s been a good couple of years for us Yankee fans here lately And uh we were down on Fifty Third Street which is five blocks away from Central Park and um my fianc e had just passed her boards and it was our anniversary so I decided to surprise her with walking down to Central Park off of Fifty Eighth And um it kind of just worked out perfect I proposed to her I was lucky enough for her to say Yes And um so yeah she s been up north a couple of times and in the PA area as well the Poconos where you hear the honeymooners always go Uh huh And um so Well it sounds like you have a pretty bright future ahead of you Not too bad It s getting brighter and brighter it seems every day And um it s going to be a new adventure for us going out to Denver CO with me being a pharmaceutical sales representative and my fianc e being in the medical profession as well being a nurse And um I ve heard that s a beautiful area Yes it is It s a lot to do A lot of hiking and mountain biking I don t ski I think my fianc e does a little bit But um I don t know how much we ll do of that But I would would suspect that we would end up back up maybe in the Charlotte area If not NC for sure um That would probably make your in laws very happy Very happy along with my family as well Because Denver CO seems to be a little far Um but it s good we get to start our lives together out there and hopefully uh start maybe in a couple years maybe two to three years tops four start working on a family of our own And uh that s something that I very much look forward to Um creating a family of my own Now if you have sons would you want them to play baseball too I would I definitely would And I would probably encourage them to come down in the NC area to play baseball It s been a great experience for me What was what did you like best about playing Well it was always an escape for me Kept me uh motivated Kept me out of trouble which was the big thing and um I like being competitive I know my fianc e is very competitive as well So I know if we do have a little boy even a little girl I know there might be a good chance of being some good athletes in the family So uh yeah I ll definitely want them to pursue baseball but by all means it s probably going to be whatever they want to do I don t want to force them or anything so So where do you see yourself in about 10 years from now In about ten years definitely in the NC area Um the beach is real appealing If not maybe Charlotte probably down by Wilmington or some sort Definitely like to have two children And um have done a lot of things by that point Uh huh Done a lot of traveling with my my wife and seen a lot of things In 10 years from now start setting some sort of ah foundation for the family we re raising in some sort of steady home And no more making big trips out to CO or making a big move for the company or something of that nature So I think uh we should be doing OK in about 10 years
