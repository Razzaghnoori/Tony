 Herb Stein s Unfamiliar Quotations By Herbert Stein 1 184 words posted Thursday May 15 to be composted Thursday May 22 I love to browse through Bartlett s Familiar Quotations It may be lazy of me but I like to taste the plums of many authors whose full puddings I cannot digest For example I cannot make anything of T S Eliot in his entirety But I know that I am in the presence of genius when I read the following lines from The Wasteland O the moon shone bright on Mrs Porter And on her daughter They wash their feet in soda water Of course some of these nuggets are ambiguous Thus we have Swedish Count Axel Oxenstierna writing in the 17 th century Behold my son with how little wisdom the world is governed For a long time I thought that this was a complaint that the world is not governed with more wisdom Recently I have come to think it means that not much wisdom is required to govern the world As recompense small though it be for the pleasure I have got from Bartlett I am setting down a few quotations with explanations where necessary that have resonated with me and are not included in that book If you meet a madman who says that he is a fish and that we are all fishes do you take off your clothes to show him that you do not have fins Milan Kundera Risibles Amours 1984 I love this in part because I am proud that I translated it from the French which in turn was translated from the Czech But I love it even more because it has saved me so much trouble In the past when I encountered some outlandish inanity often about taxes I would sit down at my keyboard and write an answer I am still tempted to do that but since I encountered that quotation I have resisted You may ask How will I know if he is a madman The answer is Don t worry you ll know And if you are in doubt assume he is mad and leave the refutation to others You have plenty to do in the world without having to worry about debating people who may be mad Never waste any time you can spend sleeping Professor Frank H Knight in class at the University of Chicago 1936 Clear enough aside from these questions What qualifies as wasting time and what should you do if you can t sleep I recently encountered a somewhat different quotation from the poet Baudelaire To kill that particular monster time is the most ordinary and legitimate occupation of each person It is interesting that Knight should have used the word waste which is the gangland term for kill Perhaps the reconciliation here is that sleep is the best way of killing time Honesty may not be the best policy but it is worth trying once in a while Richard Nixon in a meeting 1970 This may seem the ultimate in cynicism but the second half of the quotation about trying honesty once in a while seems foreign to many politicians among others Surely there is something unlovely to modern as against medieval minds about marked inequality of either kind income or power Henry C Simons Economic Policy for a Free Society 1948 What fascinates me about this sentence is the word unlovely It is a candid declaration that feelings on this subject are feelings not matters of efficiency or justice but matters of taste of aesthetics of emotions There is a great deal of ruin in a nation Adam Smith in a letter to a friend who after the battle of Saratoga was lamenting that the revolt of the colonies was going to ruin Britain late 18 th century This is a comfort when one is listening to politicians or editorialists describing the ruin that will follow if their pet policies are not adopted If something cannot go on forever it will stop Stein s Law first pronounced in the 1980s This proposition arising first in a discussion of the balance of payments deficit is a response to those who think that if something cannot go on forever steps must be taken to stop it even to stop it at once If a plank creaks in the floor he Ernesto IV snatches up his pistols and imagines that there is a liberal hiding under his bed Stendhal The Charterhouse of Parma 1839 A comment on many of today s pundits Three percent exceeds 2 percent by 50 percent not by 1 percent Edward Denison in conversation about 1960 An obvious point but one that is important and commonly overlooked in discussions of economic growth Observe how he has made a breast of his back In life he wished to see too far before him And now he must crab backwards round this track Dante Alighieri The Inferno Canto XX Circle Eight The Fortune Tellers and Diviners early 14 th century This is Dante s vision of the fate of economic and political forecasters Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge Where is the knowledge we have lost in information T S Eliot The Rock 1934 These Eliot lines not in Bartlett s are an advance comment on the Information Age of which we are now so proud Don t worry you ll do it again Mother in law in conversation many times In the Jewish tradition this sardonic remark is intended to comfort a person who is grieving over having made a serious mistake Thus prediction of whether or not the capitalist order will survive is in part a matter of terminology Joseph Shumpeter Encyclopedia Britannica 1945 Capitalism survived its crisis and went on to great successes But the capitalism that survived and succeeded was not the capitalism of 1929 Herbert Stein The Triumph of the Adaptive Society 1989 This joint entry is a reminder that terms like capitalism socialism liberalism conservatism welfare state and free market have to be defined if they are to be used in intelligent discussion The required definitions are missing most of the time We the American colonists fighting in the War of Independence have shed our blood in the glorious cause in which we are engaged we are ready to shed the last drop in its defense Nothing is above our courage except only with shame I speak it the courage to TAX ourselves James Madison 1782 I was not the first person to observe this fact Anyone can do any amount of work provided it isn t the work he is supposed to be doing Humorist Robert Benchley quoted in The Algonquin Wits 1968 This comes to mind frequently when I am emptying the dishwasher or engaging in a similar activity
