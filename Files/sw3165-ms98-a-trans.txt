            im doing fine   um my names yeah im from uh New York where you from   whats what was your name   uh Brad LeMeaux   oh im Nola and im in Plano Texas   Nola in Texas i i talked to someone from Texas yesterday where in Texas you say   its Plano its just north of Dallas   okay you have pets   uh oh pets yes   do you have pets yeah thats what the topics supposed to be   yeah i didnt quite understand what you said im sorry   i got my New York accent   we dont have uh i grew up in New Jersey but its been a long time since i lived there did you already push the one okay um yeah we have fish thats it   yes thats pretty easy   yeah its uh uh uh neither my husband or i really wanted to take care of cats or dogs or anything like that so and the girls kind of wanted something we have four uh well now we have four girls when we got the fish to start with we had two or three but um   what the   for some reason i just decided to start a fish tank and set up a ten gallon fish tank and it started with the some uh we had a real hard time getting it established tried the goldfish and they were just filthy could not keep the tank clean um eventually i took them back to the store and started started all over again and i had another couple of kinds that ate each other so that bunch didnt work either     what type were they like sicklets and stuff like that   um  there were some neons and a couple of other kind i cant remember what they were   i dont know if the   but but they didnt get along very well whatever they were   i i had fish that were like they were called sicklets a type of family this is when i was a kid they they had um what are they called like oscars and uh i forgot the different names that they had but they would eat eat they would actually they ate when they got big enough they would eat goldfish we would buy goldfish and feed them to them   yeah huh well these were not supposed to be an aggressive kind like that but they were       and uh they i could see them picking on each other   yeah i i agree with that i i i um i dont really wanna deal with any other pets except for stuff like fish i i thought about ive often thought about getting a fish tank but even thats too much work for me   yeah yeah anyway i finally got rid of those those all killed each other off and i cleaned the tank up again and got it all fixed again and so established and i got about half a dozen guppies from a friend and they just bred and bred and bred and theyre uh there mustve been a hundred guppies in that tank and i had i took i mustve taken thirty or forty of them at a time back to the store two or three different times       because there were so many of them i couldnt keep them down but   and what did they do they they just took them back   they took them back and gave me a credit of about a dollar each time   yeah really yeah thats   so yeah helped to buy fish food and filters   yeah thats what my friend used to do with his other fish he used to sell them back to the store  theyd buy them but uh thats cool thats   uhhuh but but but uh then i i i i went for a while where um while i was pregnant with  our new little baby we uh i i just kept forgetting to clean the fish tank and it was really dirty for a long time but those fish still lived in there and um finally i cleaned the tank out and most of them had disappeared  um and i dont think ive got any males in there anymore so theyre not multiplying anymore   thats easier   yeah yeah i need to get a new um algae eater though   do you do you still you still have guppies   yep theres still theres about a dozen guppies in there right now   so you you stayed with the guppies great great yeah the fish are fun   so but thats the only thing weve got  yes you may i know  sorry and and so you have fish or do you have   no i i used to have fish when i was a kid   but you dont have anything right now   but i dont have anything now i i guess when i moved out of my parents house i uh gave my fish to my friends and fish tank i think i gave to someone else um but i thought a few years ago go and get one but ive moved around so much recently   yeah its kind of a problem moving them   yeah theyre not that easy but although it like living in New York City theres definitely no other pet that you would want i mean people some people a lot of people have cats some people have dogs i mean ive ive even seen big big dogs in small apartments and i dont really see that   you feel sorry for them   yeah someday if i move out into the country i like it like a you know like a Labrador or something like that some you know bigger dog that could kind of run around outside and stuff   yeah   but yeah you see these big dog i mean i see this guy in my building with some i think its like a golden retriever or something like that and he hes good though he takes him out all the time or her out all the time   uhhuh youd have to do it an awful lot though   yeah this guy he seems like he runs and stuff and runs with the dog so he probably gets in enough exercise   yeah   but you know lot
