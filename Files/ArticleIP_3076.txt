 What s in a Face A sphinx has the body of a lion and the face of a man Why is this no good Simple Because in order to have a face you need a pair of hands Paws won t do Animals with paws must have big furry jutting muzzles which rule out a face They need muzzles for biting to defend themselves and to attack prey whereas possessors of hands can fashion and chuck a spear or throw a punch Animals need muzzles to carry things and to gnaw on their food whereas possessors of hands can make a fire to tenderize their viands And in order to have growing scalp hair as humans uniquely do you need to have hands to cut it lest it get so long that it jeopardizes your survival So faces presuppose hands Sphinxes and centaurs and other countenanced but handless creatures not only do not exist they could not exist That exciting aper u occurred to me in the course of reading The Face and The Hand two books that otherwise brought me unremitting boredom Well almost unremitting The Face made me cringe a lot Its author Daniel McNeill won a science writing prize a few years ago and this seems to have gone to his head His prose oozes a kind of rotten poetry and no observation is too banal to be left unspoken Take McNeill s extended meditation on kissing please A kiss can pour love from lips to lips two receptacles filling each other The lovers tongues caress each other dance about the teeth and inner cheeks bathe in each other s oral fluids Long luxurious smooches can end in a sound like planes of glass rubbing or even in a cheep Family members and relatives commonly kiss The kiss is often a gesture of greeting I didn t know all that did you As for The Hand by California neurologist Frank R Wilson even the epigraphs are tedious One of them reads The true relevance of lateralization of function will be ascertained only by careful research that acknowledges that aspects of this function develop throughout the life span beginning at birth if not before Try as I might I can detect no lambent flicker of humor in these pages There are some scattered interesting bits in both The Face and The Hand however Someone ought to extract and put them in a concise form to save people the trouble of reading the books In fact that s what I ll do Let s begin with the chin It is a singularly human facial feature one that even the Neanderthals lacked The chin seems to have emerged around 130 000 years ago Why Scientists have no idea What they do know however is that men s chins have been getting larger over the last 200 generations They have a theory for this The male chin grows during puberty in response to testosterone Testosterone weakens the immune system So paradoxically a big chin on a healthy man is an advertisement of robustness It means that despite an excess of testosterone his immune system is still powerful enough to fight off disease Therefore women should fancy a big chin on a mate and the trait is sexually selected Insert Jay Leno joke here I do not know whether this theory is true I do know that in good society chins are very important Style largely depends on the way the chin is worn They are worn very high at present If the face has been getting longer at the bottom over the generations it has been getting shorter and broader on top McNeill does not mention this but it is true The trend is called brachycephalization and it has been happening mainly in rural Poland between the Carpathian Mountains and the Black Sea which for some arcane reason is one of the few places on Earth where humans are still evolving Anthropologists discovered this by examining skeletons from the region going back to 1300 some 30 generations The Darwinian advantage of having a shorter head if any remains unknown Some Indian tribes have gone for the same effect by a horrific sort of plastic surgery The Choctaws flattened the heads of babies by placing bags of sand on their brows and ridiculed whites as longheads By contrast Nefertiti the wife of Akhenaton seems to have had her cranium artificially stretched for beauty s sake Did this really make her beautiful What renders a face truly soul bewitching Whatever it is it transcends culture despite what Naomi Wolf may try to tell you People everywhere share the same criteria of facial beauty This conclusion is supported by a wealth of studies over the last 15 years in which individuals from different cultures have been asked to rate photos for beauty Chinese English and Indian women prefer the same Greek men Hispanic and black Americans agree on which newly arrived Asian women are the genuine babes and so on The key ingredient seems to be averageness The most ordinary features are aesthetically the most extraordinary If you use a computer to merge a lot of faces together the result tends to look as fetching as Leonardo DiCaprio This effect was first noticed when a 19 th century eugenicist tried to create an average criminal face by making a photographic composite of lots of mug shots The prototypical criminal turned out to be way too handsome There are two evolutionary advantages to looking average One is that potential mates can be sure you re a human and hence biologically worth mating with Remember Homo sapiens lived side by side with Neanderthals for many thousands of years and we differed from them chiefly in the face Second average facial features are a sign of good genes of being close to the optimal design favored by natural selection But some faces are even more pleasing than the average face Women are judged to be beautiful when they have larger than average pupils and retrouss noses such babyish features suggest that most of their childbearing years are still ahead Full lips are a plus probably because they reflect high estrogen levels and thus high fertility Contrariwise masculinized features in women like a large angular jaw signal too much testosterone which reduces fertility Our faces are fur less and exposed to the world so that they can be read Cheaters and liars imperil the cooperative enterprises necessary for survival but they give themselves away by their skewed facial expressions The most important facial muscles are not under the control of the will A fake smile is seldom persuasive it lasts too long it looks wrong around the eyes Even at the corners of the mouth the phony smile betrays itself by being subtly lopsided Involuntary expressions arising in the lower unitary brain affect both sides of the mouth equally but willed expressions are governed by the cerebral hemispheres the dominant of which sends a stronger signal There is much maundering in The Face about the face of the Mona Lisa the face of Jesus the face of God I have not seen the face of God but I have seen a certain Washington literary editor who looks like the Wrath of God T he Hand tells the affecting story of how the thumb rose from being just another digit to being opposable For our simian ancestors in the trees falling from branch to branch was a normal mode of locomotion but you had better have a prehensile paw for grabbing the crucial limb at the last moment When we landed on the ground hands were first employed in knuckle walking later in juggling and brain surgery The most interesting thing about the human hand is the phenomenon of hand dominance which like speech and toolmaking is unknown among apes Why are we either righties or lefties and why in the ratio of 9 to 1 Is it this asymmetry in the use of our hands one of which is good the other relatively disabled that points up their intimate alliance with the brain whose two hemispheres each controlling a different hand are similarly specialized It may well be that the hands molded the brain not vice versa the stimulus being the all important activity of marksmanship throwing missiles at prey One amusing but untestable hypothesis has it that females were the principal hunters on the African savanna and that they invariably threw with their right arms because they were carrying their babies in their left arms up against their hearts the beating of which soothed and quieted the infant In any case the secret of manual dexterity is all in the timing hitting the piano key or releasing the curveball at precisely the right instant And it is in the analytical left hemisphere of the brain which controls the right side of the body where these sorts of timing decisions are best computed It is a trite thought I know but our hands and our faces come very close to being our selves our higher selves at least our lower ones reposing in some oafish organs in the gut and below The self that observes the world as a Cartesian spectator lurks directly behind the face just above the eyes The self that engages the world as a Heideggerian homo Faber inhabits the hands just above the palms Both are subject to alienating experiences Staring at our face in the mirror as The Face author points out we become first and third person at once viewer and viewed Even when the face is utterly impassive we can know what it s thinking I know what it s thinking and enjoy a moment of mind reading For some reason this works best at the end of a cocktail party when you have ducked into the bathroom and are feeling slightly squiffy Or wiggling your fingers by letting the motive force propagate directly from your will to the digits you suddenly notice the real cause of the action is quite elsewhere in tendons rippling beneath the skin way up at the elbow a bit of mechanical trumpery that gives the lie to the self I would recommend these metaphysical exercises as a cheap alternative to reading The Face and The Hand
