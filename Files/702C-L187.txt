 Very Rev Father J Gabriel Karambis Director December 1999 Dear friend in Christ A gift wrapped box under a Christmas tree Ordinarily this is such a happy sight an image of the anticipation that we feel inside as the holiday season approaches once again But in certain homes this Christmas the sight of unopened gifts under the tree will bring tears of grief and sorrow For these boxes will remain in their wrappings long after all of the other presents are opened Christmas will come and go and these gifts will sit untouched The boxes will be marked with the names of Cassie Corey Rachel Isaiah Kelly Kyle and the other students of Columbine High School who lost their lives earlier this year All around our country Christmas presents bearing the names of school children will stay in their ribbons and wrappings under the tree because of the escalating epidemic of violence against children in recent years It s my guess that you are asking yourself What is happening to our children What is wrong with our world In our public schools teenagers are forbidden to discuss religious topics on school grounds even in after school clubs and societies Young people are exposed daily to violence pornography and other unwholesome influences over the internet It s my guess that you are also asking yourself What can I do to help My intuition of course has a very specific basis you are a person who cares as demonstrated by your annual stewardship donation to your parish I know that you make it a point to be involved in your community and to support a variety of worthy causes Consequently I know that you go to extra lengths to be compassionate and caring to others And that suggests to me that you may well be interested in joining a program that tries to help our children in the face of the problems I mentioned above On the chance that my guess is right I am writing to you today to invite you to become a member of LOGOS the League Of Greek Orthodox Stewards LOGOS is comprised of women and men who wish to contribute to the ministries especially the youth programs of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America LOGOS members contribute to the ministries for the Church over and above their other contributions to their local parishes There is so much that needs to be done in our ministries that at times it may seem overwhelming But another way to look at it is to consider that there is so much that we can accomplish together Through your tax deductible donation to LOGOS you will open a universe of opportunities to the Orthodox youth of our nation You can provide the safe and loving environment of an Orthodox after school program for children who might otherwise have nowhere else to go You can educate parents and youth workers on the best ways to counsel teenagers about the frightening issues facing them like drug use and premarital sex You can aid children at Ionian Village summer camp in Greece where they can strengthen their Orthodox Christian faith while enjoying the beauty of Hellenic culture You can establish and support Orthodox Campus Fellowships at colleges and universities across the country so that young people who are away from home for the first time can have the support of others who share their beliefs and values You can train Sunday Church School teachers to provide the highest level of instruction in religious education You can provide for a child who attends St Basil Academy a ministry of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese where needy children are given the love and security of a home away from home You can give all these children a truly wonderful Christmas gift the gift of your love and attention and concern so that they may enjoy this Christmas season and many more in health and safety You can do all this with the simplest gesture Your membership donation to LOGOS will help fund all these programs and more Every penny counts in the fight to save our children Simply check off your tax deductible contribution on the enclosed membership invitation Please mail it back today in the envelope provided for your convenience so that we can continue to carry on this vital ministry With love in Christ P S There are many children who have been helped by the youth programs of our Holy Archdiocese But there are many more who still need our help Thank you for your time and considering my appeal
