 Background DNA topoisomerase I TOP1 is a ubiquitously expressed protein that relaxes DNA supercoils generated during many transactions of DNA including replication transcription repair and chromatin condensation and remodeling TOP1 has been shown to interact with many proteins including components of the holo TFIIIC complex 1 TFIID 2 p53 3 SV 40 large T antigen 4 nucleolin 5 the RING finger protein topors 6 the RNA splicing factors PSF p54 nrb 7 and SF2 ASF 8 the cell cycle regulatory protein ARF 9 RNA pol II complex 10 11 and HTLV type 1 tax oncoprotein 12 TOP1 also interacts with a variety of unidentified proteins involved in its phosphorylation ubiquitination and sumoylation 13 14 15 16 17 We used the core domain of TOP1 lacking the N terminal highly charged region the coiled coil linker domain and the C terminal active site domain as bait in two hybrid screens for TOP1 interacting proteins We obtained multiple independent cDNA clones coding for BTBD1 and BTBD2 two uncharacterized BTB domain containing kelch like proteins The interactions of HeLa cell TOP1 with the BTBD proteins was confirmed using GST pulldown and was further suggested by their intracellular co localization Results Identification of TOP1 interacting proteins using two hybrid assays The core domain of human TOP1 from residue 198 to 651 was used as the bait in two hybrid screens 18 19 20 This region of TOP1 lacks the N terminal 25 of the protein that is highly charged and the C terminal domain containing the active site and the coiled coil linker The resulting polypeptide comprises 60 of the TOP1 sequence A screen of a HeLa cell library yielded 56 colonies that tested positive in the two hybrid assays growth on plates lacking histidine or uracil lack of growth on plates containing 5 fluoroorotic acid and induction of lacZ resulting in blue color when assayed with X gal Nucleotide sequence analysis of 34 of these clones revealed two cDNA contigs of 15 and 19 that predict proteins whose sequences are 80 identical The proteins were named BTBD1 and BTBD2 according to a recent analysis of their genomic sequences 21 The clones of each contig differed in the amount of 5 sequence present 11 15 and 15 19 of BTBD1 and BTBD2 respectively had different 5 ends In the two hybrid growth assays and galactosidase assays each of the clones tested as positive as the control for strongly interacting proteins the interaction of c Fos with c Jun ProQuest Life Technologies Another two hybrid screen using a different two hybrid system Matchmaker Clontech also yielded 2 clones identical to the contig of 15 clones BTBD1 Characterization of BTBD1 and BTBD2 mRNA The longest BTBD1 cDNA clone obtained from two hybrid screening 3196 bp contains an ORF that encodes a 482 aa protein starting with an ATG that is preceded by an in frame stop codon Sequences in GenBank confirmed our sequence One was obtained by the oligo capping method FLJ20724 and another assembled from partial cDNA and RACE fragments 21 The longest BTBD2 cDNA obtained from two hybrid screening 2413 bp contained an ORF starting at the 5 end To obtain the missing 5 cDNA a nested PCR strategy was used to amplify the sequence from four independent cDNA libraries but no extended sequences were obtained 5 RACE Life Technologies also failed to produce longer clones This difficulty to obtain longer cDNA clones was seen by others 21 The GC richness at the 5 end 85 nucleotides are 79 GC may form secondary structures that block reverse transcriptase Analysis of the BTBD2 gene immediately upstream of the 5 end of our cDNA predicts an ORF that begins with an ATG and encodes 85 amino acids in frame with the ORF of our longest BTBD2 clone however the 255 nucleotides encoding these in frame amino acids sequence are 89 GC rich To determine if this sequence might be part of the BTBD2 mRNA RT PCR followed by nested PCR was used Two antisense primers complementary to exon 2 were used to prime reverse transcription Sense primers for PCR amplification were located within predicted exon 1 Fig 1A Amplified products of 460 and 306 bp that are predicted from the mRNA template resulted Fig 1B If genomic DNA had been the template products greater than 18 kb would have been obtained Furthermore sequencing of the 460 bp amplification product confirmed it to be the predicted mRNA Fig 1A The cDNA starting at the predicted start codon was deposited in GenBank AF355797 Northern blotting and in silico expression analysis Northern blotting was used to determine the tissue distribution and sizes of the mRNA encoding BTBD1 and BTBD2 Fig 2 Poly A RNA from human tissues 2 g lane was probed with BTBD1 BTBD2 or TOP1 cDNA Each mRNA was detected in all the tissues tested BTBD1 mRNA was highly expressed in testes heart and skeletal muscle BTBD2 was more highly expressed in skeletal muscle Only a single message size was detected for each BTBD1 3 2 kb and BTBD2 2 8 kb BTBD1 and BTBD2 cDNA were found in libraries from the following tissues amniotic aorta bone brain bone marrow colon ear embryo foreskin gall bladder germ heart kidney lung muscle ovary pancreas parathyroid placenta skin spleen stomach testis thymus tonsil and uterus LocusID 53339 and 55643 respectively 22 BTBD1 and BTBD2 was also expressed in a large number of tumor types and normal tissues present in SAGE serial analysis of gene expression libraries SAGEmap 23 Mapping of the regions of TOP1 and the BTBDs that interact BTBD1 and BTBD2 were mapped by deletion analysis to identify amino acid sequences required for interaction with TOP1 In two hybrid assays N terminal deletions of 36 of BTBD1 177 aa or 43 BTBD2 228 aa did not eliminate binding to TOP1 Fig 3A B In contrast C terminal deletions of 112 and 33 aa of BTBD1 and BTBD2 respectively eliminated binding to TOP1 in the two hybrid assays Thus sequences very close to the C terminus are required for the interaction with TOP1 by this analysis Two hybrid analysis was also used to map regions of the TOP1 core domain that interact with BTBD2 The region upstream of aa 215 and downstream of aa 329 were not required for binding BTBD2 Fig 3C The fragment of TOP1 from amino acid 215 to 331 was capable of binding to BTBD2 This region includes 18 aa of core subdomain I all of core subdomain II and 10 amino acids of the second section of core subdomain I GST pulldown assays confirm two hybrid deletion mapping Truncated fragments of BTBD1 and BTBD2 were tested in GST pull down assays for their ability to bind TOP1 in nuclear extracts of HeLa cells The GST pulldown assay confirmed the positive interactions seen in the two hybrid deletion mapping Fig 4 In addition we found that two N terminal truncated BTBD1 and BTBD2 were able to co precipitate TOP1 from nuclear extracts BTBD1 213 482 303 482 BTBD2 249 525 289 525 although they were negative in the two hybrid assay Since truncated fragments may be unstable in yeast and may not accumulate to levels sufficient to produce a positive result we used roughly equal amounts of each truncated protein to test for binding to TOP1 in nuclear extracts Taken together the results of the two hybrid and GST pulldown assays narrow the interacting region of BTBD1 and BTBD2 to roughly the C terminal half of each protein with critical residues within the last 50 residues Effect of GST BTBD2 on TOP1 activity To test the effect of BTBD2 on the supercoil relaxation activity of TOP1 HeLa cell nuclear extracts containing TOP1 were incubated with GST or GST BTBD2 aa 86 525 GST BTBD2 slightly inhibited the supercoil relaxation activity of TOP1 increasing the time required to completely relax the supercoiled DNA by about two fold as compared with GST alone Fig 5A The DNA cleavage assay was also used to determine if BTBD2 affected TOP1 activity This assay measures the ability of TOP1 to cleave end labeled DNA substrates in the presence of the anticancer drug camptothecin which blocks the ligation step of the cleavage religation reaction of TOP1 A 36 bp DNA containing a single strong TOP1 cleavage site 24 or a 161 bp restriction fragment 25 was used as the substrate GST BTBD2 addition produced a slight inhibition of TOP1 cleavage activity relative to GST alone Fig 5B on the smaller substrate and had no detectable effect on cleavage activity or cleavage site selection by TOP1 on the larger substrate 5C Cellular localization of BTBD2 and co localization with TOP1 To determine the localization of BTBD2 in cells we transiently transfected HeLa cells with expression plasmids encoding either myc tagged full length BTBD2 m BTBD2F or a truncated BTBD2 having the N terminal half of the BTB domain removed m BTBD2T The full length BTBD2 localized entirely to cytoplasmic bodies Fig 6B m BTBD2F The truncated BTBD2 localized predominantly to nuclear bodies with a minor fraction localizing to cytoplasmic bodies Fig 6C m BTBD2T The localization of full length BTBD2 to cytoplasmic bodies was surprising because the cytoplasm is separated from the nucleus where endogenous TOP1 resides and transfected GFP TOP1 localizes 26 27 28 29 30 Because TOP1 and BTBD2 are not predominantly found in the same compartments they may interact transiently or they may interact only under specific conditions when they may be in the same compartment We therefore analyzed mitotic cells but did not observe co localization of TOP1 and the BTBDs not shown We then tested for co localization in transfected cells Though the truncated m BTBD2T localized to distinct nuclear bodies its co localization with endogenous TOP1 could not be determined against the background of endogenous TOP1 diffuse nuclear staining However in cells co transfected with GFP TOP1 and m BTBD2T the m BTBD2T staining was nuclear diffuse as well as in nuclear bodies indicating that m BTBD2T interacts with GFP TOP1 which localizes throughout the nucleus not shown To determine if TOP1 co localizes with BTBD2 in the cytoplasm GFP TOP1 lacking an NLS 30 was co transfected with full length BTBD2 m BTBD2F or truncated BTBD2 m BTBD2T GFP TOP1 lacking a NLS GFP pTI 6 localizes diffusely within the cytoplasm Fig 6Aand 30 In cells transfected with both GFP pTI 6 and full length m BTBD2F the diffuse cytoplasmic GFP pTI 6 significantly decreased and GFP pTI 6 co localized with m BTBD2F to cytoplasmic bodies Fig 6D In cells transfected with GFP pTI 6 and truncated m BTBD2T truncated m BTBD2T was not in nuclear bodies as when transfected alone rather it co localized with GFP pTI 6 to cytoplasmic bodies Fig 6E Thus when co transfected with GFP TOP1 lacking a NLS both full length and the N terminal deleted BTBD2 co localized with TOP1 to cytoplasmic bodies Discussion Two hybrid screens have identified BTBD1 and BTBD2 as proteins that interact with the core domain of TOP1 BTBD1 and BTBD2 were isolated as 15 and 19 independent clones respectively and in two hybrid assays they interacted as strongly as the control for strongly interacting proteins c Fos with c Jun BTBD1 and BTBD2 also bound HeLa cell TOP1 100 kDa in nuclear extracts by GST pulldown assays N terminal truncation studies showed the C terminal 37 to 45 of the BTBD proteins are sufficient for binding TOP1 C terminal deletions of either protein eliminated binding to TOP1 C terminal truncation of 112 aa of BTBD1 or 33 aa of BTBD2 in the two hybrid assay or a C terminal truncation of 40 aa of BTBD2 in GST pulldown Truncation of the BTB domains demonstrated that they were not required for interaction with TOP1 The region of TOP1 sufficient for binding BTBD2 was narrowed to residues 215 329 in the cap region core subdomain II 31 Catalytic activities of TOP1 were affected slightly or not at all by co incubation with GST BTBD2 suggesting that the interaction does not regulate enzyme activity directly We cloned the full length BTBD1 cDNA from a HeLa cell library This sequence is 3196 bp and the start codon is preceded by a stop codon 6 nucleotides upstream GenBank FLJ20724 Our sequence is comparable to two others in GenBank one of which was obtained by the oligo capping method suggesting that it begins at the 5 cap 21 32 Our repeated attempts to clone the 5 end of the BTBD2 by library screening and the RACE method were unsuccessful We tested sequences directly upstream of the longest cDNA in the BTBD2 gene for their presence on the mRNA RT PCR and sequencing of the RT PCR product demonstrated that this 255 nucleotide 89 GC rich sequence is present on the BTBD2 mRNA and that it shares predicted polypeptide sequence with BTBD homologues and orthologs The BTBD proteins contain an amino terminal BTB POZ domain as well as a C terminal region that is related to proteins that contain the kelch domain Neither of these regions yields unequivocal information for functional classification The BTB domain is a highly conserved 120 amino acid hydrophobic rich protein protein interaction domain that mediates homodimerization and heterodimerization of a large number of proteins with diverse functions 9 The three dimensional structure of one BTB domain 33 has been characterized through structure function studies 34 Proteins containing BTB domains are currently categorized into three groups 35 1 DNA binding proteins often containing zinc fingers in the C terminal region 2 actin binding proteins that contain a kelch repeat of 50 residues that terminate in a pair of glycine residues 36 and 3 proteins that have neither an actin binding domain nor a DNA binding domain The BTBD proteins belong to the last category although they are distantly related to kelch proteins 25 identical over 250 aa they lack the residues that are characteristic of kelch repeats a double glycine sequence and a tyrosine separated from a tryptophan by precisely 6 residues 35 37 BTBD1 and BTBD2 are closely related sharing 80 identical amino acid sequence They are one of eleven genes in 19p13 3 p12 with close homology to genes in 15q24 q26 that have apparently resulted from duplications of a common ancestral gene 38 Both BTBD1 and BTBD2 are widely if not ubiquitously expressed in human tissues The predicted promoter regions are highly GC rich and lack canonical TATA boxes suggesting that they may be housekeeping genes 39 40 Close mammalian relatives of BTBD1 and BTBD2 include the mouse orthologs that are 98 and 95 identical respectively as well as highly similar rat and bovine partial sequences 21 Sequence relatives in lower organisms include a C elegans sequence with 58 identities with BTBD2 429 residues 2 gaps F38H4 7 and a D melanogaster sequence with 46 identities 437 residues 3 gaps CG5319 The human genome encodes two proteins with 46 436 residues 3 gaps CAC22147 and 45 497 residues 5 gaps AF353674 identities compared with BTBD2 These proteins comprise a small family whose members have not been functionally characterized and are evidently specific to animals because putative orthologs are not present in available fungi and plant sequence databases We have demonstrated an interaction between BTBD2 and TOP1 by two hybrid GST pull down and intracellular co localization analyses Studies are underway to functionally characterize BTBD1 and BTBD2 and understand their interaction with TOP1 Conclusions Fifteen and nineteen independent cDNA clones of BTBD1 and BTBD2 respectively were isolated from two hybrid screens and found to interact as strongly as c Fos interacted with c Jun in the two hybrid assays The interactions of TOP 1 with BTBD1 and BTBD2 were confirmed by deletion mapping using two hybrid and GST pulldown assays Less than the C terminal half of each BTBD protein lacking the BTB domain is sufficient for binding to TOP1 TOP1 from aa 215 to 329 interacted with BTBD2 GFP BTBD2 localized to cytoplasmic bodies BTBD2 had little effect on the supercoil relaxation or DNA cleavage activity of TOP1 in vitro Co transfected BTBD2 and TOP1 co localized The BTBD2 message contains 255 nucleotides that are 89 GC rich and are predicted to encode the N terminus of a 525 amino acid protein BTBD1 and BTBD2 mRNA were detected in all human tissues tested BTBD1 mRNA was highly expressed in testes heart and skeletal muscle BTBD2 was more highly expressed in skeletal muscle Only a single mRNA species was present for each BTBD1 and BTBD2 Putative orthologs of BTBD1 and BTBD2 are found in C elegans 58 identities 429 residues 2 gaps F38H4 7 and D melanogaster 46 identities 437 residues 3 gaps CG5319 Two paralogs of BTBD1 and BTBD2 are present in the human genome CAC22147 and AF353674 Materials and Methods Plasmid construction To construct the bait expression plasmid pGBD cTOP1 the core domain of TOP1 cTOP1 amino acids 198 651 was amplified by
