 yeah well um i think the weather lately has been um a bit warmer than i would expect this time of year there we go i think that s true the uh the Bermuda grass is greening up uh in in March it sometimes doesn t really start doing that until the first part of April so yeah so i think we re a little ahead uh ahead of schedule on that yeah i was out in my yard yesterday afternoon and i noticed all that grass coming up and i thought ooh we ve got to start this mowing bit soon that s true it s been a a fun break but it the break is over yeah well um oh i guess another thing i ve noticed too here lately is that even though we ve had some pretty warm days it s been awfully gray you know just yeah now the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny yeah but it seems like every time at work i look out my window it s gray well yeah but i d rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend so oh i go for that yeah yeah in fact i m a little worried about this one coming up here we have a long weekend and it sounds like it s gonna be a little bit on the cool side yeah i hadn t heard whether it s gonna rain or not i think there s an eighty percent chance this evening but it s supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow and then the rest ll be without rain well that s good but i think the highs are gonna be in the sixties and the lows in the forties that s getting back to a little bit chillier yeah that s probably a a little bit under what it is for this time of year i i think i haven t seen the weather the news the weather on the news in the evening lately but i think the average high would be it should be about seventy yeah i m not certain either but you re probably right yeah well i like it when it s sort of a a medium temperature uh maybe seventy five to eighty somewhere in there i i don t like it when it s too cool or too warm i m much more apt to get things done when it s at that sort of in between temperature yeah that s true um one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninety nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high hm and what that tells me is that the summer weather is very predictable that it doesn t vary very much yeah you re probably right yeah i mean any other time of year that s not the case because it could be very warm or very cold yes as a matter of fact i heard the weather the other day on TV and i think it was one day this week a year ago uh huh they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather you know it wasn t just a super bad storm but it was it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the the late spring time right right yeah one of the weirdest things i saw i think it was around this time last year was a twenty six degree lightning storm oh wow i you know i was going into the grocery store and a a lightning bolt was almost directly overhead and it was twenty six degrees out hm and i thought well gee i ve i ve never known it to lightning at that temperature yeah that that is pretty unusual and you really take notice of it too uh that s right it uh it probably was a lot warmer up high sometimes they get those inversions like when we had that twelve and a half days a few years ago that it never got up as high as freezing the air temperature at five thousand feet was fifty degrees hm because the cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and couldn t get away wow yeah i don t don t like that super cold stuff nope i just don t move very well when it s that cold yep i i m really enjoying this now well this has been interesting yeah well not not too challenging to the brain not not a real in depth topic but enjoyed talking to you nope all right Ellen well you have a good day okay okay good bye bye bye
