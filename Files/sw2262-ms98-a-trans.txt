 well i um i haven t really lived in a lot of big cities i mean i m living in Dallas now Plano is outside of Dallas but um so i don t really have a lot of experience with air pollution huh uh but i know when i lived down in Houston on the outskirts of Houston there were some towns like Pasadena that had oil refineries huh uh and um if you would drive by there like on your way to the beach or something huh uh there would just be dumping this huge amounts of smoke into the air and it always smelled really bad we know that that was huh uh really really really bad for the atmosphere what have you got up there well i i live out in the country so that part is good uh we re maybe one hundred miles from Pittsburgh which has a lot of pollution from their plants uh huh and right now in our area were fighting against a toxic waste incinerator oh no and uh it won t be too far from where we live and everybody really has been you know fighting against it because we just we do not want it well we don t want one any place sure we would like the uh industry to do more to take care of the uh waste products before they turn to incineration because we feel that uh the small percentage that they re going to be putting into the air is too much you know the uh yeah and it s just i mean it s just so bad that there is just so much going into the air and and the little bit you say that there putting in here and there and everywhere it all adds up huh uh huh uh and plus all the problems in uh the Middle East with all that smoke and oh that has to be terrible over there yeah so it s just um why are we doing this to ourselves i just don t know but um i you know what really amazes me about like that Pasadena area and the oil refineries huh uh huh uh is that there would be houses and people living just really close to it i mean between the freeway and the oil refinery you would see a neighborhood and yeah huh uh you just thought well it s obvious that there s a lot going up in the air there and what comes up must come down yeah yeah breathing it we re breathing it all the time and we yes and and how if they have all of those um toxicity i mean it there s signs around saying how dangerous it is and then here you are living close to next to it just doesn t make too much sense um hum um hum no and i figure we re paying to take care of this toxic waste no matter who does it So huh uh and they have shown some of the industries have been real good at uh uh doing their part in uh reducing the amount that they have huh uh uh they ve reused some of it uh it can be recycled a lot of their things huh uh and that they ve shown that it uh to begin with apparently it does cost more um hum but once they get started it s really it saves them money in the end and it cuts down on the end product that has to be dealt with some other way um hum and if they would all that s what that s what we want done is we want industry to take you know more responsibility in taking care of it well um individual companies and things are so selfish and their desires to save a few dollars and and that they don t care about the environmental impact that they make huh uh huh uh they re greedy it s money is what is it s it s the money uh huh yes they re making fantastic amounts on these things and uh even the incinerator the money and the income that they re going to make off this is you know just astronomical um hum well have you ever visited um like Los Angeles or any place that s ever it s kind of known that it has uh pollution in it s air we ve never been we went as far as as uh like Las Vegas and Yellow Stone Park we did go we should have gone the whole way over but we didn t um hum uh huh but i understand that we have an aunt that lives out there and when she was visiting here she would look up at the stars and she said how wonderful it was to be able to look into the sky and see some of the things that she saw well it s uh huh um hum she said they couldn t see those things out there um hum because of the smog and everything that s so awful well what about in New York i guess you ve gone that way maybe no never been in New York i don t want to go there yeah pretty funny have you been there well i ve been to New York i have um relatives that direction i have it s um where are you close is it close to Phoenixville Pennsylvania oh um no i never heard of that one because i have family there and we re near Pittsburgh Clarion University oh huh uh it s pretty neat it s it s kind of northwest part of Pennsylvania that s beautiful country up that way i know it s um very lush and pretty up in the back in the east it s really huh uh you sound very young are you a young person well i m thirty one thirty one you re young seems kind of old to me no you re young you have a lot of life yet and these we have some people who say well this isn t going to affect me this air pollution huh uh uh older people or they think they re far enough away from something um hum that it s and they don t realize these things are going to affect everybody and if you re older it s not going to affect you that way you have grandchildren you have children uh nieces nephews whatever friends yes uh everybody is going to be affected by it that s really true and we all you know need to be willing to help pay a little bit like i ve heard some people uh grumble about their uh cars passing their emission tests and things and huh uh how they ve had to how it s more expensive and things and i thought well it s so much better huh uh they say it has really made a difference though uh huh now see we don t have that here yet oh you don t no we don t have that testing in that down here yet hum but they i have read that that that it has really helped where the problem is greater where the population is greater uh huh and that it has made a difference well i really think it must i think every i mean well think about how many automobiles there are um hum um hum and each is putting out like we have a car an older one of our cars is an older car and every time you start it from the tail pipe it makes a black spot on the cement um hum um hum um hum and you know that that is a sign something s coming out yeah yeah and that s all cars are doing that and it s really polluting the air yeah yeah if you have to put a price on it which is more valuable life or paying a little more huh uh and it s also it s causing of lot of the real terrible suffering like cancer and things um hum we sure wouldn t want um hum so much more people suffering from that yeah and like i said i think you have to pay for it no matter what you do you with it because it s industry we re paying industry to make the products and we re helping pay for there making these end products that are toxic waste then we have to pay for them to pay somebody to carry it away someplace huh uh huh uh then they put it in the dump some place and they find out well this dump doesn t work so we have to clean this up and move it someplace else We end up paying for it again now we re going to end up paying for it again by having it burned in these large incinerators and we re paying to have our air polluted and our water streams polluted huh uh pretty sad or the where they want to put the one area they want to put the incinerator is right in the middle of the Clarion the two water sheds that feed Clarion river oh no and you know it just boggles our mind that they can consider even putting it there because huh uh if that water gets contaminated it will go on down to Pittsburgh it will you know it affects so many people um hum and it s just hard to think that they could allow them to do things like this no no it s scary it s scary huh uh it really is it s really awful well i ve really enjoyed the conversation it s helped me to think more about some issues that i need to be thinking more about it is really a concern huh uh its a and it s instead of waiting until it directly affects me like you say it s important to be involved ahead of time well you have a good day huh uh um hum well you too thank you huh uh bye bye bye
