 Free Willy The Financial Times of London which never tires of publishing judicious editorials about Flytrap drew its conclusions about the impeachment trial Wednesday While the trial was technically legal it had failed the crucial test set by the founding fathers that such a process must inspire public confidence This is because the vehemence with which Kenneth Starr pursued the president is now seen by many as an unacceptable constraint on executive power The obvious lesson was that the independent counsel law should be redesigned when it comes up for review by Congress at the end of June so that the choice of counsel be made in a way both independent of party politics and yet seen to be democratic The FT said Selection by a panel appointed by the judiciary would be an option Another lesson of the impeachment was that the limit to partisanship implied by the U S Constitution was breached in this case when the House of Representatives sent Mr Clinton to trial in the Senate at the same time as some of its members suggested that censure rather than impeachment was the aim It is incumbent on the House to recognise that an impeachment trial should be a way of protecting the office of president not punishing the man The paper added Mr Clinton has certainly been shamed by the process But the ultimate victims could be the pursuers not the pursued That surely was not the founding fathers aim An op ed article in the Times of London by its Washington correspondent Bronwen Maddox said Wednesday that the waste and misery generated by Flytrap left a sour taste but it may have prompted a neat political reversal helping to put Democrats back in control of the House of Representatives and a Republican in the White House In the Daily Telegraph Ambrose Evans Pritchard the most determined anti Clinton journalist in Britain said in an op ed that it was time to admit defeat He blamed the Republicans for letting the president off the hook by the b tise of indicting him on Monica Lewinsky charges instead of on the politicisation of the Justice Department and the FBI that forms the core scandal pervading the abuses of this administration He concluded So the man caught red handed in perjury obstruction of justice and ungallantly smearing his lover as a demented stalker is hailed as the winner The world knows that he is guilty but he is the one enjoying a victory cigar What a way to end the 20 th century The stories dominating the European press Wednesday were in France the opening of the manslaughter trial of three prominent French politicians for the state s distribution of HIV tainted blood in Germany the Christian Democrat Party s sweep to power in the state of Hesse using an anti immigrant election strategy in Italy the government s decision to regularize some 250 000 illegal immigrants from outside the European Union and in Britain no particular story though the Daily Telegraph led its front page with the opening of the country s first ever war crimes trial that of Anthony Sawoniuk a 77 year old former Belorussian accused of leading search and kill squads to hunt down Jews who had escaped a massacre during the Nazi wartime occupation of Belarus In France the Paris daily Lib ration broke ranks by splashing the Italian concession to immigrants on its front page under the headline Italian Daring It pointed out that the French government over a period of 18 months had given permission for only 80 000 illegal immigrants to stay in the country Corriere della Sera of Milan in a front page editorial compared favorably the German government s well prepared and well argued proposal although rejected by the voters of Hesse to grant German citizenship to more than half its 7 million resident foreigners with the Italian government s sudden immigration decree which it said could generate xenophobia and racism Such a crucial problem as immigration can only be confronted in a spirit of bipartisanship in which the government and the opposition undertake not to treat it as an ideological question or to use it as a political weapon Corriere said But La Repubblica of Rome a paper of center left persuasion like Italy s coalition government praised the open door policy as being beneficial to a country with a declining birth rate and an aging population L a Repubblica also prominently reported that following the collapse of negotiations for a joint venture with Italian Telecom Rupert Murdoch has decided to pull out of Italy which he had intended to be the base for his planned expansion into digital television across Europe Instead he made a Yalta Agreement with the French company Canal Plus to divide European pay television between them In an editorial La Repubblica said Murdoch blamed Italian antitrust legislation for his departure but in reality he was alarmed by Canal Plus acquisition of a 17 percent stake in his highly profitable British TV company Sky The position of British poet laureate made
