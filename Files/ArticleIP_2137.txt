 Over the past few months in my cross divisional capacity I have been formulating plans for Microsoft to operate as a real player in the NY LA Media and Entertainment nexus This is the first of a number of directives I plan to issue to that end As you are all aware Microsoft has moved heavily into media and our division is a key part of that strategy After six months of study I have determined through a ton of research and collaboration that one of the key elements missing in the Microsoft culture is some sense of the hype buzz style and attitude that are so key to success in the media and entertainment industries If we want to play with the big boys in LA and NY we have to dress like the big boys in LA and NY even if we are girls I hope that we will have your support in this effort to make us more competitive and Seattle a real hub for media and entertainment Effective immediately all media and editorial folks will conform to the following dress code 1 Wear more black My suggestion is that one piece of black clothing be immediately visible at all times Not only is it a good idea and slimming it can help us to identify the greater and greater numbers of editorial and media type folks now working on our RedWest campus I wouldn t be surprised if traditional Microsofties started incorporating our fashion sense as well Which brings me to 2 Polar fleece will be worn only under other items of clothing and only for the purpose of warmth on days that the thermometer in the cafeteria dips below freezing point at noon 3 Microsoft Training and Certification will immediately launch a new series of courses called Dressing for Media Each course will take only one morning to complete and I think that all will find it quite useful Pamela Lopez a new employee from Vogue will be leading the morning sessions for women and is spearheading creation of the Day to Evening Makeup Web site Though it was originally intended only for the internal audience we hope to eventually establish Pamela s Web site as a platform much like Expedia and to sell it to Revlon Maybelline etc The focus will be very much along the IDA gain insight make decisions take actions lines of the enhanced Service Journalism Mission that has been evangelized for our division Let s remember that it s not that Microsoft folks don t want to look chic it s just that they need help choosing which shade of blue eye shadow works this spring 4 Our next ISM Editorial Lead meeting will be an offsite to discuss Bringing Fashion to RedWest It will be at Barneys downtown 5 Our cafeteria contractor Marriott has agreed to allow ISM editorial folks to reserve tables upstairs in the Euro Cafe Involved with this is a major re org Chief latte puller Walter will be moving to a new and more appropriate position as maitre d stationed at the Building A entrance The company has agreed to purchase a limited number of white tablecloths real silver and nonrecyclable crystal Full time employees holding a blue ID card may reserve tables on a first come first served basis An orange contractor card automatically gets you seated in Siberia Sorry the tax laws You know 6 Prada and Gucci will be opening boutiques in the Microsoft Company Store Estimated date of arrival May 1998 but that could slip 7 We will have Casual Fridays like all other good media companies but that doesn t mean you should just slip back into your Office 97 jacket or that favorite Microsoft Bob T shirt 8 No shorts before Memorial Day 9 No Teva sandals after Labor Day 10 Hemp is not an approved fiber 11 College T shirts are not chic 12 If you re pulling an all nighter bring a change of clothing please 13 Gentlemen may remove their jackets if attending an offsite at GameWorks 14 Blue hair is appropriate only for those who have graduated from college in the previous 12 months 15 Security guard chic went out last year Displaying your Microsoft employee ID badge outside your clothing will not win you a place on Mr Blackwell s Best Dressed List and is no longer acceptable 16 Wear sunglasses preferably black inside Incognito is mandatory for media types And it s good cover when your eyes glaze over during discussions of SQL servers 17 Finally to raise our profile as media players Motorola StarTAC cell phones will be issued to all media employees However as part of our attempt to participate in Microsoft s program to control the cost beast they will not be connected for service
