 Background Estrogenic steroids regulate cellular function in a wide variety of tissues 1 During human pregnancy the production of 17 beta estradiol E2 rises eighty fold from 0 75 nM preovulatory peak to 60 nM at term 2 3 4 5 and estrogens influence various aspects of placental function and fetal development in humans and primates 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Several previous studies have shown that human placenta binds estradiol 13 14 15 However more recent immunohistochemical studies on paraffin embedded or snap frozen sections as well as other techniques RT PCR for ER alpha mRNA failed to demonstrate estrogen receptor alpha ER in human placentae during pregnancy or in cultures of dispersed placental cells 16 17 However it has been indicated that the failure to detect the ER does not entirely preclude the presence of this receptor in human trophoblast cells but might be attributed to a relatively low number and density of ER molecules on these cells 17 On the other hand Billiar et al reported identification of the ER in the nuclei of cultured human placental syncytiotrophoblast 18 To our knowledge no western blot analysis of placental ER expression has been previously described During the third trimester and after 34 36 weeks of pregnancy in particular the placenta may develop an abnormality often classified as placental aging 19 20 21 22 23 24 These abnormal placentae are characterized by generalized interstitial fibrosis and fibrinoid degeneration of villous stroma and are associated with cellular apoptosis and congestion of villous sinusoids 24 25 26 27 Immunohistochemically villous abnormality is associated with progressive diminution of Thy 1 differentiation protein in the villous core 28 Marked changes in villous structure are particularly associated with advanced maternal age 29 30 We have recently reported that with respect to the Thy 1 expression compensatory dilatation of villous sinusoids and placental expression of low molecular weight cyclin E variants the term placentae can be classified into four placental types PT1 PT4 30 where PT4 corresponds to the most severe placental abnormality These observations indicate that the term placenta is not a constant structure either morphologically or biologically Therefore expression of certain placental proteins including ER may vary Upon immunohistochemical staining ER is predominantly localized to cell nuclei However positive staining of ER in the cytoplasm can also be seen 31 32 33 It has been reported that cytoplasmic ER expression accompanied by a lack of nuclear staining is characteristic for immature cells nuclear ER indicates differentiating cells and complete lack of ER expression accompanies terminal differentiation of estrogen sensitive cells 33 In addition evidence for cell surface ER expression has been recently presented 34 Trophoblast cells are usually separated and grown in media containing phenol red PhR 35 Phenol red is a weak estrogen with apparent biological effects and the ER binding affinity in Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium DMEM is equivalent to levels of E2 as high as 0 45 nM 36 Although relatively low when compared to the E2 levels in pregnancy this estrogenic binding affinity of PhR is close to that of E2 during the preovulatory peak 4 5 Therefore we included studies with PhR PhR E2 and PhR E2 media in order to determine the effect of estrogens on differentiation of cultured trophoblast cells syncytium formation derived from normal and abnormal placental types Here we show for the first time that the ER protein is expressed in normal and marginally abnormal placentae normal placental types but barely detectable in placentae exhibiting moderate and severe abnormality abnormal placental types However all placental types showed distinct ER expression in trophoblast cultures Nuclear ER expression was confined to the villous and tissue culture mononucleated trophoblast cells but not syncytiotrophoblast layers DMEM with PhR stimulated differentiation of trophoblast cells from normal placental types but mid pregnancy levels of E2 significantly enhanced differentiation of cultured trophoblast cells derived from both normal and abnormal placentae Materials and Methods Tissues Ten placentae from deliveries between 33 and 41 weeks of pregnancy were investigated The source of placental tissue were women with normal and abnormal pregnancies admitted to the University of Tennessee Medical Center Six additional cases were studied for the effect of E2 on trophoblast differentiation Excluded were patients with blood transferable infections e g hepatitis and HIV and apparent ascendent placental infections Frozen tissue samples of ovarian cancer a tissue control for ER expression were obtained from NCI Cooperative Human Tissue Network Columbus Ohio MCF 7 breast carcinoma cells were maintained as indicated previously 37 and utilized as a cell culture positive control Rat kidneys for secondary antibody absorption were kindly supplied by Dr Roberto Dominguez Laboratory of Biology of Reproduction Facultad de Estudios Profesionales Zaragoza UNAM Mexico DF Mexico The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board An unusually detailed description of the methods utilized follows since placental ER expression is still a highly controversial issue Tissue processing and peroxidase immunohistochemistry All chemicals except where specified otherwise were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co St Louis MO The processing of the placenta started within 30 60 min after delivery Several 10 10 5 mm blocks of tissue were collected from different central cotyledons into cryomold biopsy vinyl specimens molds Tissue Tek Cryomold Biopsy Miles Inc Diagnostic Division Elkhart IN and embedded in an optimum cutting temperature formulation of watersoluble glycols and resins O C T compound Miles The molds with specimens were frozen by floating on liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C until use Frozen tissues were sliced into 7 m serial sections using a cryostat microtome with specimen retraction during return travel Carl Zeiss Microm HM 505 E MICROM Laborger te GmbH Waldorf Germany and ten to twelve distinct tissue sections were placed on each slide The slides were dried 2 h at room temperature fixed 5 min in acetone dried 30 min and stored at 4 C until immunoperoxidase staining was performed within two to four weeks Prior to staining the slides were transferred in a cold room 4 C into air protected boxes containing Drierite granules W A Hammond Drierite Co Ltd Xenia OH to prevent water condensation and the boxes with slides were equilibrated to room temperature before opening Slides were incubated overnight 4 C with affinity purified mouse anti human ER alpha monoclonal antibody 1 50 5 g ml clone h 151 This antibody was raised against a 14 residue synthetic peptide RAANLWPSPLMIKR based on the human estrogen receptor residues 287 300 and reacts specifically with the activated 4S ER alpha StressGen Biotechnologies Corp Victoria BC Another set of sections was similarly incubated with anti human ER monoclonal antibody ready to use without additional dilution clone ID5 DAKO Corporation Carpinteria CA As indicated by DAKO this antibody reacts with the N terminal domain A B region of the ER receptor but the antibody concentration is unknown not disclosed by DAKO upon request In immunoblotting this antibody reacts with the 67 kDa polypeptide chain obtained by transformation of E coli and transfection of COS cells with plasmid vectors expressing ER 31 32 We also used monoclonal mouse anti human Thy 1 antibody 1 100 5 g ml clone F15 42 01 38 Dr Rosemarie Dalchau of the Institute of Child Health University of London London England for the determination of placental type PT1 PT4 see below Control staining consisted of substitution of primary antibody with PBS or with 1 50 diluted recommended by the vendor anti human CD3 monoclonal antibody which is directed against the CD3 pan T cell marker DAKO This control staining was also used since the CD3 antibody specifically stains rare fetal T cells in the placental villi only but not other villous structures After several washes in PBS room temperature the sections were incubated with peroxidase labeled secondary antibody goat anti mouse IgG and IgM pre absorbed with human serum Jackson Immunoresearch West Grove PA diluted 1 50 and absorbed with rat kidney homogenate as described 39 Tissue sections were processed further as described previously

purpose of statistical analysis in this study the PT1 and PT2 placentae were coupled since they can be considered as normal placentae capable of responding and fulfilling the demands of the growing fetus by compensatory villous development or expansion of existing mature villi 30 They were compared with placental types showing moderate and severe abnormality coupled PT3 and PT4 Tissue lysates and western blot analysis For preparation of protein lysates from placental tissue and ovarian cancer for western blot analysis including control Cdk2 and normal rabbit immunoglobulin

of tissue sections containing 1 mM sodium orthovanadate 10 mM sodium fluoride and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride After 15 min on ice the lysates were sonicated using a SonicatorTM Cell Disruptor Heat Systems Ultrasonic Inc Plainview NY for 5 seconds and centrifuged at 11000 g for 20 min at 4 C Supernatants were stored at minus 80 C For western blot analysis protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay Bio Rad Hercules CA Equal amounts of unboiled protein 42 g were loaded onto reducing 10 SDS Tris glycine polyacrylamide gels transferred to nitrocellulose Bio Rad and processed as described previously 41 with some modifications Briefly two identical membranes were washed in Tris buffered saline containing 0 05 Tween 20 TBST and non specific binding sites were blocked by immersing the membrane in blocking reagent 0 5 casein in TBST for 1 hour at room temperature on an orbital shaker After blocking the membranes were briefly rinsed in two changes of TBST and washed once for 15 minutes and twice for 5 minutes in fresh changes of TBST One of two identical membranes was first subjected to overnight incubation 4 C with blocking reagent only control Another identical membrane second membrane was incubated overnight 4 C for ER clone h 151 0 1 g ml in blocking reagent Next the membranes were washed and incubated with peroxidase labeled secondary antibody goat anti mouse IgG and IgM Jackson Immunoresearch diluted 1 2000 for 1 hour at room temperature Before staining the secondary antibody was diluted 1 60 5 l 300 l absorbed with rat kidney homogenate 150 g 300 l for 20 min centrifuged and diluted to the final concentration 1 2000 This absorption eliminated any non specific background After incubation the membranes were washed 1 15 min 2 10 min and 4 5 min in fresh changes of TBST and incubated for 1 hour in blocking buffer at room temperature Bound antibodies were detected by a chemiluminescent detection system ECL Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Piscataway NJ as recommended by the manufacturer s protocol For exposure 1 min 5 min and up to 1 h we used Kodak XAR film Eastman Kodak Rochester NY Next the membranes were stripped in buffer containing 0 2 M glycine pH 2 2 0 1 SDS and 1 0 Tween 20 for 45 min washed and reprobed with antibodies raised against other proteins of interest e g the first membrane with ER antibody ID5 DAKO and the second membrane with actin mouse monoclonal antibody clone C4 Boehringer Mannheim Corp Indianapolis IN 0 25 g ml As indicated above the ID5 antibody is delivered ready to use for immunohistochemistry yet the antibody concentration is unknown For western blot analysis we diluted the ID5 antibody 1 50 Although the ID5 antibody identified a band similar to that detected by h 151 the staining was weaker see Fig 1 Therefore higher ID5 antibody concentration might be required for optimum outcomes in western blot analysis Immunoprecipitates IP Cdk2 and rabbit IgG IP were utilized as negative controls for ER antibodies Staining for cyclin E clone HE12 PharMingen San Diego CA served as a positive Cdk2 IP control For Cdk2 IP the Cdk2 M2 affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide mapping at the carboxy terminus of Cdk2 of human origin Santa Cruz Biotechnology Santa Cruz CA was utilized Equal amounts 200 g of protein from each sample were immunoprecipitated with 0 5 g Cdk2 antibody in 300 l IP buffer 50 mM Tris pH 7 5 5 mM EDTA 20 mM glycerol 150 mM NaCl 1 NP 40 and 25 l protein A G agarose beads Santa Cruz Biotechnology on an orbital shaker overnight at 4 C For IP control 0 5 g of normal rabbit IgG was used instead of anti Cdk2 rabbit polyclonal antibody Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation 11000 g for 10 min at 4 C washed three times with 500 l TG buffer containing 20 mM Tris 250 mM NaCl and 0 5 NP 40 For western blot analysis IP were resuspended in 20 l 2 SDS sample Laemmli buffer and the supernatants were resolved by SDS PAGE Cyclin E variants in Cdk2 IP were detected by probing with HE12 primary antibody PharMingen followed by goat anti mouse IgG and IgM Jackson Immunoresearch secondary antibody conjugated with horse radish peroxidase and visualized by a chemiluminescent detection system ECL Amersham Pharmacia Biotechnology and autoradiography as indicated above Next the membranes were stripped and probed with h 151 ER antibody as indicated above In parallel the western blots with original protein lysates were processed see Fig 2 Cell separation culture Placental tissue was digested and trophoblast cells isolated and cultured as described previously 41 with modifications Since the first digestion yielded only erythrocytes and some white blood cells and in the second digestion such cells were accompanied by only rare trophoblast cells the third supernatant was the first to be collected The remaining tissue was incubated 30 min at 37 C in 50 ml of normal DMEM PhR containing 25 mM HEPES and 4500 mg L glucose DMEM HG without trypsin and DNase 42 The supernatant was collected and the procedure repeated Collected cells were pooled washed twice in DMEM HG diluted to 10 ml in DMEM HG supplemented with heat inactivated 5 fetal bovine serum FBS Gibco BRL and antibiotics 50 g ml gentamycin 100 U ml penicillin and 100 g ml streptomycin and viable large nucleated cells 95 in trypan blue exclusion test were counted The procedure gave between 30 40 10 6viable trophoblast cells 35 g of placental tissue Cells were seeded in 60 mm Falcon Primaria petris Fisher Scientific Pittsburgh PA in the amount of 7 10 6per dish cells in 3 ml DMEM HG with 5 FBS antibiotics as above and cultured in an humidified atmosphere with 5 CO 2 at 37 C Cells were harvested for protein at 16 24 h early cultures and at 72 to 96 h late cultures The medium was changed every 24 hours During cultivation the differentiation of syncytium from cytotrophoblast cells was monitored daily and video images from several fields were stored in the computer for additional evaluation and presentation To prepare cell lysates cultures were washed twice with ice cold PBS lysed by adding ice cold lysis buffer and stored and processed for western blot analysis as indicated for tissue lysates above Along with cultures in petri dishes we established cultures in LabTek II 4 well glass slides Nalgene Nunc International Naperville Illinois The slide chambers were pre coated with 80 g ml of calf skin collagen dissolved in 0 15 NaCl with 50 g ml gentamycin Slides were incubated with 500 l of collagen solution per chamber for 72 h at 37 C dried for 2 h in an air flow box and stored in the original UV sterilized and air protected package at 4 C prior use The slide chambers were seeded with 4 10 5cells per well and utilized for immunohistochemical evaluation of ER expression during trophoblast differentiation Fig 4 Amnion fibroblast cell culture Amnion was carefully separated from the chorion laeve placed into dry petri dishes with epithelium facing the bottom allowed to adhere in the incubator for 1 h at 37 C cut into narrow strips and incubated for seven to nine days in the same medium used for trophoblast cultures with daily monitoring of fibroblast outgrowth The amnion was then removed and fibroblasts harvested after reaching 80 confluence and processed for western blot analysis Some fibroblasts were passaged as described for other cell types 37 seeded onto four chamber slides allowed to reach similar confluence and processed for immunohistochemistry with primary antibodies to fibroblast markers All cells exhibited staining for Thy 1 fibroblast differentiation protein vimentin and alpha actin and no staining with leukocyte common antigen antibody negative control data

Inc Minneapolis MN saved in Windows Bitmap and loaded into Scion Image Scion Corporation Loaded images were enlarged 16 and six 40 square pixel rectangle areas were measured above background and within each band crude values The measurements were copied into Microsoft Excel 2002 Microsoft Corporation and background values subtracted from crude measurements to obtain net optical density O D Net values were utilized for statistical calculations Extent of syncytium formation in PhR and E2 experiments see next paragraph was evaluated by a measurement of the area occupied by individual clusters The video images of clusters in tissue cultures six representative fields per time data point were saved in Windows Bitmap and loaded into Scion Image Scion Corporation Individual clusters were encircled using free hand tool and the area of each cluster measured Clusters exceeding the view area 90000 sq m were evaluated as the maximum area size 90000 Measurements of six clusters were utilized for statistical evaluation of each culture at a given time Effect of PhR and E2 on trophoblast differentiation Six additional cases were studied for the extent of syncytium formation under various estrogen influences Cells were grown in complete DMEM HG which contains 45 M phenol red PhR Phenol red binds to the ER with an affinity 0 001 that of E2 100 36 Hence the binding affinity of 45 M PhR is equivalent to 45 M 10 5 i e 0 45 nM E2 Other media were phenol red free DMEM HG without estrogens PhR E2 or phenol red free DMEM HG with 20 nM E2 PhR E2 This concentration of E2 corresponds to mid pregnancy E2 levels 5 Each medium was supplemented with 5 heat inactivated FBS The PhR E2 medium was prepared as previously described 37 Samples were harvested at time 0 just after separation

values of P 0 05 were considered significant Area of syncytial aggregates was similarly evaluated Results Control studies western blot analysis and immunoprecipitates Figures 1and 2 Figure 1shows ER protein expression at 65 kDa detected with two ER monoclonal antibodies in an amniotic fibroblast culture FBC lane 1 MCF 7 cells MCF lane 2 and a trophoblast culture TRC lane 3 The last lane is from an ovarian adenocarcinoma tissue sample AOvCa Since the h 151 antibody clone gave a stronger reaction it has been utilized in western blot analysis throughout the remainder of this study In Fig 2 the h 151 antibody identifies an ER band in cultured trophoblast cells and ovarian endometrioid carcinoma EOvCa lysates lanes 1 and 2 but no reactivity is apparent in rabbit anti Cdk2 IP lanes 3 and 5 The HE12 anti cyclin E antibody was utilized as a positive control for Cdk2 IP Immunoprecipitate with normal rabbit immunoglobulin lane 4 served as a negative IP control Placental types Table 1 During the last trimester of human pregnancy the placenta may exhibit pronounced abnormality associated with generalized villous degeneration often called placental aging or senescence 22 23 24 27 43 44 45 We have recently shown that placental abnormality is associated with the diminution of Thy 1 differentiation protein immunostaining in the villous core and less or more pronounced dilatation of villous sinusoids Based on these two criteria accompanied by changes in the expression of cyclin E cE low molecular weight protein variants four basic placental types can be recognized PT1 PT4 Table 1 Normal mature placentae placental type 1 PT1 show strong Thy 1 expression in the villous core and relatively small lumen of sinusoids expression of cE variants is low The PT1 can be viewed as placenta capable of fulfilling the demands of the growing fetus occasional villous regeneration and expansion of existing mature villi without requirement of adaptive dilatation of villous sinusoids Marginal irregularity the PT2 is characterized by significant diminution of Thy 1 staining and moderate but significant dilatation of villous sinusoids Cyclin E expression is highest in this placental type The PT2 can be viewed as placentae with villous and vascular adaptation to imminent placental aging enhanced villous regeneration and expansion accompanied by moderate dilatation of villous sinusoids Placentae showing further diminution of Thy 1 expression and excessive dilatation of villous sinusoids are classified as PT3 Cyclin E expression is higher compared to PT1 but lower compared to PT2 The PT3 can be viewed as placentae exhibiting advanced aging capable of compensating demands of the growing fetus only by extreme dilatation of villous blood sinusoids Finally in PT4 Thy 1 expression in terminal villi is very low but this is not accompanied by dilatation of villous sinusoids Cyclin E expression varies The PT4 can be viewed as placentae exhibiting villous immaturity either compensated by placental hypertrophy villous regeneration and expansion without maturation maternal diabetes mellitus PT4A or uncompensated placental atrophy associated with villous immaturity intrauterine growth retardation PT4B with apparent consequences for the newborn Further details are given in Ref 30 Altogether placental abnormality is not as simple as one might imagine e g just placental aging Table 1shows that abnormal placentae include either advanced placental aging with an excess of villous blood sinusoid dilatation PT3 or severe villous immaturity without significant dilatation of villous sinusoids PT4 Again the latter can be either compensated by placental hypertrophy normal Apgars associated with fetal macrosomia in maternal diabetes PT4A or uncompensated placental hypotrophy and associated with intrauterine growth retardation and apparent deterioration of the Apgar scores 30 PT4B Note that the Table 1also summarizes the data with respect to ER expression showing either strong expression of ER protein PT1 and PT2 or only traces PT3 and PT4 This supports a view that regardless of pathophysiology the intensity of in vivo ER expression can be utilized for discrimination between the two basic categories only the normal NP PT1 and PT2 and the abnormal placentae AP PT3 and PT4 Observations supporting this view follow Possible exceptions for PT1 are indicated in Table 1and in discussion Placental immunohistochemistry Figure 3 Figures 3Aand 3Bshow that h 151 and ID5 anti ER antibodies exhibit similar nuclear staining of MCF 7 cells no staining in the MCF 7 culture is apparent with control antibody recognizing CD3 of T cells Fig 3C The immunoreactivity of ID5 antibody is shown in Fig 3D 3E and G N In normal placentae the ER was strongly expressed in cytotrophoblast nuclei c Fig 3D lying beneath trophoblastic syncytium S which showed no staining of the nuclei Fig 3Eshows that cytotrophoblast cells merging with the syncytium exhibit a diminution of ER expression compare with 3D Such occasionally observed differentiation of cytotrophoblast cells was associated with weak cytoplasmic staining of the syncytium Yet the syncytial nuclei never exerted ER immunoreactivity S Fig 4E Control staining with CD3 antibody Fig 3F shows an isolated T cell in the villous core but no staining of other villous structures Substitution of primary antibody with PBS produced no staining not shown In addition to cytotrophoblast cells ER immunoreactivity was also detected in villous vessels and sinusoids v However this staining was not associated with the nuclei of endothelial cells black arrows Fig 3Gand 3H but with adjacent pericytes PC and white arrow Fig 3H i e cells originating from placental fibroblasts However cytotrophoblast cells with nuclear ER immunoreactivity were not detected in every placenta investigated Fig 3Ishows an abnormal placenta with a lack of ER staining except in the villous vessels Fig 3Jdemonstrates the ER staining of small resting fibroblasts persisting after vascular regression in some villi in the placenta shown in Fig 3I All placentae showed ER staining of resting fibroblasts beneath the amniotic epithelium Fig 3K but amniotic epithelium itself showed no immunoreactivity Fig 3L Unexpectedly no ER immunoreactivity was found in extravillous trophoblast cells and adjacent decidual cells either in chorion laeve Fig 3Mand 3N or at the placental basal plate not shown Fig 3Oshows staining for Thy 1 differentiation protein which allows discrimination between unstained extravillous trophoblast cells left and Thy 1 decidual cells right Note a lack of Thy 1 fibroblasts among extravillous trophoblast cells Trophoblast cultures Figure 4 Figure 4shows ER immunoreactivity in early 17 h and late 93 h trophoblast cultures derived from normal placenta In early cultures the dividing trophoblast cells exhibited surface ER expression arrow Fig 4A Non dividing trophoblast cells showed cytoplasmic perinuclear arrowhead Fig 4B or perinuclear nuclear ER immunoreactivity Fig 4C The latter was accompanied by diminution of cell surface staining Fig 4Dshows syncytium formation in the early culture with traces of cytoplasmic white arrowheads compare with panel 4E but no nuclear ER immunoreactivity Mature syncytia in late cultures showed no cytoplasmic or nuclear ER immunoreactivity Fig 4E Some late cultures derived from PT2 types showed a mixture of well developed syncytia and persisting mononucleated trophoblast cells with ER immunoreactivity However in late cultures from abnormal placentae the formation of syncytia was abortive see below and such small syncytia showed regressive changes and persisting cytoplasmic ER immunoreactivity not shown Variability of outcome in trophoblast cultures Figure 5 Figures 5shows that trophoblast cultures from normal placentae characterized by strong Thy 1 expression in the villous core panel A exhibit progressive formation of mid sized m and large syncytial aggregates l in early EC panel B and late cultures LC panel C In contrast trophoblast cultures from abnormal placentae which are characterized by weak or no Thy 1 expression in the villous core panel D exhibit abortive formation of small s syncytial aggregates panels E and F The ER expression in normal placentae is high top of inset A and transformation of cytotrophoblast cells into the large syncytia 300 m in diameter is accompanied by ER diminution top insets B and C see also Fig 4E On the other hand abnormal placentae show almost no ER expression in vivo top inset Fig 5D However strong ER expression is apparent in early culture top inset E and persists thereafter top inset F apparently due to the lack of mature syncytium formation Bottom insets show actin expression Quantitative evaluation and statistical analysis of ER expression in the placentae and trophoblast cultures are shown in Fig 5G error bars indicate SD Nonparametric ANOVA was extremely significant P 0 0001 Dunn s Multiple Comparisons Test indicated a significant difference in ER expression between normal placenta PT1 in vivo vs corresponding late culture PT1 LC P 0 01 Normal placenta PT1 in vivo showed significantly higher ER expression when compared to PT4 in vivo P 0 001 Trophoblast cultures from PT4 showed a high increase when compared to the PT4 in vivo P 0 01 but there was no significant difference when the PT4 early and late cultures were compared However late PT1 culture PT1 LC showed significantly lower ER vs both PT4 cultures P 0 05 This correlated with differences in syncytium formation Fig 5Cvs 5F Variability of placental ER expression Figure 6 In western blot analysis of the ten placental samples investigated five showed a distinct ER band at 65 kDa and five exhibited barely detectable ER expression Fig 6A Note that in Fig 6A the placentae with strong ER expression belong to the PT1 normal or PT2 slightly abnormal types while placentae with low ER expression belong to the PT3 and PT4 types moderate and severe abnormality For statistical purposes in this study the PT1 normal and PT2 placentae slightly abnormal with compensatory villous differentiation were coupled as normal placentae NP The PT3 moderate abnormality compensated by maximum dilatation of sinusoids and PT4 placentae severe abnormality without compensatory vascular dilatation were coupled as abnormal placentae AP Figures 6Band 6Cdemonstrate ER expression in early and late trophoblast cultures Interestingly the PT2 in lane 2 shows a diminution of ER expression already at early culture possibly due to the accelerated syncytium formation already activated in vivo 30 Fig 6Dsummarizes the data on ER expression in all ten placentae and cultures presented in panels 6A C It is apparent that high ER expression in normal placentae in vivo was relatively constant yet there were marked differences among trophoblast cultures ranging from ER diminution to persisting ER expression Indeed only a small proportion of trophoblast cultures from PT2 placentae showed complete transformation of cytotrophoblast cells into the syncytia while in others mature syncytia were accompanied by cytotrophoblast cells Nonparametric ANOVA for Fig 6Dwas extremely significant P 0 0001 Dunn s Multiple Comparisons Test indicated significant difference in ER expression between NP in vivo when compared to AP in vivo P 0 01 Estrogen receptor alpha expression in AP in vivo was also significantly lower compared to all other columns at P 0 001 Interestingly the ER expression in AP early and late cultures significantly exceeded that of NP in vivo P 0 001 Altogether very low in vivo ER expression in all moderately and severely abnormal placentae rose significantly several fold in early cultures and high expression remained unchanged in late cultures This correlated with poor development of syncytial aggregates The role of E2 in terminal differentiation of trophoblast cells Figures 7and 8 Trophoblast cultures from six additional term placentae were studied for trophoblast differentiation in normal DMEM HG medium with phenol red PhR in phenol red free medium without E2 PhR E2 and in phenol red free medium with 20 nM E2 PhR E2 Three placentae were classified as normal two PT1 and one PT2 and three as abnormal two PT3 and one PT4 All time 0 freshly isolated trophoblast cells and early cultures showed distinct ER bands regardless of the absence E2 or presence of E2 or PhR in the media during trophoblast separation and regardless of their origin from normal or abnormal placentae Late cultures showed lower ER expression in cell lysates from normal placentae when compared to that from abnormal placentae data not shown Trophoblast cells from normal placentae cultured in PhR medium formed mid sized syncytial clusters in early cultures and large syncytial clusters in late cultures l Fig 7A see also Fig 5Band 5C The same cells cultured in PhR E2 medium showed a retardation of syncytium formation in early and late cultures where they did not exceed clusters of small size s Fig 7B Trophoblast cells divided short arrows and associated together yet often without fusing long arrow Fig 7B However PhR E2 medium caused marked acceleration of trophoblast differentiation in early cultures where the syncytial clusters already reached a large size In addition late cultures showed formation of extremely large syncytial aggregates xl Fig 7C Trophoblast cells from abnormal placentae AP cultured in PhR medium formed small syncytial clusters in early cultures and rare mid sized clusters in late cultures m Fig 7D see also Fig 5Eand 5F The same cells cultured in PhR E2 medium showed severe retardation of syncytium formation in early and late cultures Fig 7E However PhR E2 medium stimulated trophoblast differentiation in early and late cultures where syncytial aggregates reached a large size Fig 7F Fig 8summarizes the data on the extent of syncytium formation in late trophoblast cultures from three NP and three AP studied It is apparent that PhR media stimulated syncytium formation in NP but not AP Lack of estrogens PhR E2 caused retardation and E2 supplementation stimulated syncytium formation in trophoblast cultures derived from both normal and abnormal placentae Nonparametric ANOVA for Fig 8was extremely significant P 0 0001 Dunn s Multiple Comparisons Test indicated significant differences in ER expression at P 0 01 as indicated by different column superscripts in Fig 8 Note that the measurement of extra large syncytium aggregates in NP PhR E2 see xl Fig 7C was limited by a maximum view area representing 90000 sq m see Materials and Methods Altogether E2 appears to stimulate terminal differentiation of trophoblast cells derived from normal and abnormal placentae both expressing ER in vitro and to enhance a fusion of syncytial clusters into extremely large aggregates The presence of phenol red a weak estrogen in the culture is sufficient to stimulate differentiation of trophoblast cells into large syncytia in cultures from normal placentae but not from abnormal ones Discussion This is the first demonstration of ER protein expression in human placentae by western blot analysis Nuclear ER expression was confined to the villous mononucleated trophoblast cells associated with trophoblastic syncytium and differentiating cultured cytotrophoblast cells No nuclear ER staining was detected in trophoblastic syncytia in vivo or in vitro Unexpectedly extravillous trophoblast cells also lacked ER These observations indicate that trophoblastic nuclear ER expression is characteristic of cytotrophoblast cells differentiating into syncytial structures but not for resting cytotrophoblast cells Additional placental cell types expressing the ER were fibroblast derived vascular pericytes and extravillous amniotic fibroblasts Estrogens may via the ER contribute to the stimulation of terminal differentiation of mononucleated trophoblast cells into syncytial aggregates Terminal trophoblast differentiation is associated with diminution of ER expression Nuclear ER expression is characteristic of estrogen sensitive cells which might be stimulated by estrogens to proliferate as well as modulate differentiated functions In placental material ER expression determined by western blot analysis showed either strong ER or barely detectable ER bands and where investigated there were no transitions between these two types of ER expression In addition strong ER expression was associated with normal placentae PT1 and PT2 suggesting that in these term pregnancies ER cytotrophoblast cells contribute to syncytium differentiation On the other hand placentae exhibiting moderate and severe abnormality showed virtually no ER expression by western blot analysis or immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections except the vessels This indicates there is no syncytium differentiation although the senescent placentae of females of advanced maternal age were reported to exhibit a higher number of Ki 67 dividing mononuclear trophoblast cells 29 These observations suggest that dividing cytotrophoblast cells do not necessarily contribute to syncytium differentiation and may not express ER An unexpected feature was the strong ER expression of cultured trophoblast cells derived from placentae deficient in ER expression in vivo This observation indicates that the lack of ER expression in vivo is not due to the inability of trophoblast cells to express ER in general It might be speculated that under conditions of tissue culture factors modulating ER expression are different from that in vivo Given that ER expression is already enhanced at the end of the cell separation time 0 ER expression appears to be inhibited in vivo Virtual lack of in vivo ER expression seems to be an additional indicator of moderate and severe placental abnormality Based on in vivo ER expression the placentae may be divided into the two basic categories normal placentae NP ER and abnormal placentae AP ER However it should be considered that some PT1 placentae the functions of which are in harmony with actual fetal demands may not exhibit compensatory differentiation of trophoblast cells and therefore may not express ER in vivo Table 1 The existence of placental aging is still debated yet various clinical morphological cellular and molecular aspects of placental senescence have been indicated 20 21 24 25 27 28 29 30 45 46 47 However it is still unclear if there are any consequences of placental aging for normal pregnancy delivery and neonatal birth weight and Apgar scores 29 48 49 It has to be noted that even the abnormal placenta may have the capacity to improve its function and compensate for demands of the growing fetus e g by elongation and excessive dilatation of villous sinusoids 26 50 As recently indicated 30 certain types of placental abnormality have also been ascribed to the villous immaturity low or no Thy 1 differentiation protein expression in placental villi and a lack of blood sinusoid dilatation PT4 see above accompanied by an existing diabetes mellitus or absent placental hypertrophy intrauterine growth retardation Table 1 However it has been suggested that although chronic placental adaptations may be successful for the fetal survival e g in placental senescence or maternal diabetes they may lead to adverse outcomes later in the life of an individual 22 Therefore although it might not be apparent in the newborn the abnormal placenta may indicate a burden for the future of an individual and for the quality of the human population Yet placental abnormality is not a rare event since it has been found in 50 of the cases in our material The second cell type expressing the ER were amniotic fibroblasts and fibroblast derived vascular pericytes Estrogen receptors have been identified in cultured fibroblasts of various origins and vascular smooth muscle cells 51 52 53 Estrogens enhance proliferation of fibroblasts and inhibit vascular smooth muscle migration 54 55 Binding of estrogens to fibroblasts also stimulates fibroblast interaction with epithelial cells with subsequent acceleration of maturation of epithelial cells 56 The last observation is of particular importance to several aspects of this study Activated Thy 1 villous fibroblasts characterized by secretion of Thy 1 differentiation protein among epithelial cells in vivo and among cultured trophoblast cells in vitro 57 58 are present in PT1 and PT2 but absent from PT3 and PT4 placentae 30 see also Fig 5Avs 5D Various types of placental mesenchymal cells inevitably accompany purified trophoblast cells 41 and highly activated Thy 1 fibroblasts are present in early trophoblast cultures 58 Extravillous trophoblast cells do not express ER yet indeed there are no Thy 1 fibroblasts among the basal plate and chorion laeve extravillous trophoblast cells see Fig 3O Hence Thy 1 fibroblasts may stimulate differentiation and ER expression in mononucleated trophoblast cells Although estrogens were suspected to stimulate trophoblast differentiation 12 59 no direct proof has been provided up to date Trophoblast cells derived from normal placentae differentiated into large syncytial clusters in the presence of PhR without E2 supplementation Phenol red in tissue culture media is a weak estrogen sufficient to stimulate the proliferation of ER MCF 7 human breast carcinoma cells 36 We report a similar estrogenic effect of PhR media on trophoblast differentiation and syncytium formation in cultures from normal placentae but not from abnormal ones Because trophoblast cultures derived from both the normal and abnormal placentae were ER in time 0 cell lysates the above difference can not be ascribed to the lack of ER expression Yet ER at mid pregnancy levels further stimulated syncytium development as evidenced by the development of extremely large syncytial aggregates in late cultures from normal placentae and development of large syncytial aggregates in cultures from abnormal placentae Hence trophoblast cells from abnormal placentae are also capable of differentiating in response to estrogenic stimuli but the level of estrogens must be higher However it is important to note that pharmacological levels of E2 200 nM have been found to suppress development of syncytial aggregates even in cultures derived from normal placentae unpublished data Hence either low or extremely high levels of estrogens in vivo may cause a suppression of placental syncytium formation Our observations indicate that the cultures from normal and abnormal placentae contain similar trophoblast cells capable of differentiating in response to exogenous estrogens but they may differ in the ability of accompanying mesenchymal cells to promote this process One might speculate that in cultures derived from normal placentae the weak estrogenic effect of PhR is sufficient to stimulate trophoblast mesenchymal cell interactions in vitro resulting in a local production of estrogens It is possible that the estrogens can be secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast clusters and fibroblasts because these cell types express the enzyme aromatase 60 Indeed trophoblast cultures are capable of producing estrogens 35 The data are summarized in Table 2 Our observations rise a fundamental question if E2 is not in fact an essential input for trophoblast differentiation Yet previous experience has shown that lower estrogen levels during pregnancy are indicative of poor fetal condition 5 Conclusion Placental ER expression in vivo is high in normal placentae and barely detectable in abnormal placentae The significant increase of estrogen production occurring with pregnancy advancement may play a role via the ER in the stimulation of terminal differentiation of mononucleated trophoblast cells into syncytial aggregates and promote placental function This mechanism however may not operate in abnormal placentae which show a lack of ER expression
