 Hollywood Party The party for the Golden Globe nominees was high up in Beverly Hills I had been invited by a woman who has lived in Los Angeles for almost 20 years and is now a noted Hollywood anthropologist As we rounded a turn a pair of big metal gates appeared before us Behind them set on the crest of a hill was a large white house in the contemporary Californian style In front of the gates a dozen or so young men stood around in dark uniforms I thought for a moment that they were a brass band but they turned out to be the valet parkers I was just realizing why the Californian unemployment rate is so low when a dark Ford Windstar minivan pulled up next to us We climbed in and were driven approximately 30 yards to the steps of the house where we got out again The front door was opened by yet more valets and we were bidden inside The hosts veteran studio executive Mike Medavoy and his wife Irina were there to greet us Mike a black V neck jumper and open necked shirt covering his ample torso looked like he had just stepped off the 18 th green Irina it must be said didn t A striking blonde she was wearing high heels velvet trousers and a black cardigan that my escort helpfully described as a peekaboo top As I struggled manfully to avoid staring at her cleavage she explained that the house had been built four years ago and that she had redecorated it throughout What she didn t say understandably was that the house had been built for her husband s previous wife Patricia Duff who had used it to throw fund raisers for her powerful friends in the Democratic Party Then Patricia left Mike and took up with Ron Perelman the Republican leaning financier At about the same time that Mike lost Patricia he also lost his job as head of TriStar Pictures Even here where the locals are used to ups and downs of a personal and business nature that was considered quite a twofer According to my date the real purpose of the party was to mark Medavoy s return to the big leagues As chairman of the suitably named Phoenix Pictures he is once more making films including one that might win an Oscar The People vs Larry Flynt And in Irina he has a new wife who while she might not have his ex s political clout has just as much glamour and sex appeal If prestige in Hollywood is measured in pulling power then Medavoy is definitely back on top Looking around the first person I saw was Sean Penn He was standing alone in a corner clad in black jeans black T shirt and black leather jacket I was thinking what a good job he was doing of playing up to his image as a brooding misfit when a bathroom door opened next to him and a 3 year old girl walked out and jumped into his arms He smiled broadly mumbled fatherly nothings into his daughter s ear and carried her upstairs Hollywood s gone baby my date whispered Moving further into the house I felt the same sense of surprise that I always feel in the presence of movie celebrities surprise that they look so familiar Here was James Woods talking a million miles a minute to Anthony Minghella the director of The English Patient and appearing for all the world like he was playing the manic Richard Boyle in Salvador There was Gabriel Byrne nursing a Heineken every inch the handsome villain of The Usual Suspects And here was Jeff Goldblum angular and geeky looking like he had just stepped out of that helicopter in Jurassic Park He was just back from Hawaii where he had been filming The Lost World the sequel to that monster smash What s the plot Jeff I asked casually as if I had known him all my life It s a big secret he replied Oh come on my date insisted Well they tempt me to go back to an island where there are more dinosaurs What sort of dinosaurs Stegosaurs the fat ones with ripples on their back The Medavoys house is beautiful with large airy rooms and white walls covered with modern art On virtually every surface are photographs of the Medavoys with famous people Mike in the Oval Office with Bill Clinton Mike with Ronald Reagan Mike with Richard Nixon with Nelson Mandela with Al Gore with Barbra Streisand with Henry Kissinger The only notable absentee was his former wife In the drawing room we ran into another tall actor James Cromwell who recently appeared in The People vs Larry Flynt When he heard I was a writer Cromwell told me that he had just finished writing a novel What s it about I asked Contact he replied Pardon Contact the shadow what separates us from our destiny Contact You mean alien contact He nodded The spaceship in the New Mexico desert and all that You think we have been contacted by life from other planets He nodded again and said Yes Regularly Ever since 1947 You just have to look on the Internet There are 10 or 20 sightings a month Iwent outside for a drink The stone flagged veranda was roughly the size of a baseball diamond and it seemed to overlook the whole of Los Angeles which was a mosaic of orange and white lights At the bar I found myself next to two nondescript youths who were chugging down a couple of beers You re really popular in Europe man one said to the other Yeah the English and French really like me Japan too Yeah Japan too I m a big star in Japan I ve won lots of awards and shit over there It s really weird My eavesdropping was interrupted by a loud cry from inside the house When I got there I found myself next to the hostess What happened she asked Somebody ran down the stairs on their hands came the answer from the crowd My God somebody ran down the stairs on their hands in my house she shrieked clearly delighted The party was now in full swing Belatedly I realized that a lot of people in the house were foreigners My date explained that this is always the case at awards parties these days She said the Hollywood studios have largely given up producing serious movies so they have to rely on Europeans and antipodeans to make films that won t embarrass the industry when the Oscars come around Unfortunately many members of the academy have never heard of a lot of these foreign movies so there is an event every January called the Golden Globe Awards to tell them what films to watch before they vote Scott Hicks the director of Shine is one of the beneficiaries of this shift Having just got off a 16 hour flight from Adelaide the longhaired Aussie seemed somewhat bemused by all the fuss I m trying to figure out what it is about Shine that appeals to people so much he told me I really don t know I asked Hicks whether he was planning to move to Hollywood but he said he was wary of repeating the experiences of other young foreign directors who have tried it such as Neil Jordan and Mike Figgis They tend to have a huge cock up and leave Hicks said For now he added he was determined to enjoy the moment So were Alan Parker the director of Evita and Mike Leigh the director of Secrets and Lies When I ran across the two Brits they were knocking back the white wine and discussing that most English of subjects the class system Parker and Leigh are both self made men and supporters of the British Labor Party but Parker has worked primarily in Hollywood for almost two decades whereas Leigh stayed in London to make his low budget films Although they admire each other s work this was clearly a point of some tension between them Mike Leigh knows sod all about the working class Parker said to me apropos of nothing Fortunately Leigh didn t hear that slur I asked him how much money it took to produce Secrets and Lies Three million quid he said proudly By this stage the belle of the ball had finally arrived Courtney Love who stars in The People vs Larry Flynt At least I think it was Courtney Love To be honest she didn t look anything like the grunge singer I remembered from MTV She was thinner some of her facial features appeared to have changed shape her blond hair was curled and she was wearing a beautiful white maxi with a flowered pattern on it I vaguely recalled something about her appearing in Vogue recently but this was less a fashion makeover and more a transmogrification I was too frightened to approach Courtney but Mike Leigh wasn t He walked around in a circle inspecting her as if she were a prize steed What s this he asked pointing to a dramatic red and black tattoo that covered most of her right shoulder Oh it s from my death rock phase she replied The rest of the evening is something of a blur to me At some point my date appeared and said it was time to go It was almost midnight which is considered late in Los Angeles On the way out we passed Mike Medavoy He was sitting on the staircase with Irina on one side of him and Julia Ormond the beautiful British actress on the other Way to go Mike
