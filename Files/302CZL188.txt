lines artists typically draw to represent a loon s wake come alive As we look into the sun all is a silvery glitter a captivating light show with this one color Rounding a bend with the sun now behind us the show suddenly transforms to green moss yellow sand blue green conifers Next bend back to silver And at every upwelling of currents interruptive tree trunk or cat s paw of wind those silver lines intensify It s the quintessential Adirondack scene a favorite of Winslow Homer But to be on the Raquette in springtime pleases more than the eye You are also drenched in birdsong And as you share this bliss this sense of place with the AUDUBON writer who actually experienced it you begin to understand why we must preserve this beauty that is our heritage Lonq live Spring Creek Prairie Just outside Lincoln Nebraska there s a 610 acre tract anyone would love to call home It s called Spring Creek Prairie and it s absolutely beautiful Problem is its acres of rare tallgrass prairie wetlands springs ponds and pristine creek and woods are already home to an abundance of wildlife and North America s migratory birds Plus Native American artifacts are plentiful and ruts created by covered wagon traffic on the Oregon Trail are still clearly visible To save this precious historical land from developers Audubon worked with a local bank and purchased this land for preservation In turn Audubon will apply for a grant so birds and wildlife will continue to flourish and so that children and adults can come and enjoy this rare tract in all its natural splendor In Washington s Wind River Forest you float above ancient firs and hemlocks in a construction crane gondola 20 stories high You re cruising one of the least explored realms on earth the intricate web of life in the forest canopy On Martha s Vineyard off Cape Cod you scan the pre dawn pine forest with a high tech microphone to solve a bioacoustic mystery Why this island s chickadees sing a different song from all other chickadees in the U S You share adventures like these in every AUDUBON issue exploring nature s frontiers with today s most intrepid researchers Finding his woods infested with an endangered species the red cockaded woodpecker a North Carolina landowner launched a preemptive strike He simply clear cut 600 acres of longleaf pine There would be no more wood therefore no woodpeckers therefore no annoying government regulations limiting his property rights just to protect a bird Yet even this angry landowner wound up living happily ever after with the Endangered Species Act That s because the in genius Safe Harbor Plan made the conservation worth his while This plan is one more reason to preserve the perennially endangered Endangered Species Act the most effective wildlife law ever passed
