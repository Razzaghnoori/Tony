 Background Bacillus anthracis contains a 96 2 kb plasmid pXO2 that is required to cause the disease anthrax 1 Complete sequencing and annotation GeneMark hmm of pXO2 predicted 85 open reading frames ORFs Genbank accession NC_002146 Little is known about the identity and function of pXO2 ORFs beyond the virulence genes associated with the B anthracis capsule dep capACB acpA 2 3 4 5 The goal of this study was to determine if many of the novel pXO2 ORFs were unique to B anthracis or were conserved in other closely related Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis isolates Conservation of plasmid sequences can provide clues about the origin of the pXO2 plasmid and about potentially conserved gene functions Identification of ORFs that are specific to B anthracis are potentially useful as markers for detection of the pathogen in clinical and forensic applications B anthracis is a member of the B cereus B thuringiensis phylogenetic group 6 The members of this group are nearly indistinguishable by 16S rDNA analysis 7 8 Plasmids in the B cereus B thuringiensis isolates vary greatly in number and size and many of the phenotypic differences among B cereus B thuringiensis and B anthracis isolates are conferred by plasmid encoded genes 9 10 11 12 Horizontal plasmid transfer among bacteria including isolates of the B cereus thuringiensis group has been documented 12 13 14 15 16 Amplified fragment length polymorphism AFLP analysis of over 350 B cereus B thuringiensis and B anthracis isolates identified several distinct isolate groups 17 18 Eight of the B cereus B thuringiensis isolates were found to be very closely related to all B anthracis isolates and formed a distinct cluster In the present study B cereus and B thuringiensis isolates that vary in AFLP based genomic relatedness to B anthracis were examined for the presence of DNA sequence similar to pXO2 to determine whether portions of this plasmid are conserved in closely related Bacillus isolates and to determine whether the conservation of pXO2 sequences correlated with genomic relatedness established by AFLP comparisons 17 18 Results and Discussion PCR was performed using template DNA from 11 Bacillus isolates that vary in relatedness to B anthracis with primer sets designed to amplify DNA fragments from 47 different pXO2 ORFs This method was chosen to detect sequences with potential similarity to pXO2 because it is rapid and the reaction products can be readily sequenced Table 1lists the isolates tested their genomic relatedness to B anthracis as determined by Jaccard distances calculated from AFLP profile comparisons 17 18 and the number of positive PCR reactions obtained for each isolate DNA sequencing of the amplified PCR products revealed a high degree of sequence similarity to pXO2 ORFs Genbank accession numbers AF547271 AF547318 BLAST blastn e values were 6 10 13or less for each ORF fragment detected which corresponded to sequence similarity of 80 or greater In a previous study a similar approach was used to demonstrate that many of the ORFs from pXO1 the toxin encoding plasmid of B anthracis were highly conserved in other isolates from the B cereus B thuringiensis group 19 The number of plasmid ORFs detected in a Bacillus isolate did not correlate directly with phylogenetic relationship to B anthracis as determined by AFLP The isolates most closely related to B anthracis as determined by AFLP produced no more than two PCR products each However two of the more distantly related isolates B thuringiensis 33679 and B thuringiensis AWO6 produced 10 and 16 positive PCR reactions respectively Neither of these isolates is known to be a human or animal pathogen Table 2lists the 47 pXO2 ORFs that were tested in the PCR assay their putative functions or similarities to other genes blastp and the PCR results obtained in this experiment Nineteen different pXO2 ORF fragments were detected among the 11 Bacillus isolates Eight of the conserved ORFs were similar to sequences contained in public databases 11 were unidentified The only pXO2 ORFs found in common with the isolates most closely related to B anthracis Jaccard distance of 0 55 or less were ORFs 47 and 48 These ORFs have sequence similarity to a conserved hypothetical protein found in several bacterial genera and the tetR family of transcriptional repressors respectively A 25 3 kb region that contains the capsule associated genes has sequence characteristics that are different from the rest of the plasmid This region of pXO2 spans nucleotides 48242 73500 and includes ORFs 53 through 65 13 ORFs In comparison to the rest of pXO2 this region has a larger average gene size 818 bases vs 725 bases a lower gene density 0 5 gene vs 1 0 gene per kb of sequence and larger average intergenic spaces 1125 bases vs 260 bases The region also has a slightly lower percent G C 28 than the rest of the plasmid 31 Although the region is not bracketed by IS elements or tRNAs that are characteristic of pathogenicity islands PAIs it bears features that are similar to the putative PAI identified in the B anthracis plasmid pXO1 20 Bacterial sequences with similarity to the B anthracis cap genes are present in sequence databases However the capsule associated genes capABC dep acpA were not detected by PCR in the tested Bacillus isolates The pXO2 ORF sequences detected in B thuringiensis 33679 and B thuringiensis AWO6 were distributed across the entire plasmid sequence except in the 25 3 kb cap gene containing region which appeared to be unique to B anthracis B thuringiensis strain AWO6 produced the most products in the PCR assay A hybridization assay was performed using total genomic DNA from this isolate as a probe against pXO2 DNA targets amplified using the 47 primer sets from the PCR assay Table 3 The hybridization assay complimented the PCR analysis by identifying nine additional conserved ORF sequences that might not have had exact matches to the PCR primer sequences Total genomic DNA from B thuringiensis strain AWO6 hybridized with 23 pXO2 ORF fragments including all ORFs tested in the region between ORF 5 and ORF 38 Table 3 ORFs in the 25 3 kb pXO2 cap gene containing region did not hybridize with B thuringiensis strain AWO6 DNA B thuringiensis AWO6 is a strain containing a 70 kb plasmid designated pAW63 12 21 This strain was derived from B thuringiensis HD73 by curing of its crystal toxin bearing plasmid pHT73 12 21 The pAW63 plasmid contains a replication complex that is classified as a member of the pAMB 1 family of theta replicating plasmids that are present in a broad range of Gram positive species 22 Plasmid pXO2 also appears to be a pAMB1 like theta replicating plasmid 23 and elements surrounding the replication complex are present in both pXO2 and pAW63 see pXO2 ORFs 35 37 38 39 in Tables 2and 3 ORFs 35 37 and 38 were sufficiently conserved between pXO2 and pAW63 to allow detection by PCR or hybridization see Tables 2and 3 Pulsed field gel electrophoresis was used to separate plasmid and chromosomal DNA in B thuringiensis AWO6 and a Southern hybridization blot using a mixed pool of pXO2 derived probes ORFs 6 10 50 63 72 81 was performed to determine if any of the ORFs were present on the pAW63 plasmid Figure A DNA fragment estimated to be 72 kb in size hybridized to the mixed pXO2 probe which is slightly larger but within 3 of the reported size of pAW63 70 kb This same PFGE protocol produced a similarly accurate measurement of the size of the B anthracis plasmid pXO1 as determined by complete DNA sequencing 19 The detection of sequences similar to pXO2 ORFs on pAW63 suggests that other pXO2 genes in addition to those involved with replication are also located on the pAW63 plasmid Conclusions The presence of pXO2 ORF sequences in 11 Bacillus isolates did not correlate with their genomic relatedness to B anthracis as determined by AFLP comparisons A similar observation was made in previous work that examined the conservation of the B anthracis plasmid pXO1 among closely related bacteria 19 This study explored the extent of sequence conservation between pXO2 ORFs and total DNA from other Bacillus isolates and detected similar sequences that may be located on the chromosome or any of several plasmids in each isolate The two isolates with the most sequence conservation with pXO2 ORFs B thuringiensis isolates 33679 and AWO6 are known to contain large plasmids 12 19 Four ORFs with high sequence similarity to B thuringiensis AWO6 plasmid pAW63 were detected 22 and a mixed pXO2 ORF probe hybridized with a PFGE fragment similar in size to pAW63 The presence of considerable sequence conservation in more distantly related isolates rather than among close relatives combined with the observations stated above is a pattern consistent with the potential plasmid location of these sequences Comparative sequence analysis of these large plasmids with pXO2 could determine if the observed sequence conservation was located on these plasmids Methods Bacterial isolates and DNA isolation The genomes of the 11 Bacillus isolates selected for study were found by AFLP analysis to vary in relatedness to B anthracis Isolates with Jaccard distances of less than 0 55 formed a distinct cluster with all of the B anthracis isolates P J Jackson
