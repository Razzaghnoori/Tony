 Mental Health Care for Republican Candidates For some reason I find it easier to think about Relenza and antibiotics right about now than ugh another Republican debate tonight What colorful tie will Orrin Hatch break out as he talks about himself in the third or perhaps by now the fourth person How many boxes will Gary Bauer be standing on Will Alan Keyes finally go back on his medication OK I ll admit it I almost never read the Los Angeles Times I ll tell you sometime the whole reason it has to do with finding out how the paper is edited but there was a cute story in there today about the police arresting seven people for feeding the homeless in downtown s Pershing Square The police explained that the seven were interfering with the temporary ice skating rink Now it helps to understand that there is no more desolate example of urban renewing a place into the ground in all of Los Angeles than the once charming Pershing Square Green space was removed attracted the homeless My nomination for the unspoken issue of the year in both parties debates is what does society do with the mentally ill that we kicked out of mental hospitals two or three decades ago and who have become willy nilly the homeless Not to mention the fact that a history of mental problems turns up in the r sum s of more and more troublemakers like the guy who attacked George Harrison last week Just saw a news conference featuring Jesse Ventura and Donald Trump and it makes me salivate with anticipation of the Reform Party convention this summer Those two plus the Buchanan brigade personally I hope it s in Long Beach so I can drive down there but wherever it is it ll be the summer s best show Did you hear the story about Monica Lewinsky s sending notes to the White House recently Can t quite pin it down heard it on Paul Harvey which doesn t say much for its accuracy but hey those airbeds are great But on the subject of those gals if I paid the kind of money Linda Tripp s supporters must have paid for her makeover I d be expecting the surgeon to keep his mouth shut It s been a variety of fun Thanks for the ride Harry
