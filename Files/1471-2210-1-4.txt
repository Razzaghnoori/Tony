 Background The lower urinary tract serves to store and periodically eliminate urine The activity of the urinary bladder and the external urethral sphincter must be properly coordinated in order for continence to be maintained and timely micturition to occur Effective micturition requires the coordination of central and peripheral nervous system structures that activate sympathetic parasympathetic and somatic motor pathways innervating the bladder and the urethra for a recent review see 1 Pathophysiological conditions and pharmacological manipulations that affect central and or peripheral nervous system structures involved in micturition may alter the function of these two organs 2 Atypical antipsychotic neuroleptic agents are favored over traditional antipsychotic medication e g haloperidol because of their lower incidence of extrapyramidal side effects their greater efficacy in improving negative symptoms of schizophrenia and their effectiveness in treating schizophrenic patients not responding to conventional neuroleptics 3 However side effects continue to pose a challenge to effective treatment 4 These novel neuroleptics display a complex pharmacological profile with affinities for several receptor systems but are generally characterized by a greater affinity for the 5 HT2A receptor than for the target of the traditional neuroleptics the D2 receptor 4 5 We have shown recently that the atypical antipsychotic clozapine and to a lesser extent haloperidol markedly influenced several micturition parameters in anesthetized rats 6 Clozapine decreased the micturition volume while increasing bladder capacity thus increasing residual volume 7 Moreover clozapine profoundly depressed the activity of the external urethral sphincter EUS Clozapine abolished the electromyogram EMG recorded from the EUS during the rising phase of a bladder contraction before urine is voided similar to the guarding reflex 8 9 In addition clozapine also abolished the high frequency oscillations in the bladder pressure and accompanying bursts in the external urethral sphincter EMG that are present during the expulsion phase of the micturition profile of the rat 7 In the clinical literature clozapine therapy is associated with a high incidence up to 44 in a recent study 10 of urinary incontinence and enuresis Olanzapine is a newer atypical antipsychotic agent with a pharmacological profile very similar to that of clozapine 11 In human brain tissue olanzapine displays very high affinity for the H1 histamine receptor high affinity for 5 HT2A and 5 HT2C receptors 12 In addition it also shows affinity for D2 muscarinic and alpha1 receptors with lower affinity for alpha2 5 HT1D and 5 HT1A receptors Table 1 12 Olanzapine therapy is associated with a number of side effects including somnolence agitation nervousness headaches dizziness weight gain constipation and dry mouth 5 Olanzapine however does not produce extrapyramidal side effects postural hypotension or hemotoxicity a particular problem for patients on clozapine therapy 13 Although urinary retention as a result of olanzapine therapy may be predicted from binding studies due to olanzapine s antimuscarinic activity 12 only 1 case report of micturition disturbance associated with olanzapine has recently appeared 14 On the other hand several reports of urinary disturbances due to clozapine can be found in the clinical literature 3 10 15 Risperidone another novel atypical neuroleptic shows very high affinity for 5HT 2A receptors with lower affinity for D2 receptors In terms of profile risperidone binds 5HT2A alpha1 H1 D2 alpha2 Table 1 12 16 Risperidone displays little or no affinity for the muscarinic receptor 11 12 16 and yet risperidone therapy has been associated with urinary incontinence 28 in some cases 17 18 19 We undertook this study to examine the effects of olanzapine and risperidone on the cystometrogram of anesthetized rats These two novel atypical neuroleptic compounds are used in clinical practice and it might be important to identify possible side effects that may have an impact on compliance to therapy or adversely affect the patient s quality of life e g persistent urinary incontinence Based on our previous findings with clozapine and given the similarity in pharmacological profiles between olanzapine and clozapine we hypothesized that olanzapine might also result in changes in urodynamic variables and or external urethral sphincter EMG Risperidone provides an interesting comparison to olanzapine since it has a similar pharmacological profile to olanzapine but without the antimuscarinic activity In this study olanzapine had greater effects than risperidone but both decreased micturition volume and increased residual volume in anesthetized rats In addition they inhibited the activity of the external urethral sphincter Olanzapine but not risperidone also had peripheral effects that reduced bladder contraction amplitude to electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve Results Effects of olanzapine and risperidone on single cystometry parameters Tables 2and 3 Olanzapine had no effect on bladder capacity Fig 3A and risperidone increased BC only at the highest dose 10 mg kg Fig 2I J 3A when the bladder capacity was 0 54 ml S E M 0 08 Table 3 compared to 0 35 ml 0 097 for vehicle injected control Micturition volume however was decreased by both olanzapine and risperidone The mean micturition volume in the olanzapine group after administration of vehicle was 0 2 ml 0 0 37 However after 0 1 and 1 0 mg kg the micturition volume dropped to 0 08 ml 0 014 and 0 04 ml 0 006 respectively Fig 3B Table 2 Similarly the risperidone group had a mean micturition volume of 0 27 ml 0 072 after vehicle injection but there was a significant decrease to 0 1 ml 0 019 and 0 12 ml 0 016 after 0 1 and 1 0 mg kg of risperidone Fig 3B Table 3 At 10 mg kg of risperidone the micturition volume was 0 19 ml 0 036 which was not statistically different from the control values Consequently the residual volume showed significant increases after 0 1 and 1 mg kg doses of olanzapine 76 5 3 and 89 2 4 respectively Fig 3C and after all doses of risperidone maximal effect at 0 1 mg kg 70 7 8 Fig 3C Olanzapine had no effect on pressure threshold however risperidone at 1 and 10 mg kg resulted in a significant increase in the pressure threshold 5 0 1 02 and 5 8 1 02 mm Hg respectively Fig 4A compared to the value observed during administration of vehicle 2 4 0 62 mm Hg The peak pressure during contraction was not changed by any of the doses of olanzapine tested in this study Fig 4B Interestingly 10 mg kg of risperidone showed a modest but statistically significant increase in peak contraction pressure 13 7 1 34 mm Hg compared to control value of 11 5 0 95 mm Hg Fig 4B The contraction time was not affected by either olanzapine or risperidone Fig 5A but the expulsion time the time during which the HFO occur was significantly decreased by both Fig 1 Fig 2 Fig 5B Olanzapine decreased the expulsion time from 2 6 0 55 sec after vehicle injection to 0 9 0 38 and 0 sec after 0 1 and 1 0 mg kg respectively Fig 5B The risperidone group had an expulsion time of 3 6 0 83 sec after control and it decreased to 1 5 0 34 and 1 4 0 35 sec after 0 1 and 1 mg kg of risperidone Fig 5B At 10 mg kg of risperidone the expulsion time was 2 2 0 46 sec Similarly olanzapine significantly decreased the amplitude of high frequency oscillations HFO from a control value of 1 6 0 19 to 1 0 0 38 mm Hg at 0 1 mg kg and abolished the HFO in all animals tested at 1 mg kg Fig 1 5C Risperidone also reduced the amplitude of the HFO from 1 6 0 19 to 1 0 0 22 0 9 0 18 and 1 1 0 22 mm Hg after 0 1 1 and 10 mg kg of risperidone Fig 2 5C Effects of olanzapine and risperidone on the external urethral sphincter Tables 2and 3 The EMG recorded from the urethral sphincter during bladder contractions also showed changes after risperidone or olanzapine Phase 1 of the EMG occurring during the initial rise in bladder pressure during a contraction was significantly decreased by olanzapine at 0 1 and 1 mg kg to 76 1 9 and 47 6 0 percent of the control value Fig 1F 1H 6A However risperidone had no significant effect on the EMG during phase 1 Fig 6A Phase 2 which corresponds to the occurrence of high frequency oscillations showed significant decreases in the integrated EMG following olanzapine or risperidone administration 0 1 mg kg of olanzapine significantly decreased the overall EMG during this phase to 42 11 4 of the control value and 1 0 mg kg of olanzapine abolished the bursting pattern of EMG Fig 1G 1H Fig 6B While risperidone also decreased the Phase 2 EMG the maximal decrease was 47 12 7 at 1 0 mg kg when compared to control Fig 6B and the bursting pattern was not abolished At 10 mg kg of risperidone the phase 2 EMG was 71 22 and was not significantly different from vehicle Phase 3 of the EMG during a bladder contraction also showed significant changes following olanzapine or risperidone Fig 6C Both drugs significantly decreased the amount of integrated EMG but 0 1 mg kg olanzapine had a more profound effect Fig 6C reducing the EMG to 35 5 2 of the control value at 1 0 mg kg compared to 68 8 0 of control after a similar dose of risperidone At 10 mg kg of risperidone the EMG was 73 9 0 of vehicle Finally while risperidone had no effect on the amplitude of the EMG bursts occurring the expulsion phase Fig 1 Fig 6D olanzapine abolished bursting of the EMG at 1 0 mg kg in all animals tested Fig 1H 6D Effects of olanzapine and risperidone on blood pressure Both olanzapine and risperidone decreased mean arterial pressure MAP in anesthetized rats Fig 7 Risperidone produced significant effects at all the doses tested with a maximum drop in MAP of approximately 46 mm Hg at 1 mg kg Mean 44 mm Hg SEM 1 37 Olanzapine showed a significant decrease in MAP at 1 0 mg kg with a maximum drop of approximately 26 mm Hg Mean 55 3 76 mm Hg In two animals where olanzapine was administered at 10 mg kg there was no further reduction in MAP Mean 57 4 95 mm Hg however significant respiratory depression was observed and therefore we excluded this dose for the remaining animals receiving olanzapine Effects of olanzapine and risperidone on bladder contractions elicited by electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve Prolonged electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve elicits a sustained bladder contraction with two components An initial rise in bladder pressure Phase I Fig 8A that is resistant to muscarinic blockade and a sustained part of the contraction Phase II or plateau phase that is very sensitive to anti muscarinic agents 20 21 Olanzapine at 1 and 10 mg kg reduced the amplitude of Phase I to 79 and 74 of the control values respectively Fig 8A B Risperidone on the other hand significantly increased the amplitude of phase I after 10 mg kg 116 of control The plateau phase or phase II of the pelvic nerve induced bladder contraction was significantly reduced by olanzapine Fig 8A 6C At 1 and 10 mg kg the response was 47 and 33 of the control values respectively Risperidone had no effect on Phase II amplitude Fig 8A 8C Discussion Effects of olanzapine and risperidone on urodynamic parameters and the external sphincter EMG Both olanzapine and risperidone are compounds with relatively high oral bioavailability Clinically effective doses of olanzapine 10 15 mg day 18 4 30 6 ng ml plasma concentration 22 23 24 or risperidone 3 6 mg day 15 30 8 ng ml combined plasma concentration of risperidone and 9 hydroxy risperidone 25 correspond well with the dose of 1 0 mg kg equivalent to 12 5 ng ml in the present study Both neuroleptics markedly decreased the micturition volume expulsion time and amplitude of the HFO while residual volume increased Most of the effects of either neuroleptic occurred at doses of 0 1 and 1 0 mg kg Olanzapine appeared to have a greater maximal effect than risperidone At the highest dose of risperidone 10 mg kg there was less of an effect for the urodynamic parameters mentioned above This is an interesting observation that was not explored further in the present study The physiological significance is unclear since the 10 mg kg dose is well above the clinically effective doses of risperidone Olanzapine did not have an effect on bladder capacity or pressure threshold while risperidone increased both although only at the highest doses Clozapine on the other hand was observed previously to increase bladder capacity and pressure threshold 6 7 Olanzapine had no effect on bladder peak pressure during contraction and only the highest dose of risperidone showed an increase in pressure 119 of control The increase in pressure after the highest dose of risperidone was interesting and was also observed following electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve suggesting a possible peripheral mechanism Olanzapine but not risperidone decreased the integrated EMG recorded during the beginning of a bladder contraction Phase 1 comparable to the guarding reflex Both neuroleptics decreased the EMG during phase 2 where high frequency oscillations occur in the bladder pressure along with bursting in the EUS with the highest dose of olanzapine 1 0 mg kg abolishing the HFO and the bursting pattern The integrated EMG recorded during the end of the bladder contraction Phase 3 was also decreased by both neuroleptics with olanzapine reducing it to 69 and 35 at 0 1 and 1 0 mg kg respectively whereas the maximal effect for risperidone was observed at 1 mg kg 68 Finally neither neuroleptic decreased the amplitude of the individual bursts of EMG recorded during phase 2 except for the largest dose of olanzapine 1 mg kg that abolished the bursting pattern Therefore as was the case for urodynamic parameters although both neuroleptics decreased the activity of the external urethral sphincter as reflected in the integrated EMG it appears that the effects of olanzapine were greater than those of risperidone As was the case for some urodynamic parameters the highest dose of risperidone showed a parabolic effect for some of the EMG parameters Blockade of the external urethral sphincter in anesthetized rats results in a disappearance of the HFO from the bladder pressure recording as well as a disappearance of the bursting pattern of the EUS EMG observed during HFO 26 27 28 In addition there is a decreased ability of the bladder to empty as evidenced by a decreased micturition volume and an increased residual volume 26 27 29 Therefore inhibition of the external urethral sphincter as was the case for the two neuroleptics in the present study and also for clozapine in our earlier study 7 might provide an important mechanism by which the bladder is rendered less effective in emptying and therefore altering other urodynamic variables resulting in decreased micturition volume and increased residual volume in rats Possible neuropharmacological mechanisms for the effect of olanzapine and risperidone on the lower urinary tract We tested for peripheral antimuscarinic actions of both neuroleptics by examining their effects on bladder contractions elicited by electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve In this preparation olanzapine but not risperidone reduced the initial contraction amplitude Phase I somewhat and markedly depressed the prolonged contraction phase Phase II Fig 8 that is thought to be mediated by muscarinic receptors 20 21 During cystometry however neither olanzapine nor risperidone affected the peak pressure during bladder contraction Therefore although olanzapine had a peripheral effect on bladder contraction amplitude as might be expected from its antimuscarinic effects this effect is not reflected in the peak contraction pressures observed during cystometry This discrepancy is probably due to the fact that during a bladder contraction against a closed outlet electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve higher pressures were developed than were observed during cystometry when the outlet was not obstructed Since the clinically effective dose of olanzapine 10 15 mg day 18 4 30 6 ng ml plasma concentration 22 23 24 is greater than the first dose observed to produce significant peripheral antimuscarinic effects in this study 1 0 mg kg equivalent to 12 5 ng ml plasma concentration a possible peripheral anti muscarinic on the bladder during olanzapine therapy remains a concern Muscarinic blockade with atropine decreased micturition pressure and micturition volume while increasing residual volume 30 and bladder capacity 31 Similarly central administration of atropine decreased peak pressure and voiding efficiency while increasing bladder capacity in awake rats 32 Thus it is possible that central and or peripheral muscarinic blockade by olanzapine may have contributed to some of the changes observed in these parameters in the present study Muscarinic blockade was also reported to decrease the EUS EMG in all phases of the bladder contraction 33 However another study showed no effect on the EUS EMG following muscarinic antagonism 34 Therefore the exact role of muscarinic blockade on the activity of the EUS in the rat is unclear It is tempting to propose that the greater effect of olanzapine on the EUS may be due to its antimuscarinic activity which risperidone does not have In fact clozapine has a greater affinity for muscarinic receptors than olanzapine 11 and clozapine was also able to decrease the EMG and abolish the bursting pattern during phase 2 Whether muscarinic blockade affects the activity of the EUS by acting on central or peripheral sites remains to be determined A direct inhibitory action of olanzapine on the EUS muscle itself is not expected and was not seen with clozapine 7 However antimuscarinic effects alone cannot account for all of the effects of olanzapine on the EUS since risperidone had a similar effect although not quite as pronounced and risperidone has little or no affinity for muscarinic receptors 16 Therefore antagonism of other transmitter systems e g D2 alpha1 5 HT2 remains as an explanation of the effects of these neuroleptics on urodynamic variables 6 Selective antagonism of D2 receptors only modestly reduced the amplitude of HFO without affecting any other urodynamic parameters 6 35 Therefore it is possible that olanzapine and risperidone decrease the amplitude of the HFO at least partly through antagonism of D2 receptors In anesthetized rats doxazosin alpha 1 adrenergic receptor antagonist administered systemically increased micturition volume bladder capacity residual volume and micturition frequency while decreasing peak pressure 36 Only an increase in the micturition frequency was observed after spinal administration of doxazosin 37 Both olanzapine and risperidone have moderate affinity for the alpha 1 adrenergic receptor Table 1 therefore it is possible that some of the effects observed in the present study were due to central and or peripheral antagonism of alpha 1 adrenergic receptors by these drugs The decreases observed in MAP suggest a possible peripheral alpha1 effect However we did not observe a decrease in the peak pressure as would have been predicted from previous studies using selective alpha 1 antagonism 36 In addition bladder capacity was not affected except at the highest dose of risperidone tested Urinary incontinence as a result of olanzapine 12 or clozapine 15 therapy was treated effectively with ephedrine alpha adrenergic receptor agonist suggesting a possible alpha1 effect However alpha1a adrenoceptor gene polymorphism was found to play no role in clozapine induced urinary incontinence 38 In terms of the effects on the EUS alpha 1 antagonists have been shown to inhibit the EUS in the cat 39 40 41 but not in the anesthetized rat 42 Finally both olanzapine and risperidone posses affinities to several serotonin receptor subtypes Table 1 In cats serotonin antagonists caused a decrease in bladder capacity 43 however in anesthetized rats serotonin antagonism did not have an effect on micturition 44 Recently a selective 5 HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100635 was reported to inhibit bladder contractions in rats 45 yet another report only observed an increase in the pressure threshold 46 Olanzapine and risperidone have only low to modest affinity for the 5 HT1A receptor and higher affinities for the 5 HT2A and 5 HT2C receptors 11 12 Serotonin 5 HT2 and 5 HT3 receptors facilitate pudendal reflexes in the cat 47 48 therefore it is possible that antagonism of these receptors may block the EUS in the anesthetized rat Given the modest role of serotonin receptors in micturition in anesthetized rats it remains to be determined whether the effects observed here were due to anti serotonergic effects of these neuroleptics Clinical implications While there are several reports of urinary disturbances following clozapine therapy 3 10 15 there are relatively few reports of urinary incontinence with risperidone or olanzapine In one report twenty eight 28 of patients on risperidone developed at least transient urinary incontinence compared to 13 before starting treatment 18 Other reports also suggest urinary incontinence associated with risperidone therapy 17 19 To date only one case report of urinary incontinence with olanzapine therapy that resolved with ephredrine was found in the literature 14 In the present study olanzapine had more profound effects on urodynamic parameters and the EUS than risperidone and therefore the incidence of urinary disturbances in clinical practice would be predicted to be higher Olanzapine is a newer compound than clozapine or risperidone and therefore a larger incidence of urinary symptoms with olanzapine therapy may await a larger sampling Finally possible side effects of neuroleptics such as urinary retention may be predicted from binding studies using human brain tissue 12 if antimuscarinic affinities will correspond to antimuscarinic effects on the bladder However olanzapine and risperidone may also result in urinary disturbances by their influence on central pathways mediating bladder contractions or coordinating external urethral sphincter as may have been the case in the present study Such effects may not be readily apparent or predictable from receptor binding studies Conclusions Olanzapine and to a lesser extent risperidone altered several micturition parameters and they inhibited the external urethral sphincter in the anesthetized rat These effects resulted in a decreased effectiveness of the bladder to empty as evidenced by a decreased micturition volume and an increase in the residual volume and a decreased activity of the external urethral sphincter Although olanzapine also showed peripheral anti muscarinic effects on bladder contractions risperidone did not Therefore peripheral anti muscarinic effects alone cannot explain all the changes observed with these drugs and they might reflect central effects on micturition pathways Materials and Methods Urodynamic Studies The bladder was emptied and allowed to equilibrate to air pressure for 5 minutes before beginning each cystometrogram Room temperature saline was infused into the bladder 0 11 ml min while recording bladder pressure and the infusion was stopped when a contraction occurred Volume expelled was determined by placing cotton gauze at the urinary meatus and weighing before and after micturition External urethral sphincter EMG EUS EMG was recorded throughout the cystometrogram and for sometime after the filling had stopped Cumulative doses of olanzapine provided as a courtesy by Ely Lilly Indianapolis vehicle 0 01 0 1 1 mg kg n 5 and risperidone RBI vehicle 0 01 0 1 1 10 mg kg n 7 were administered i v at approximately 10 minute intervals The plasma half life of olanzapine and risperidone are 2 5 and 15 hr respectively 25 49 Both drugs were dissolved in a minimal amount of 0 1 N HCl and brought up to volume with saline final pH 6 Cystometrograms were started approximately 3 minutes after each drug administration Bladder contractions induced by pelvic nerve stimulation In order to determine the direct peripheral effects of these drugs on the bladder the distal end of a pelvic nerve was stimulated electrically to elicit a bladder contraction n 8 Both hypogastric and pelvic nerves were cut before they entered the major pelvic ganglion and a tie was placed around the urinary meatus to preserve isovolumetric conditions After infusing 0 1 0 2 ml into the bladder the distal cut end of the pelvic nerve was stimulated with a long train 5 Hz 1 msec pulse width 60 sec train 30 300 uamps to elicit a prolonged contraction displaying two phases Phase I a rapid contraction and Phase II a plateau phase 20 21 Phase I is resistant to atropine and therefore is mostly due to non adrenergic non cholinergic activation whereas Phase II is highly sensitive to muscarinic blockade 21 Olanzapine n 4 and risperidone n 4 were administered 0 01 0 1 1 and 10 mg kg i v and the stimulations were repeated at 10 minutes intervals At the end of each experiment all rats were overdosed with urethane i v Data analysis Bladder pressure and EUS EMG during the cystometrograms were displayed in an electronic chart recorder RC Electronics Goleta CA and analyzed off line Dataview W J Heitler U St Andrews Scotland The following

time between peak pressure and end of high frequency oscillations amplitude of high frequency oscillations The EMG activity was examined by dividing the bladder contraction into three phases in a

under curve of the EMG corresponding to each phase of the bladder contraction was measured Sigma Scan Image Jandel Scientifics San Rafael Ca Drug effects were calculated as percent of control In the
