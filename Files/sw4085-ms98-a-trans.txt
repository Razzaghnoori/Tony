                hi Ed   hello Carolyn   do you uh work for a large organization   yes i work for North Carolina State University which has about six or seven thousand employees   wow what do you do are you   im an associate professor in electrical and computer engineering and computer science   i see   and you work for TI   yes   and you do   im a computer scientist   umhum   and always concerned about benefits   right well i im on the benefits committee here one of about twenty people in the university so thats why i checked that topic   oh you are i see uh what do you think peoples concern is about benefits is it mostly in the area of health care   i swear thats what i was going to say we seem to get more more uh complaints about that than about anything else although you get a good deal of complaints over other kinds of insurance too um   yeah health care we have we are on the state health system which is my understanding is that it is a lot worse than the system we had when we had our own just for the university and i wouldnt be real surprised if thats the case um   uh yeah they people are uh complaining because the rates for families uh what you know the the uh   uh the additional amount you have to pay to cover a family has gone up quite rapidly   oh yeah yeah well weve our benefits have changed recently to where we have network doctors and network hospitals kind of uh a preferred provider   uhhuh   and the  you wouldnt believe the complaints   huh   because  you know youre family doctor may not happen to be in the network   right   and uh so there uh you your benefits are reduced if you dont go to a network doctor   well do you yeah but i mean do people get to choose whether to take the the preferred preferred provider or not   thats right thats right you get to choose whether or not you want to change doctors   huh right but so so so people would stay in an existing plan that that didnt require you to go to a preferred provider in that case right   no no the the plan allows you to do either one the benefits that are paid are considerably better when uh   with the preferred provider   we are with the preferred provider yes   huh wonder about the economics of that uh the uh you know twenty years ago when HMOs just got started uh when they started enrolling a lot of people uh it was felt that this would be the way to control health care costs and it worked to some degree but it didnt work that much and the reason was adverse selection the people that go into HMOs are are those that have uh you know that that have generally lesser health needs and i mean its obvious why that is because the people that that that are already sick are going to see a particular doctor and they dont want to switch just to come in the HMO so you get the people in the H O they they dont uh you know require that much uh care at all and then some how you got less people paying premiums into the into the uh insurance system than you have uh uh you you have almost as many claims so uh thats thats caused a problem uh   have you heard about uh cafeteria the cafeteria plan of benefits   yes uh i dont think we have a very good cafeteria being a university industry tends to have a lot better programs     well i dont know i i would id be interested in seeing in learning more about that because   uhhuh   uh i have no children so i am not interested really in child care benefits except i suppose as a citizen of the world or something   uhhuh right well i i dont know i mean the questions is should should it be the employer that pays for child care uh if if there were a tax credit then everybody would get it regardless who they worked for and you you would also be better in the sense that that people who had only one income in the family would get as much as people who had two and you would sort of think that the people who have one income kind of need it more   yeah yeah i just i i like the concept of being able to choose which benefits are more important to you   so oh yes no that that that its true thats thats important i agree uh yeah thats true and child care is one of the big ones that that gets thrown in um   well you know if you were married to a doctor then you might not need so much   medical care   medical insurance or something i dont know   i dont know about that       youd have youd youd have your office visits covered but thats only a small part of the total   yeah im sure but   yeah   uh on the other hand you know maybe maybe if you had false teeth you wouldnt care about dental insurance   uh well i think you probably would need more denture work wouldnt you now i dont care too much about dental work because of of their dental the dental insurance because i rarely well almost never for the last eight years have i used up enough to   would you i dont know   uh you know paid enough in in dental bills to uh come up to even the smallest amount you can set aside monthly uh but not everybody is like that and people who have kids that need uh you know an orthodontist services certainly would not be in that situation   yeah thats right but that you know people like
