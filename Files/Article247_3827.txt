 Sleeping Your Way to the White House Dear Ted Looks like it s time to clear the dishes from this old breakfast table I ll endure the scurrying roaches long enough to say It s been a lot of fun although I don t usually have elephant dung with my oatmeal I should have known I d get myself in trouble by calling names of my favorite editorial illustrators I left out Burt Silverman Joe Ciardiello Alan Cober and Julian Allen the last two alas having passed last year And Ralph Steadman the King of Swing About drawing ability don t sweat it Ted Your work is so much better drawn than Lurie s that the subject shouldn t even be on the table You have what all great artists of all disciplines need self knowledge It is the understanding of our own artistic personalities temperaments and yes limitations that enables us to shape an effective statement on the page While a burnt out hack like Lurie sweats bullets trying to be Levine and failing every single solitary day of his long and lucrative life excellent cartoonists figure out how to draw in a way that perfectly supports the statement they re making You mention Thurber How sublime he is Those drawings bring you right in Somehow and I don t know how they cause you to stop flipping and really look and then of course you re reading the story The Tom Tomorrow thing is interesting He d be out on his keister without a Xerox machine But who cares The image matches the voice wonderfully And the voice is saying important things Your work understands how fast we re flipping through the newspaper It brings us immediately to the idea Your understanding of blacks is very keen those lines hold the image and grab our attention So your cranky left of irony point of view comes in loud and clear For God s sake don t learn to draw For years I resisted The Simpsons I hated the drawings It seemed a cheap approach to animation Plus it was on the Fox Network so I thought how could this be worth the trouble to sit and watch it TV is a big effort for me Turns out of course it s perhaps TV s greatest moment All the crappy drawing and family situation comedy is a ruse It gets the masses in the tent and then Groening lets them have it It s powerful experimental strangely committed On top of that there s very real and touching character development It is a work of unalloyed genius More than the work of my favorite graphic artists this program will be the thing our cultural era will be remembered for because he wrapped his message in such strategic cleverness as to make it a Saturn rocket that blasts into every home in the USA And the guy can t draw to save himself I ll finish with Phil Harris I know you ve been waiting Phil Harris was Jack Benny s orchestra leader on radio He was also married to Alice Faye the gorgeous star of many 20 th Century Fox musicals Benny in an interview said that the writers always wrote Harris radio character as if he d just got out of bed having had great sex Harris on radio is laid back flippant casual with a little buzz on You could just see the cigarette Everyone knows a guy like this someone so comfortable with himself that he just doesn t give a f k And this it occurs to me is why Al Gore is a loser George W Bush you just know has great sex He said to me last year Maybe I ll see you in national politics maybe I won t I have a cool life Bill Bradley C mon great sex He s a jock could get all the girls he wanted He s traveled everywhere knows about life Every movement is easy He s comfortable with himself Al Gore looks like a guy who broke his toe because the vibrator fell out of the medicine cabinet when he opened it looking for a band aid because he cut his finger trying to undo his wife s bra People don t think these things of course But I think they perceive them subconsciously If a man is comfortable with himself he ll be comfortable in the job It s too bad though Stevenson might have made an inspired president Or Mondale Or Dukakis Or Gore But I don t think we ll get to find out Au revoir Steve
