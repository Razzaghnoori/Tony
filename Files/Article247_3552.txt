 Land of the Freeh Home of the Blaze Issue 1 is the long suppressed video evidence of federal pyrotechnic use at Waco Issue 2 is the ethics of the Clintons including the financing of their mortgage and their public disagreement over clemency for Puerto Rican criminals Issue 3 is Pat Buchanan s flirtation with the Reform Party The pundits all agree that the Waco investigation has been mishandled but they disagree over who mishandled it Liberal pundits like Mark Shields and Al Hunt both of CNN s Capitol Gang tend to blame FBI Director Louis Freeh charging that he was closest to the suppressed evidence Conservatives such as Capitol Gang s Kate O Beirne and Bob Novak blame Reno noting that Freeh took office several months after Waco Interestingly the politicians mirror this partisan divide President Clinton has publicly supported Reno but not Freeh and on CNN s Late Edition Rep John Conyers D Mich does the same But on CBS s Face the Nation Clinton hating Rep Dan Burton R Ind supports Freeh and on Late Edition Republicans Sen Orrin Hatch of Utah and former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh also back Freeh a Clinton appointee Thornburgh casts Freeh as a fall guy and Hatch calls him the single best FBI director I ve seen But just how important is Waco Answers range from in fact there isn t any evidence that the feds started the fire Brit Hume Fox News Sunday to we re talking about an event unparalleled in American history Mark Shields PBS s Newshour With Jim Lehrer Shields compares the impact of Waco on the American psyche to that of the Kennedy assassination Despite this disagreement everyone seconds Reno s call for an independent investigation and they marvel at Reno s aura of political independence Fox panelists Mara Liasson and Juan Williams speculate that her Abe Lincoln status derives from her refusal to participate in the Washington social scene To read Slate s take on Reno s independent image click here To learn more about Waco pyrotechnics click here The commentariat splits over the propriety of Democratic fund raiser Terry McAuliffe s million dollar underwriting of the Clintons mortgage Mara Liasson Sam Donaldson ABC s This Week and George F Will This Week think it doesn t matter Clinton is a lame duck and it s not really a gift But Juan Williams Brit Hume Cokie Roberts This Week and Bill Kristol This Week think it does matter giving a million dollars in collateral to a politician even for private use amounts to improper influence The opinion mafia guffaws over Hillary s belated opposition to her husband s proposed clemency for 16 Puerto Rican terrorists Almost no one believes Hillary s assertion that she and Bill never discussed the pardon offer Several pundits speculate that the president might pardon Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard to appease Jewish interests in New York Many pundits including Paul Gigot Newshour and every Capitol Gang panelist predict that presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan will bolt the GOP for the Reform Party Buchanan and Ross Perot are both economic populists Gigot explains and by nominating Buchanan Perot can wrest control of the party from Minnesota Gov Jesse Ventura who opposes Buchanan s nomination Shields points out that Perot dislikes the Bush family for its alleged dirty tricks in the 92 presidential campaign Several pundits caution that Buchanan won t jump ship unless Perot can virtually guarantee him the nomination and that Buchanan may lose his pro life followers if he joins the Reform Party which eschews social issues Conservative pundits note with glee that many of the same GOP leaders who refused Buchanan the podium at the 96 Republican Convention are now begging him to stay in the party Portrait of a Humanitarian Still on vacation John McLaughlin runs another prerecorded show this time on immigration He tries to peg the topic to Labor Day Unlike last week s entertaining but airy show on the millennium this week s smart program is grounded in specific policy issues like temporary work visas mail order brides and bilingual education But what s remarkable about the show is not the topic it s panelist Dan Stein spokesman for the closed borders group FAIR who comes off as singularly obnoxious no mean feat on McLaughlin Immigration he warns us brings about the Brazilianization of America When a panelist remarks that many immigrants are valedictorians Stein sneers You and I should visit some federal prisons together When Eleanor Clift talks about the Latin immigrants in her childhood neighborhood in Queens Stein interjects Why don t you move there if you like it so much Stein also informs us that when Alan Greenspan trumpets immigrant labor as an inflation weapon what he s really saying is We re redistributing income to the employers and the immigrants themselves take ing it out of the pocket of middle class taxpayers to pay for the benefit of the army of marching poor that we re importing into the country In truth Stein s politics aren t that unreasonable But one has to think that even the Know Nothings had more class Last Word Defending America s pro Yeltsin Russia policy on Fox Sen Joseph Biden D Del says We ve been dealing with Yeltsin because he s the guy in power The other guys behind him are no box of chocolates You know everyone thinks there s a Jeffersonian Democrat waiting to pop up Democratic reform is going to take a generation The question is How do we cut the losses and how do we keep a process going where we continue to destroy nuclear weapons
