 The First Amendment Works in Cyberspace Too Having read Larry s valedictory I am impressed more with his plaintive rhetorical ploys than his substantive argument It is not that he is a failed teacher who cannot convey the sound message to a slow student It is that he is a skilled teacher or at least advocate who has tried to sell an alarmist message that just does not add up The first problem that I see is that Larry cannot distinguish between a change and a problem Of course the proprietary systems will loom larger on the Internet with the rise of commerce But that makes sense for most people If the system turns out to be filled with folks who plant traps along the way there are responses to deal with them whether they are the next generation of cookies or the old bait and switch techniques We have rules that regulate the full time surveillance of other individuals on land and these can be carried over to the Net as needed And should we worry if the ACLU and the Christian right have their gates to filter information Yes if they can impose their will on individuals who do not join in their cause but no if the service is requested and disclosed in advance But whether it is done online or in person it does not count as censorship or at least censorship worthy of scorn if requested by the individual in question Larry seems to think that public and private controls are the same but they are not at least when the private areas give choices and allow for new entry The second problem that I see with Larry s approach is that he assumes that there is some selective legal void in cyberspace Take one of his examples If I give my information to Site 1 and then it is transfered without my consent to an affiliated site that could well amount to a breach of duty that exposes the operators of both sites to serious liabilities Just think of the roar that went up when it was found out that some public radio stations gave their lists out only to Democrats for recruitment purposes We could protest with the same intensity for illicit sharing that takes place over the Net Larry thinks that the old Net had this virtue that it embedded architecturally a First Amendment He laments that the new one does not But it is not as though once we shift to a partly restricted Net that First Amendment claims cannot be brought against governments that seek to regulate the Net in ways they could not regulate other media So here Larry tells us that it becomes possible for local governments to begin to impose regulation on people on the Net by forcing local servers to condition access based on the features of who people are But the painfully obvious answer is not if that kind of restriction violates the First Amendment The state could not condition the power of a newspaper to sell its paper on the willingness to sell its subscriber list so why here Let s be clear about one thing My position is not that government can do no wrong on the Net or that private firms can do no right My view is that the standard set of legal techniques from contract to legislation to constitutional protection carry over well to this new environment even after it ceases to be organized as vast public space as it was at its outset Markets survive only if individuals value what they get for more than it costs They require government protection of property rights to work well But governments can abuse their powers and should be subject to constitutional checks All agreed But nothing about the Internet no special brand of cyberspace liberty changes these fundamental relationships and the problems they pose The reason it is so difficult to come to grips with what Larry says is that his threats are diffuse and often hypothetical His down to earth analogies are more instructive and less alarmist because they do not ignore the sensible constitutional political and market counterstrategies that are available Of course there will be problems on the Net just as there will be problems in any space to which any of have to venture No one should be Pangloss or Cassandra Au revoir
