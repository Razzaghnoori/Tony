                                 The First Amendment Works in Cyberspace Too                        Having read Larrys valedictory I amimpressed more with his plaintive rhetorical ploys than his substantiveargument It is not that he is a failed teacher who cannot convey the soundmessage to a slow student It is that he is a skilled teacher or at leastadvocate who has tried to sell an alarmist message that just does not addup            The first problem that I see is that Larry cannot distinguish between achange and a problem Of course the proprietary systems will loom larger on theInternet with the rise of commerce But that makes sense for most people Ifthe system turns out to be filled with folks who plant traps along the waythere are responses to deal with them whether they are the next generation ofcookies or the old baitandswitch techniques We have rules that regulate thefulltime surveillance of other individuals on land and these can be carriedover to the Net as needed And should we worry if the ACLU and the Christianright have their gates to filter information Yes if they can impose theirwill on individuals who do not join in their cause but no if the service isrequested and disclosed in advance But whether it is done online or in personit does not count as censorship or at least censorship worthy of scorn ifrequested by the individual in question Larry seems to think that public andprivate controls are the same but they are not at least when the privateareas give choices and allow for new entry            The second problem that I see with Larrys approach is that he assumes thatthere is some selective legal void in cyberspace Take one of his examples IfI give my information to Site  and then it is transfered without my consentto an affiliated site that could well amount to a breach of duty that exposesthe operators of both sites to serious liabilities Just think of the roar thatwent up when it was found out that some public radio stations gave their listsout only to Democrats for recruitment purposes We could protest with the sameintensity for illicit sharing that takes place over the Net            Larry thinks that the old Net had this virtue that it embeddedarchitecturally a First Amendment He laments that the new one does not Butit is not as though once we shift to a partly restricted Net that FirstAmendment claims cannot be brought against governments that seek to regulatethe Net in ways they could not regulate other media So here Larry tells usthat it becomes possible for local governments to begin to impose regulationon people on the Net by forcing local servers to condition access based on thefeatures of who people are But the painfully obvious answer is not if thatkind of restriction violates the First Amendment The state could not conditionthe power of a newspaper to sell its paper on the willingness to sell itssubscriber list so why here            Lets be clear about one thing My position is not that government can do nowrong on the Net or that private firms can do no right My view is that thestandard set of legal techniques from contract to legislation toconstitutional protection carry over well to this new environment even afterit ceases to be organized as vast public space as it was at its outsetMarkets survive only if individuals value what they get for more than it costsThey require government protection of property rights to work well Butgovernments can abuse their powers and should be subject to constitutionalchecks All agreed But nothing about the Internet no special brand ofcyberspace liberty changes these fundamental relationships and the problemsthey pose The reason it is so difficult to come to grips with what Larry saysis that his threats are diffuse and often hypothetical His downtoearthanalogies are more instructive and less alarmist because they do not ignorethe sensible constitutional political and market counterstrategies that areavailable Of course there will be problems on the Net just as there will beproblems in any space to which any of have to venture No one should bePangloss or Cassandra Au revoir
