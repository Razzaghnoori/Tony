 Unhappy Birthday The bombed shell of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic s Belgrade residence was the favorite front page picture in the European press Friday Yesterday the war got personal commented the Daily Telegraph of London Slobba s Cracking said the British tabloid the Sun claiming that Milosevic made a new peace offer only because NATO had blown his bed to bits The main story in both the Telegraph and the Times of London was the new hawkishness of British Prime Minister Tony Blair His statements in the United States that victory was the only acceptable exit strategy from Yugoslavia are part of a new Anglo American deal the Telegraph claimed Blair and President Clinton have forged a new strategic partnership in which Mr Blair is the leading hawk and Mr Clinton tacitly goes along with deeper involvement in the Balkans While Mr Blair tried to stiffen spines among the other 17 Nato leaders arriving for the Alliance s 50 th birthday Mr Clinton made it clear that the world s sole superpower was underwriting the British led escalation The Times front page headline was Hawk Blair stiffens US resolve It compared his behavior in the United States with Margaret Thatcher s spine stiffening American visit before the Gulf War The liberal Guardian highlighted Blair s call for a new doctrine of international community and his explicit statement in a speech in Chicago that his Third Way thinking offers a framework for the entire globe But the paper led on Milosevic s peace offer which it said included a key Yugoslav concession agreement to an international security force in Kosovo In an op ed article Thursday Times columnist Anatole Kaletsky attributed the triumph of the Third Way to the global economic crisis of the past two years This he said is one of the luckiest breaks that Bill Clinton and Tony Blair ever had even in their amazingly lucky careers Kaletsky wrote Nobody seems to believe any longer that markets work best if businesses are simply left to their own devices or that capitalism can avoid booms and busts without active government intervention In short the Third Way faith in smart government seems to have triumphed completely over the Thatcher Reagan doctrine that government is the problem and market forces the solution In an analysis of Blair s new internationalism on its editorial page Le Monde of Paris described it Friday as a kind of humanitarian Wilsonism that wouldn t be limited to the right of peoples to self determination that Woodrow Wilson wanted to impose on the defeated European empires after World War I it defends the rights of man the rights of minorities and cultural and religious freedoms The author welcomed Europe s attempt in Kosovo to break openly with the spirit of Munich but warned that the new internationalism contains paradoxes that could spell trouble in the future One is its willingness to use NATO rather than the United Nations to enforce the aims of the U N Charter another was uncertainty about its geographical extension should its writ run outside Europe another the tendency of American messianism to mask egotistic nationalist policies and yet another the clash of different national values and principles around the world In Germany the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung led on peace moves under the headline Bonn expects much from American Russian co operation While highlighting Chancellor Gerhard Schr der s three conditions for peace an immediate end to the use of force a withdrawal of Serb military paramilitary and police personnel from Kosovo and their replacement by international peace enforcers it said in an editorial that NATO can only leave Yugoslavia as victors The main Italian papers all led Friday on Milosevic agreeing to a U N presence in Kosovo while El Mundo of Madrid led with Clinton authorizing preparations for a land invasion In a report from New York La Repubblica of Rome said it is now clear that the NATO allies are divided into doves and hawks with Germany and Italy being the leading doves and Britain the leading hawk Corriere della Sera of Milan carried a front page report that the southeast Italian region of Apulia has experienced a 40 percent fall in summer tourist bookings because of the Kosovo conflict and has appealed to the Italian government to declare it an economic crisis zone According to the Daily Telegraph an interview in the Washington Post with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana revealing a dusting down of Kosovo invasion plans was arranged by the White House In an article on NATO s birthday celebrations the Times Brussels correspondent recalled how one week into NATO s air campaign Solana told visitors not to worry about Kosovo spoiling the party I m sure the problem will be solved before April 23 he said then with a reassuring smile Among several British editorials on NATO s birthday the Times warned Blair against trying to woo America with the moral fervour which comes so naturally to him since what was most needed to sway U S opinion was an informed case based on strategic interest an argument for committing US troops that explains why the future contours of European peace are being decided in the Balkans It warned him too not to jump the gun on Clinton and to avoid the slightest hint that this is a Bill and Tony show with the rest of Europe hanging on their coat tails The paper said US troops in Kosovo are vital because the key is the decisive thwarting of Slobodan Milosevic s campaign as destabilising as it is criminal against its people The Guardian under the headline Unhappy Birthday said the celebrations were taking place in the wrong place at the wrong time because the war will need to be over won is hardly apt before the profoundest question of this anniversary season can be addressed whether the North Atlantic Alliance can and should continue into the 21 st century The Daily Telegraph however extolled NATO as the only organisation capable of upholding the international order and defended its Yugoslavia offensive as a means of keeping the United States happy America with its Wilsonian moral impulses could not be held indefinitely in an alliance that sat back fat and happy while atrocities were being committed on a large scale in Europe s backyard it said Disgust with European complacency would have led to fresh calls for withdrawal In the Arab and Islamic world newspaper commentators were urging an Islamic contribution to solving the Kosovo crisis In al Ra i of Jordan Thursday political analyst Fahd al Fanek said Islamic countries should put together a peacekeeping force that would be acceptable to both the Serbs and the Kosovar Albanians while Clovis Maksoud writing in both al Khaleej of the United Arab Emirates and the Pan Arab al Hayat said Arabs should work to take the initiative out of NATO s hands and restore it to the United Nations where it belongs Maksoud a former Arab League diplomat now heading the Center for the Global South at the American University in Washington noted a frightening and obscene convergence between Serbia s ethnic cleansing and the behavior of NATO which has taken international law into its own hands
