 Background The enzymatic cleavage of double stranded ds RNA structures is an essential step in the maturation and decay of many eukaryotic and prokaryotic RNAs Members of the ribonuclease III superfamily of endoribonucleases 1 are the primary agents of dsRNA cleavage 2 RNase III orthologues are conserved in eukaryotes and in bacteria with Escherichia coli RNase III 3 as the best characterized member E coli RNase III is active as a homodimer and requires a divalent metal ion preferably Mg 2 to hydrolyze phosphodiesters creating 5 phosphate 3 hydroxyl product termini 4 E coli RNase III cleaves rRNA and mRNA precursors as part of the respective maturation pathways E coli RNase III also initiates mRNA degradation and participates in antisense RNA action 2 5 6 7 8 Bacterial RNase III orthologues exhibit the simplest primary structure which includes a C terminal dsRNA binding motif dsRBM and an N terminal catalytic nuclease domain Figure 1 The dsRBM is present in many other proteins that bind dsRNA 9 10 and is important for RNase III activity in in vitro 11 The catalytic domain contains a number of conserved residues including an 11 amino acid signature motif that is a distinguishing feature of RNase III orthologues The isolated E coli RNase III catalytic domain which retains homodimeric behavior can cleave dsRNA substrates under specific conditions in vitro 11 The recently reported crystal structure of the catalytic domain of Aquifex aeolicus RNase III reveals an extensive subunit interface with the cleft between the subunits predicted to bind dsRNA 12 The two proposed active sites are positioned at each end of the intersubunit cleft and contain conserved residues from each subunit Several highly conserved carboxylic acids in the active sites bind a single divalent metal ion 12 and one of these residues has been shown to be essential for catalytic activity of E coli RNase III 13 Two mammalian RNase III orthologues have been identified and exhibit common domains as well as apparently unique features The RNase III orthologue Dicer Figure 1 plays a central role in RNA interference RNAi by cleaving dsRNAs to 21 bp fragments termed small interfering si RNAs The siRNAs are incorporated into a macromolecular complex which carries out degradation of homologous RNA sequences 14 Dicer action serves to inhibit viral infection and retroposon movement and also plays a role in developmental pathways by cleaving precursors to small regulatory RNAs reviewed in 14 15 The predicted sequence of the mouse Dicer polypeptide exhibits a single dsRBM and tandem catalytic domains In addition the N terminal region contains a DExH DEAH RNA helicase motif and a PAZ Pinwheel Argonaut Zwille domain which is also present in other proteins involved in RNAi 16 17 The second mammalian RNase III orthologue also exhibits a single C terminal dsRBM and tandem catalytic domains but is otherwise structurally distinct from Dicer as it lacks the helicase and PAZ domains Figure 1 18 19 Preliminary evidence indicates that this RNase III orthologue participates in rRNA maturation Thus a reduction in human RNase III levels in vivo causes the accumulation of specific rRNA processing intermediates 18 Consistent with this functional role human RNase III localizes to the nucleolus in a cell cycle dependent manner 18 A truncated form of human RNase III has been purified and shown to cleave dsRNA in vitro 18 However little else is known of the functional roles or the mechanistic features of this enzyme We report here i the characteristics of the cDNA sequence and predicted polypeptide of mouse RNase III ii demonstrate transcript expression patterns and iii report the chromosomal locations of the mouse and human RNase III genes Results and Discussion Features of the mouse RNase III cDNA sequence The mouse RNase III cDNA structure was determined by sequence analysis of individual cDNA clones see Materials and Methods whose sequences relative to the full length sequence are shown in Figure 2 The length of the mouse RNase III cDNA is 4487 nt see Additional File 1 and the predicted initiation codon is at position 243 This prediction is based on the occurrence of three in frame stop codons upstream of the indicated ATG within the 242 nt 5 untranslated region 5 UTR see Additional File 1 It is not firmly established if the reported 5 end nucleotide corresponds to the true 5 end of the mRNA However several independent partial cDNA clones see Figure 2 contain the same 5 nucleotide There is no significant sequence similarity of the mouse 5 UTR with that of human RNase III 245 nt The 3 UTR is 123 nt in size and contains a consensus polyadenylation signal AAUAAA 12 nucleotides from the poly A tail The 3 UTR exhibits 87 identity with the human 3 UTR 372 nt over a 76 nt region corresponding to positions 37 113 of the mouse 3 UTR and positions 39 115 of the human 3 UTR A search of the NCBI mouse EST database yielded five independent clones which exhibit 100 percent sequence identity with the 3 UTR data not shown The predicted 3 UTR of the mouse RNase III mRNA and that of the rat RNase III mRNA share 85 nucleotide identity and have the same lengths data not shown Additional File 1 Mouse RNase III cDNA and amino acid sequences The proposed translational initiation codon and the polyadenylation signal are underlined The three in frame stop codons upstream of the initiation codon are italicized Nucleotide and amino acid positions are provided on the right The human RNase III amino acid sequence is also shown in italics The shaded amino acids indicate residues in the Proline rich region the RS domain and the catalytic domain signature sequences Three potential nuclear localization signals beginning at positions 254 355 and 508 are underlined Click here for file Features of the predicted RNase III polypeptide The dsRBM and catalytic domains Conceptual translation of the mouse RNase III cDNA using the AUG at position 243 as the initiation codon yields a polypeptide of 1373 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 158 8 kDa and a pI of 7 99 The polypeptide contains a single dsRBM and two RNase III catalytic domain elements see Additional File 1 The RNase III domain i e the two catalytic domains and dsRBM of the mouse and human sequences exhibit 99 amino acid identity and 88 nucleotide sequence identity Figure 3provides an alignment of the RNase III domains of the mouse human Drosophila and C elegans RNase III orthologues The latter two sequences also exhibit strong conservation of sequence over the entire length of the region Note also that Drosophila RNase III has a serine rich C terminal extension 19 There are two catalytic domain signature sequences present in these orthologues The single signature sequence of bacterial RNase III orthologues not only provides residues essential for catalysis but contributes to the subunit interface 12 It is therefore likely that mouse RNase III is active as a homodimer If so the holoenzyme may contain four active sites The Proline rich region A proline rich region PRR is present in the N terminal portion of the polypeptide see Additional File 1 Of the 63 prolines occurring in the PRR 62 98 are conserved in the corresponding region of human RNase III Repetitive proline sequences tend to adopt a polyproline II PPII helix consisting of an extended structure with three residues per turn A proline at every third position serves to stabilize the structure 20 and also participates in hydrogen bonds as well as in hydrophobic interactions 21 The presence of a PRR in mouse RNase III suggests protein protein interactions important for function PRR mediated interactions are relatively weak and reversible and occur with the PPII helix in the C terminal domain of RNA polymerase II during transcription initiation and elongation 22 The Arginine Serine RS domain The mouse RNase III polypeptide contains an RS domain adjacent to the PRR see Additional File 1 The 13 positions containing the RS SR dipeptide motif are shared between the mouse and human polypeptides with an overall 87 sequence identity with the human sequence containing an additional SR dipeptide RS domains participate in protein protein interactions and RS domain containing proteins play essential roles in constitutive or alternative mRNA splicing 23 24 25 RS proteins bind RNA via an RNA recognition motif RRM allowing subsequent recruitment of splicing components via RS domain interactions The presence of this domain in mouse RNase III suggests similar protein protein interactions involved in RNA maturation which may be functionally associated with components of the RNA splicing and transport machinery Potential sites of post translational modification Psort analysis of the predicted mouse RNase III amino acid sequence indicates three potential nuclear localization signals positioned at residues 254 355 and 508 see Additional File 1 A Prosite scan identified multiple potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C casein kinase II and cAMP dependent protein kinase data not shown Some of these signals may be involved in protein localization as it has been shown that human RNase III localizes to the nucleolus during the cell cycle S phase 18 Mouse RNase III transcript expression patterns The transcript expression patterns were analyzed by RT PCR and by northern blot Figures 4A 4B The analyses show that the mouse RNase III transcript is expressed in all adult organs examined as well as in the E13 5 midgestation embryo the extraembryonic yolk sac and the placenta Northern analysis Figure 4B reveals a transcript size of 4 5 kb which is consistent with the predicted length of the cDNA including a poly A tail The northern analysis also reveals that the transcript is heavily expressed in brain tissue and perhaps also heart tissue while only lightly expressed in skeletal muscle The reason s for the differential levels of expression is unclear but it is of interest to note that the mouse Dicer transcript is also prominently expressed in brain and heart tissue while only lightly expressed in skeletal muscle 17 Interestingly an additional species 3 5 kb is present in testis Figure 4B which may represent an alternatively processed form of the transcript This species is not seen in the testis lane of the RT PCR analysis since the PCR primers are targeted to the 3 UTR which is most likely the same for the two transcripts Chromosomal locations of the mouse and human ribonuclease III genes The mouse RNase III gene was mapped using fluorescent in situ hybridization FISH employing a partial cDNA clone as probe The gene is located in the proximal segment region B of chromosome 15 Figure 5A The human ribonuclease III gene was mapped to chromosome 5p13 p14 Figure 5B a region that is syntenic to mouse chromosome 15B Conclusions Sequence database searches and other studies 17 have revealed only two RNase III orthologues Dicer and RNase III in the mouse and human genomes However the presence of an additional RNase III specific transcript in at least one tissue indicates the possibility of alternative forms of RNase III The broad expression pattern suggests a conserved cellular function for mouse RNase III In this regard sequence database searches and a southern zoo blot data not shown indicate significant conservation of the RNase III gene among many other vertebrates including rat rabbit and cow However functional roles for mammalian RNase III have yet to be fully defined A role in rRNA maturation is suggested by the observation that antisense oligodeoxynucleotide mediated reduction in human RNase III levels also causes a decrease in the amount of 5 8 S rRNA and a concomitant increase in the 12 S precursor 18 A similar defect in rRNA maturation is seen upon U8 snoRNA depletion in Xenopus oocytes 26 As U8 snoRNA participates in rRNA maturation it is possible that an RNase III dependent step also involves U8 snoRNA Alternatively a role for RNase III in the maturation of U8 snoRNA as well as other snoRNAs is a possibility In this regard the S cerevisiae RNase III orthologue Rnt1p not only cleaves the 35 S rRNA precursor within the 3 ETS 27 28 29 but also processes snoRNA and snRNA precursors 30 31 32 33 Further biochemical studies are
