 Hail Caesar President Clinton s State of the Union address was greeted around the world this week as the possible harbinger of another miraculous comeback The Hong Kong Standard said Thursday that if Mr Clinton s was a bravura performance in the face of so much adversity it was also because he had facts and figures to back his claim that the United States was not only strong but also brimming with confidence It seemed somehow as if the personal confidence he brought to the White House had been transferred to the nation itself Those still wondering whether to impeach him might well think carefully now before committing themselves to an obviously unpopular cause In Japan the daily Asahi Shimbun said Thursday that his speech went right to the heart of American values Clinton came across as a president concerned with the daily lives of working men and women over whom impeachment appears to cast no shadow His effort to regain prestige and recover the cohesion of an administration damaged by the impeachment process must have been at least temporarily successful the paper said adding that it is likely that he will continue to conduct an aggressive foreign policy In Israel the Jerusalem Post took his pledge to work for the day when Iraq has a government worthy of its people as a signal that he will try to depose Saddam Hussein In Italy the Turin paper La Stampa carried a front page editorial Thursday comparing Clinton to Julius Caesar Under the headline The Return of Super Bill commentator Gabriele Romagnoli wrote Caesar climbed the steps of the Capitol entered the hall of his judges looked everyone in the face including a few Brutuses and then great showman that he is smiled and in a 77 minute one man show he conquered the theatre 98 ovations and the public 6 percent rise in his popularity It concluded Such a Caesar can survive the Ides of March Especially because in saying that the State of the Union is in excellent health he certainly wasn t committing perjury But the Rome paper La Repubblica focused in an editorial Thursday on the power of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan whom it depicted as being like Hillary Clinton a second surrogate president Under the headline Duel in Washington the editorial said that Greenspan by publicly ridiculing the president s plan for investing 700 billion in the Social Security system had effectively rejected the key point of his State of the Union address The affair demonstrates that the much admired Clinton model has up to now had a secret manager Greenspan who is to all intents and purposes the principal architect of that inflation free economic boom which the president has used as a shield against the criticisms linked to Sexgate the paper said In Paris Le Monde said Clinton staked his all in his address challenging the Republicans to work with a president they want to topple or else enter the November 2000 elections under the banner of an impeachment party that abandoned a popular program to satisfy its rancor In Russia Izvestia commented Thursday on a U S Russian territorial dispute in the Bering Strait the subject of negotiations that ended inconclusively in Seattle last weekend The border barely 49 kilometers long was so short that it was difficult to find on maps the paper said but it has created considerable problems in bilateral relations and looks set to generate drawn out political battles The chief Russian delegate at the Seattle talks said their only achievement had been a phrase in the final communiqu mentioning the need to search for a compromise solution to this problem On the other hand the paper said that recognition of the importance of compromise was better than open confrontation especially in a region regarded by both sides as vital to their interests and where troops were kept in a state of high combat readiness In the matter of corruption and the Olympic Games the Sydney Morning Herald claimed an exclusive Saturday with a front page lead story claiming that Sydney only won the right to host the 2000 Olympics by offering 50 000 inducements to two African members of the International Olympic Committee just hours before the vote The Herald quoted the president of the Australian Olympic Committee John Coates as saying he had offered the money at a dinner in Monte Carlo to the National Olympic Committees of Kenya and Uganda through their respective IOC members Charles Mukora and Maj Gen Francis Nyangweso My view was it might encourage them to consider their votes for Sydney Coates said He reportedly denied that the money was a bribe and said it went toward helping sport in Kenya and Uganda The paper said that the revelation is certain to draw Sydney into the bribes furor which has already caused two IOC delegates to resign over the scandal surrounding Salt Lake City Utah s successful bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics
