 November 15 1990 Name Address City ST Zip Dear Name The Indiana University School of Law Indianapolis continues to make significant strides in legal education As a member of the law school s __ I know you are aware of our progress We consistently for example attract top students the 1990 entering class had the highest Law School Admission Test scores in our history and more than 10 of our new students possess graduate degrees in addition to their undergraduate diplomas Our students moreover consistently have the highest success rate of any law school graduates on passing the Indiana Bar exam On the February and July 1990 exams our pass rates were 96 5 and 91 4 Besides a talented and diverse student body our law school boasts an outstanding faculty In addition to fine teaching and impressive scholarship the faculty make important professional contributions through service on boards and commissions participating in continuing legal education programs and bar association activities With all our successes the law school still has many opportunities for growth and improvement It takes a partnership of private support and University funding to sustain and expand our leadership role in legal education The law library houses the most highly automated legal research collection in the state However dramatic increases in the costs of law books journals and database services mean that simply maintaining our present collections exceeds our budget Our faculty student ratio is 1 27 For law schools in the United States the range of faculty student ratios is from 1 13 to 1 35 but well over half of the law schools in the country have better ratios than we do Competition among law schools for the strongest students is intense Scholarships often are critical in enrolling top students in financial need During 1989 the law school had only 130 000 in scholarships to award students After twenty years the law school building needs considerable refurbishing especially in areas used by our students While we don t attract capable students or outstanding faculty by the facility alone it is important that we maintain an attractive environment for maximum learning As a leader of the law school I urge you to consider a significant annual gift of at least 1 000 and become a member of the Maennerchor Society Members of this group through their leadership continue to demonstrate that private support can lead to significant improvements at the law school Your gift can be made in one payment two semi annual payments or on a quarterly basis Your annual gift to the law school is an investment in its continued excellence Sincerely Norman Lefstein Dean
