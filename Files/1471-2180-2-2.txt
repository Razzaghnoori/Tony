 Background Johne s disease also called paratuberculosis is a chronic granulomatous enteritis of ruminant animals caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis M paratuberculosis While Johne s disease can end in death of the animal the economic impact of this disease is much more significant 1 2 Losses are estimated to be 200 clinically infected cow year and are a result of animal culling reduced milk production poor reproductive performance and reduced carcass value 1 3 Research on the pathogenesis and immunology of M paratuberculosis infections of cattle is necessary to allow design of more rational diagnostic and control procedures A small number of specialized microorganisms can survive inside macrophages designed specifically to kill bacteria However a hallmark of mycobacterial pathogenesis is their ability to survive and even replicate within macrophages These include Mycobacteria Salmonella Listeria Coxiella and Corynebacteria Different mechanisms are employed as survival strategies and the mycobacteria are exceptional in the duration and persistence of this interaction Survival of pathogenic mycobacteria is attributed to the fact that the mycobacterial phagosome does not fuse with lysosomes 4 5 6 The mechanism that prevents phagosome maturation is still unknown as are any mycobacterial genes that contribute to the delayed maturation Several studies surrounding the interactions of M paratuberculosis with macrophages have been published because of its importance in pathogenesis These studies include entry into J774 macrophages 7 8 an electron microscopic examination of goat tissue 9 10 and an assessment of intracellular fate of M paratuberculosis within bovine monocytes macrophages 11 12 However many assumptions regarding M paratuberculosis interactions with macrophages are based on analogies to M tuberculosis 13 or M avium 14 In this communication we present an analysis of M paratuberculosis survival within J774 macrophages using transmission electron microscopy to show temporal events early during infection Results Viability of M paratuberculosiswithin resting J774 macrophages The growth of M paratuberculosis was measured at early stages during infection of non activated macrophages Growth was measured by bacterial cell counts following serial dilutions on HEYM slants The cell counts from three independent experiments showed a slow decline in M paratuberculosis viability over 7 days Fig 1 After infection an initial growth phase occurred until 24 hours postinfection where mycobacterial counts began to decline In two of the three experiments an increase in bacterial counts occurred after 70 hours postinfection up until 95 hours where a second decline in viable mycobacteria occurred These data suggest that while M paratuberculosis survives much longer in macrophages than some pathogens 15 16 including other species of mycobacteria 17 there remains a significant decrease in viability over time Immunoelectron microscopy of intracellular M paratuberculosis Because the viability of M paratuberculosis decreased with time it was of interest to examine the progression of M paratuberculosis infection by immunoelectron microscopy However a reliable method to label intracellular mycobacteria needed to be developed first Therefore rabbit antibodies against a whole cell sonicated lysate of M paratuberculosis were affinity purified These purified antibodies labeled the outer periphery of Middlebrook 7H9 cultured M paratuberculosis Fig 2C This purified antibody preparation was then used to label M paratuberculosis within infected macrophages Fig 2Aand 2B The purified antibody was highly specific as all gold particles are associated with the mycobacteria and no labeling of the surrounding background or macrophages was observed Control preparations of uninfected macrophages failed to label with antibody against M paratuberculosis data not shown Note the mycobacterial morphology remained constant when comparing intracellular with extracellular bacilli compare Fig 2Bwith Fig 2C Temporal events during M paratuberculosisinfection of J774 macrophages Macrophages were infected with M paratuberculosis at a 5 1 ratio and fixed in glutaraldehyde at various time points to examine the development of mycobacteria in this environment Fig 3 Vacuoles harboring mycobacteria appeared tightly arranged and not spacious as previously observed in Coxiella burnetii containing vacuoles 18 19 The mycobacteria themselves were in very close contact with each other The size number and morphology of the mycobacteria appeared to remain relatively constant throughout the observed time period At all times postinfection mycobacteria were mostly found as groups inside vacoules Occasionally single bacilli were observed within a tight vacuole An increase in the percentage of degraded mycobacteria was observed with time There were two degraded bacilli per 25 fields at 24 hour postinfection and 12 degraded bacilli per 13 fields at 72 hours postinfection Similar data were obtained in two independent experiments Degraded mycobacteria were morphologically unrecognizable but did label with immunogold indicating the presence of M paratuberculosis antigen Fig 4 These data indicate that macrophages can kill and degrade a percentage of mycobacterial cells in a given infection We next examined the outcome of mycobacteria within heavily infected macrophages J774 macrophages were infected with M paratuberculosis at high multiplicities of infection 30 1 and examined at various times post infection fig 5 Extracellular mycobacteria were phagocytosed via actin rearrangement and remain within phagosomal vacuoles dispersed throughout the cytoplasm fig 5Aand 5B At least 20 infected macrophages were examined at each time point Note the electron transparent lipid vesicles present within M paratuberculosis These electron transparent vesicles were seen at all time points examined At 48 hr postinfection fig 5C the cytoplasm of the macrophage is loaded with mycobacterial containing vacuoles By 72 hr postinfection the macrophage cytoplasm is dark and the cell appears necrotic possibly due to the heavy mycobacterial load or apoptosis Severe membrane sloughing or blebbing seen to the right of the macrophage and identified by the arrows in Fig 5Dis a sign of apoptosis 20 21 22 No degraded mycobacteria were observed in these experiments Therefore at high levels of infection it appears that mycobacteria survive while the host macrophage is killed Whereas the outcome is reversed at lower moi Discussion Growth and survival of mycobacterial species within macrophages has been an area of intensive study because of its implications in pathogenicity For example M bovis has been shown to grow within macrophages whereas BCG strains do not 23 This observation is controversial since there are reports of immunocompromised patients with disseminated BCG Although multi species studies are complex and multi factorial M avium appears to be able to survive in secondary lysosomes better than does M tuberculosis 18 In macrophages co infected with Coxiella burnetii an intracellular pathogen known to inhabit and replicate within secondary lysosomes 19 M avium growth was not impaired 18 Whereas M tuberculosis bacilli that co localized with C burnetii containing vacuoles did show reduced growth 18 A recent report by Thomsen et al 24 showed a higher percentage of degraded M paratuberculosis in euthymic as compared to athymic mice The in vivo study by Thomsen supports data from our in vitro study indicating that J774 cultured macrophages are a good model for pathogenesis studies Many bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus are rapidly endocytosed and digested by macrophages within a few hours postinfection 25 The present study showed an initial 25 hour intracellular growth period of M paratuberculosis followed by a slow decline in the viability within macrophages over a period of 7 days This survival curve is similar to that observed by Zhao et al 12 which showed M paratuberculosis intracellular growth in the first six days followed by killing after day six The experiments described herein were performed using the type strain of M paratuberculosis which may have affected the survivability within macrophages since it is not a recent field isolate However M paratuberculosis 6783 17 and M paratuberculosis BO45 12 are field isolates that have both showed a decline in viability inside macrophages over time although much slower than observed with the type strain No attempt has been made to activate the macrophages in this study although several laboratories have shown that macrophages activated with cytokines such as interferon increase the ability to kill mycobacteria 26 27 28 29 30 A very recent communication of M paratuberculosis interactions with macrophages was published during the course of our experiments 17 This comprehensive study showed that M paratuberculosis containing vacuoles were mildly acidified pH 6 3 as compared to latex beads pH 5 2 In addition the M paratuberculosis phagosome was characterized by the presence of LAMP 1 and absence of LAMP 2 lysosomal membrane protein markers as well as other endocytic tracer molecules These cell biology studies clearly add to our understanding of M paratuberculosis interactions with macrophages This study has also provided a general description of early events in M paratuberculosis infection of cultured macrophages Several intracellular pathogens such as Chlamydia or Coxiella undergo readily distinguishable morphological changes during infection of host cells 31 32 This is clearly not the case for M paratuberculosis or other mycobacteria as they remain morphologically similar at least up until 4 days postinfection However an increased percentage of degraded mycobacterial forms was observed over time These degraded forms appeared by 24 hours postinfection and were hardly recognizable morphologically but did label with immunogold particles indicating the presence of mycobacterial antigen At low moi the bacilli were tightly clustered into a single vacuole throughout the observed time period This mycobacterial vacuole is most likely characteristic of a late endosome based on previous studies with M avium M tuberculosis 33 34 and M paratuberculosis 17 All intracellular bacterial pathogens enter host cells surrounded by a membrane bound vacuole 35 36 Some pathogens in heavily infected cells collect into a single vacuole within the same cell 37 J774 macrophages infected at a moi of 5 1 showed separate M paratuberculosis containing vacuoles within the same macrophage even after 48 hours postinfection Figure 2 Likewise M tuberculosis and M avium appear to remain in distinct phagosomes that do not harbor more than one bacilli per vacuole see Figures 1Aand 4Bin 38 for example However in M avium infected macrophages one of the first phenotypic alterations following activation with cytokines is the coalescence of individual M avium containing vacuoles into communal vacuoles with many bacilli 26 The significance of separate M paratuberculosis containing vacuoles observed in this study is still unclear There appears to be a tenuous relationship to gain control between M paratuberculosis and the macrophage with survival at stake The macrophage can control growth and even kill M paratuberculosis However the mycobacteria are cytotoxic to macrophages or induce apoptosis at high moi The mechanism that enables M paratuberculosis to persist within cattle for several years remains unclear as high moi are not likely observed at early stages of Johne s disease Conclusions In vitro assays to quantify survival of bacteria in macrophages provide useful insights into host pathogen relations The results of this study provides further insight surrounding M paratuberculosis macrophage infections and have implications in the pathogenesis of M paratuberculosis a pathogen known to persist inside cattle for many years Further studies need to address the tenuous relationship between mycobacteria and macrophage in relation to disease outcome Materials and methods Bacterial strains and growth conditions M paratuberculosis ATCC19698 was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth pH 6 0
