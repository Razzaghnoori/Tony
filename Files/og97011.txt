SECURITIES OFFERINGS RIN 3235 AF54 i Cost benefit analysis The Securities and Exchange Commission SEC stated in its report to us that it was not required to prepare and did not prepare a cost benefit analysis of the rule Instead pursuant to section 23 a 2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 15 U S C 78w a 2 the SEC is directed to consider the impact that the rule may have on competition The SEC believes that the benefits of the rule outweigh the costs attributed to it since it will significantly ease the regulatory burden by eliminating the trading restrictions for underwriters of actively traded securities reducing the restricted periods for other securities provide a more flexible framework for stabilizing transactions expanding the securities eligible for Nasdaq passive market making during an offering and deregulating rights offerings The SEC expects the rule will cause the costs associated with offerings to decrease significantly and also decrease the costs of distributions Recordingkeeping requirements are estimated to cost 2 500 000 annually for broker dealers to comply with the rule ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 Section 603 Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis In its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 61 Fed Reg 17107 April 18 1996 the SEC included a summary of its Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis In accordance with sections 603 b 1 and 2 the SEC describes the reasons for the proposed agency actions and its objectives and legal basis In discussing various alternatives to the proposed rule the SEC decided that since small entities will benefit from the less restrictive nature of the rule acceptance of any of the alternatives was not preferable to the rule as proposed GAO OGC 97 11 Section 604 Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The SEC published a summary of its Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in the preamble to the final rule and provided our Office with a copy of the full text of the analysis The analysis provides a statement of the need for and the objective of the rule and the fact that there were no comments received with respect to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The analysis discusses the definitions of small entities for the various entities subject to the rule which definitions were adopted by the SEC in Securities Exchange Release No 18452 dated January 28 1982 While no firm estimate of the number of small entities subject to various provisions of the rule is given the overall effect of the rule for small entities will be beneficial through a shorter cooling off period and increased eligibility for passive market making The analysis also addresses the various alternatives to the final rule which were considered including differing compliance or reporting requirements use of performance rather than design standards and an exemption for small entities from coverage of the rule These alternatives were rejected because the burden of compliance was not that great for small entities or because of the need for investor protection iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C
