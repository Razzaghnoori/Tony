 Voice Over Russ Bust the union indeed I m for unions on principle and in practical self interested terms the union was what allowed me to make some semblance of a decent living when I worked there not to mention its role in representing a militant staff culture and defending the autonomy of editors and writers especially in the Murdoch era but all that aside the union has nothing to do with the Voice s editorial problems The Voice was much better in the 80s when the union was stronger relatively speaking not that it was ever really strong but it seems totally toothless now On the contrary the Voice has been done in by 90s corporate culture with its emphasis on cost cutting its cult of efficiency and its deep distrust of creative work because it s ultimately unquantifiable and resistant to control from the top If a publication is built around writers with strong individual views and identities and people read the paper because of those writers it gives the writers and editors a lot of power and I think it has suited Leonard Stern s business agenda I m not suggesting it s a conscious conspiracy for the Voice to stop being a writer s paper Free distribution also changes the nature of the readership and the relationship between readers and writers people aren t shelling out money to read particular writers and it s harder for writers to tell who their audience is A while ago I had a conversation with the Voice s managing editor in which he said I was one in a long line of Embittered Alumni I thought that was witty and briefly considered making up a Village Voice Embittered Alumni button But in fact I m not bitter the Voice was where I really developed as a writer and editor and I m grateful to it on the whole I m just frustrated I think the paper served a crucial function as a space for cultural reporting and analysis and culturally radical ideas that were censored elsewhere and it isn t serving that function anymore nor has any other publication come close to replacing it The Voice was the first publication to give a forum to pro sex feminists the first so far as I know to blow the whistle on the ritual sex abuse day care trials There was a time when something like the Monica Lewinsky scandal would have prompted an outpouring of debate and analysis from all angles If something like Littleton happened the Voice would have sent a reporter out there for a few weeks and would have had the best story on what was really going on there And so on Well R I P Time s up See you in New York
