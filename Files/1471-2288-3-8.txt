 Background Missing outcome data are common in clinical studies 1 2 Many approaches assume missing at random MAR as a base case MAR means that the probability of missing depends only on observed variables 3 Four strategies for examining the bias or sensitivity of results when MAR does not hold are to i fit all saturated MAR and non MAR missing data models 4 5 ii add a parameter to various MAR models to make them non MAR and test if the fit is significantly improved 6 7 iii impute the missing data in one arm using the observed proportion of events in the other arm 8 9 iv estimate results under a non MAR missing data mechanism with key parameters specified by the investigator 1 10 13 We propose a variation of method iv for randomized trials with binary outcome that explicitly uses the randomization distribution to reduce user input To our knowledge this is the only method that exploits the randomization distribution for missing data adjustment We illustrate the methodology using data from the Polyp Prevention Trial PPT in which 2079 men and women with recently removed colorectal adenoma were randomized to receive either intensive counseling to adopt a low fat diet intervention or a standard brochure on healthy eating control 14 The binary outcome was at least one adenoma detected on colonoscopy following randomization In the control arm 9 of the subjects were missing the outcome and in the intervention arm 7 were missing the outcome Dropping the data from subjects with a missing outcome gives an estimated difference of 002 s e 022 in the probability of adenoma recurrence between the intervention and control groups Thus there was very little evidence that intensive counseling to adopt a low fat diet reduced the probability of adenoma recurrence An important question was whether or not an adjustment for the missing outcomes would have changed this conclusion Methods Adjusting for Observed Covariates As a starting point we assume the data are missing at random MAR Let Y denote the binary outcome of adenoma recurrence Let Z 0 denote random assignment to the control group and Z 1 denote random assignment to the intervention group Also let R 0 if the outcome is missing and 1 if the outcome is observed Suppose we also have data on the observed variable S which represents either strata formed by the cross classification of categorical baseline covariates or outpoints of a continuous variable Under the MAR assumption the probability of missing depends on Z and S but not Y namely pr R 1 z s Y 1 pr R 1 z s 1 Because R and Y are conditionally independent given Z and S it follows from 1 that pr Y 1 z s R 1 pr Y 1 z s 2 In other words under the MAR assumption in 1 the probability of adenoma recurrence conditional on treatment assignment and baseline covariates is the same in all subjects as in subjects not missing outcome Baker and Laird 6 proved the related result that under MAR the maximum likelihood estimate of the probability of outcome conditional on covariates is the same in all subjects as in subjects not missing outcome With binary outcomes the overall measure of treatment effect is typically a difference a relative risk or an odds ratio We focus on the difference because it is easy to interpret 15 and because it simplifies our formulation Let s denote the treatment effect for stratum 5 namely s pr Y 1 Z 1 s pr Y 1 Z 0 s 3 By virtue of the randomization pr S s Z 1 pr S s Z 0 pr S s Therefore we can write the overall treatment effect as s s pr S s 4 If the missing data mechanism is given in 1 then from 2 the treatment effect in stratum s 3 equals the treatment effect in stratum s among subjects with observed outcomes s pr Y 1 Z 1 s R 1 pr Y 1 Z 0 s R 1 5 Let n zsy denote the number of subjects in treatment group z and stratum s who have observed outcome y Based on 5 we estimate s by d s q s 1 q s 0 where q sz n zs 1 n zs 6 where denotes summation over the indicated subscript Let N zs denote the number of subjects with either observed or missing outcomes in treatment group z and stratum s We estimate pr S s by w s N s N giving an overall estimate of treatment effect s d s w s 7 The estimate in 7 is closely related to the estimate proposed by Horvitz and Thompson 16 It is also maximum likelihood because it is a function of maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters Using the delta method and noting that d 1 w 1 d 2 w 2 d h 1 w h 1 d h 1 we obtain where w h 1 Bias from an omitted binary covariate Suppose that instead of 1 the probability of missingness depends on treatment assignment baseline strata and an unobserved binary covariate x For our example from the Polyp Prevention Trial x could be an unreported indicator of a family history of colon cancer Then pr R 1 z s x Y 1 pr R 1 z s x 9 In other words the data would be MAR if x were observed The model in 9 implies that when x is not observed missingness depends on outcome and on treatment group via We assume that for each level of x within stratum s the treatment effect is the same namely s pr Y 1 Z 1 s x pr Y 1 Z 0 s x pr Y 1 Z 1 s x R 1 pr Y 1 Z 0 s x R 1 from 9 11 Importantly s in 11 does not depend on x Let denote the apparent treatment effect in stratum s after collapsing over x namely To formalize the relationship between and s let xs pr Y 1 Z 0 s x R 1 13 s 1 s 0 s 14 zs pr X 1 z s R 1 15 s 1 s 0 s 16 Combining 11 and 13 we can write pr Y 1 Z 1 s x R 1 xs s 17 Substituting 13 17 into 12 gives For a tabular display of these calculations see Table 1 For a graphical depiction based on the BK plot 17 18 see Figure 1 From 18 the bias from omitting x in stratum s is s s The first factor s pr Y 1 Z 0 s X 1 R 1 pr Y 1 Z 0 s X 0 R 1 19 is the effect of X on subjects in the control group with observed outcomes By virtue of the MAR assumption in 9 we could also write s pr Y 1 Z 0 s X 1 pr Y 1 Z 0 5 X 0 which is the effect of X on all subjects in the control group The second factor s pr X 1 Z 1 s Z 1 pr X 1 Z 0 s R 1 20 ranges from 1 to 1 and measures the degree of confounding between X and Z among subjects with observed outcomes i e R 1 If s 0 there is no confounding and no bias because the distribution of X among subjects with observed outcomes is the same in the control and study group If s 1 there is complete confounding and the bias reaches the maximum value of s Taking a weighted average over all strata the overall apparent treatment effect is and the overall bias is bias s s s w s 22 Remarkably it is possible to obtain simple bounds on s based only on the proportion of subjects who are missing in each randomized group in stratum s Let zs pr R 1 z s 23 denote the proportion of subjects in randomization group z and stratum s with an observed outcome As derived in the Appendix See additional file 1 the maximum s which we call the upper bound factor is If only 15 of the subjects are missing in each arm max s is less than 18 If we let max denote the anticipated maximum value of s then substituting 24 into 22 gives the anticipated maximum bias bias max max s max s w s 25 where the anticipated maximum bias under complete confounding max is specified by the investigator the upper bound factor max s is based on the fraction with observed outcomes in stratum s and w s is the fraction of subjects in stratum s Thus the investigator need only specify max One might argue that if x were a strong unobserved inherited gene max would be close to 1 However because eligible subjects had no history of colorectal cancer surgical resection of adenomas bowel resection the polyposis syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease 14 it is unlikely that many subjects had an unobserved high penetrance gene related to the recurrence of adenomas We therefore believe that unobserved factors that might affect both adenoma recurrence and missingness could have an effect of similar magnitude as observed baseline covariates Thus to obtain a plausible value for max we suggest estimating s as defined in 19 based on observed covariates See the Results section Of course the relationship between observed covariates and missingness could differ substantially from the relationship between an unobserved covariate and missingness Nevertheless we believe that estimates of s from observed covariates are helpful for specifying a realistic value for max Additional file 1 Click here for file Results We applied our approach to data from the PPT trial stratified by age and sex Table 2 We first assumed MAR and applied 7 and 8 to estimate the difference in the probabilities of adenoma recurrence between the two groups We obtained 003 with se 022 which is close to the unstratified estimate and its standard error To compute the anticipated maximum bias 25 we first computed max s using 24 and estimated w s from the observed fractions Table 2 This gave s max s w s 10 We then specified max the anticipated maximum bias under complete confounding To obtain a plausible value for max we estimated s in 19 pretending either sex or age was the unobserved covariate x This gave 23 18 18 19 for the four age categories when x sex and 07 and 09 for the two sex categories when x age Treating the largest as a realistic lower bound for max we specified a slightly larger value max 25 so that the anticipated maximum bias is bias max 25 10 025 The MAR confidence interval is shifted to the right or left by the anticipated maximum bias Figure 2 For purpose of comparison we also computed estimates and confidence intervals under a worst best case imputation 9 19 where missing outcome data in each stratum were imputed as no recurrence recurrence in controls and recurrence no recurrence in the intervention group These stratum specific estimates were combined over strata using weights inversely proportional to the stratum specific variances In the worst and best case imputations the confidence intervals did not overlap zero Figure 2 Our sensitivity analysis showed that the worst and best case imputations were too extreme Because the absolute value of the anticipated maximum bias 025 is smaller than 1 96 se 043 the bias adjusted confidence intervals overlap zero Thus the anticipated maximum bias of 025 did not change our conclusion of little evidence of an effect of treatment on adenoma recurrence However it did increase our uncertainty as the more extreme lower and upper bounds indicated that the true effect of treatment could likely be higher or lower than indicated by the original analysis Discussion The key idea of our method is to incorporate non MAR missingness by postulating an unobserved binary covariate Although similar in spirit to using an unobserved binary covariate with observational data 20 randomization adds important extra information that can be usefully exploited Our formulation implies that the probability of missingness depends on both outcome and treatment assignment The proposed methods hinges on first selecting the appropriate baseline covariates We agree with Myers 21 that if one anticipates missing data one should collect information on the baseline covariates related to outcome that might predict missing in outcome We assumed that within a stratum the effect of treatment did not depend on the unobserved binary covariate We view this as a main effect and thus a reasonable approximation We also agree with Shih 1 that one should collect information on the cause of missingness In particular we recommend reporting whether any of the missing outcomes were definitely MAR for example due to random technical problems to accidents or to leaving the study for reasons completely unrelated to the investigation Suppose that outcome was definitely MAR in a proportion v zs of subjects Then it is more informative to write v zs as pr R 1 not MAR z s v zs Because v zs contains no information about the effect of X on missingness one can replace zs by zs v zs which reduces max s and hence reduces the anticipated maximum bias Although we applied our methodology to a cross classification of categorical covariates it could also be applied to continuous covariates or a univariate combination of covariates in a manner analogous to a propensity score 22 Let u denote a vector of covariates and e z pr R 1 z u Following the derivation of propensity scores 22 we can write pr R 1 z e z E r z e z E E r z u z e z E e z z e z e z Therefore pr R 1 z u pr R 1 z e z and thus e z contains the same information for the probability of being observed as u This calculation justifies using e z to summarize the covariates predicting missingness To form five strata for randomized group z we would compute e z for each subject in group z and then divide the distribution of e z into quintiles Conclusion The bias due to an unobserved binary covariate could arise when the probability of missingness depends on both treatment and outcome Computation of the bias is easy because it equals the maximum anticipated bias under complete confounding multiplied by an upper bound factor The maximum anticipated bias might require some expert input but some lower bound values can be obtained using observed baseline covariate The upper bound factor is easily computed from the fraction missing in each group The methodology is particularly useful in the common situation when no more than 15 of the subjects in excess of those definitely MAR have missing outcomes so that the upper bound factor in the bias is less than 18 Contributions SGB devised the basic model with the unobserved covariate
