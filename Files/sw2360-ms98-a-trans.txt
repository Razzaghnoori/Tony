uh huh well our topic is uh TV shows you ready to get started well TV shows yeah what we like about them our favorites and so forth uh yeah i guess i am okay i ll go ahead and punch one okay fine Jerry okay i guess my favorites are probably the the uh news format programs like Hard Copy Sixty Minutes Twenty Twenty uh Current Affair things like that uh huh we watch a lot of that also we watch uh CNN a lot yeah and then i think one of my favorite shows is LA Law yeah we don t have cable unfortunately so we just get but we ve got plenty of local stations to look at uh huh but uh uh we have cable here yeah about the only reason i would want cable probably is is for some of the uh sports programs i see that they don t show local right yeah like HSEN ESPN but the music movie show uh cables or movie channels they show the same shows over and over and over well that s right and we never have signed up for those i just haven t been interested in what they generally have on and um and they re usually would be just as happy not to have them in the house yeah but uh do you have small kids no nope we uh our family s grown in fact we ve just been retired for about a year we took early retirement and okay oh just really enjoying ourselves i wished i could do that i ve been TI thirty two years is that right yeah but i m only fifty seven well so i ve still got a few years to go uh my husbands fifty five and i m a couple of years older well he s fifty seven i m a couple years older than that time goes by yeah yeah but he was with IBM fa thirty years yeah and decided he d had enough of it well i ve had enough of it but unfortunately they don t pay enough for early retirement do you still have children do you have children at home no huh uh no all my kids are grown married right well our daughter in Texas is working for TI uh on a part time basis so that s how we found out about this calling uh huh yeah but uh every once in a while i like to watch some of the old movies i watched a Clint Eastwood movie last night um hum well we watched the ACC play offs or i guess yeah oh yeah uh in in fact it s on tonight rooting for Duke University rooting for Duke University yeah yeah it ought to be a good uh good game tonight yeah that s on right it s on again tonight it it doesn t start until seven o clock our time so we still got another hour um hum uh are you all behind what time is it there it s six o clock here now it s uh it s seven o clock here right seven o clock so you all are behind us right we ve just been watching the national news yeah but uh i wish our time were like yours and then we could get i like to watch Johnny Carson and watch the eleven o clock news but it makes it so late yeah makes it so late well we re fixing to go on daylight saving time uh next this next weekend uh huh i think we do to so we have to run our clocks up forward an hour and i sure do hate to loose that hour of sleep in the morning i hate it too i just would rather stay the way it is yeah but uh well i guess like like like i said my favorite show what s your favorite shows or you like the news formats i like i like the i like some of the dramas yeah shows and i like mysteries yeah i like uh the true life adventures too but uh huh we like uh we get the uh Financial News Network yeah and we like to watch that check up on what s happening with all the stocks and yeah i i don t uh watch too much of the of the uh network shows i all i like to watch uh let s see some of the the uh prime time shows that i like to watch like i said or other news formats but then every once in a while i ll watch Star Search uh huh uh but uh not too many of the situatio n comedies do i care for no i don t care for those and i m definitely not a soap fan too much the only crazy comedy i really like is Saturday Night Live yeah or uh i do you ever watch that yeah and i like uh Totally Hidden Video uh huh we don t watch that much and uh Super uh what is it uh uh Bloopers and Super Practical Jokes right uh huh but um uh i don t know how people stay at home and watch soaps and get involved in them but no i don t either i just don t have any interest i guess plenty of people do yeah they had a program on the other day about people that were addicted to soap operas yeah in fact i think you can even uh order a magazine that keeps you up to date every day of what happened on every particular soap in case you miss it uh huh but uh that that s not real life to me so uh no i think it d be an awful waste of time yeah well i enjoyed talking with you and well enjoyed it too
