 What to Do Sports Most visitors to the Costa del Sol do not plan daytime activities more energetic than lazing on the beach and save their energy for nightlife However sports facilities are in abundance for those who want to work off the effects of too much paella during the daylight hours Water Sports The main resort beaches offer all kinds of sports equipment for rent as well as beach umbrellas and loungers The larger beach restaurants have toilet facilities and some provide changing rooms Swimming With more than 160 km 100 miles of beaches the Costa del Sol offers plenty of spots for swimming Most of the sandy strands lie to the west of M laga while shingle and rocks with some sandy coves predominate to the east In the high season the most popular beaches are mobbed You stand the best chance of finding a patch of sand to yourself to the east of Nerja and west of Estepona Many beaches now fly the blue EU flag which means that water quality and general sanitation meets environmental standards established by the European Union Boating There are numerous marinas along the coast between M laga and Sotogrande providing year round moorings for yachts and motor boats Some offer boats for day rentals and longer term charters with or without captain and crew Marbella boasts three such establishments and many of the beaches and larger beach hotels rent sailboats Waterskiing The main resorts all have water skiing schools and most big hotels offer instruction Prices are generally high but they do vary Swimming and skiing areas often overlap Windsurfing This sport is the coast s fastest growing activity with boards sails and professional instruction available in most of the resort areas The season runs from March to November with strongest winds in June and September Snorkeling and Scuba Diving Snorkeling can be an engrossing activity particularly off the rocky indented stretch of coast beyond Nerja If you dive or snorkel any distance from the shore you are legally required to tow a marker buoy Diving centers operate in several resorts For more information contact the local tourist office see page 124 Angling Fishing from the rocks and breakwaters is a popular pastime with the locals and a permit is not required The deeper waters offshore teem with tunny tuna swordfish and shark Deep sea fishing boats can be rented at the marinas and many resort hotels make arrangements for fishing expeditions A very popular inland fishing spot is the Pantanos del Chorro pantano meaning reservoir at the Chorro Dam see page 29 Freshwater anglers must have a permit ask at the nearest tourist office for information on how to obtain one Other Sports Golf When it comes to variety few resort areas in the world can compare with the Costa del Sol There are nearly 30 18 hole courses between M laga and Gibraltar Most private and hotel clubs welcome non residents or non members though some may charge visitors a higher fee Clubs caddies and carts are generally available for rental The quality of the courses is excellent many have been designed by such famous names as Robert Trent Jones and Seve Ballesteros Las Brisas near Marbella has hosted the Spanish Open and Valderrama near Sotogrande was host to the 1997 Ryder Cup Although a private club Valderrama has nine starting times between midday and 2pm that are open to the public albeit at 30 000 ptas a180 3 per round For details of golf courses and fees consult the monthly magazine Costa Golf an English language publication Tennis and Squash Some of the biggest names in tennis are linked to the numerous clubs centers and ranches on the Costa del Sol including the Marbella based Manolo Santana Tennis Club which hosts the majority of Spain s Davis Cup matches and other important tournaments Bicycling Bikes can be rented at towns up and down the coast and inland where mountain roads and trails are ideal for mountain biking Hiking There are a number of good hiking areas within easy reach of the coast notably the Montes de M laga National Park just north of M laga and El Torcal and El Chorro a little farther inland see page 28 For more good walks try the area around Ronda and the hills above the Refugio de Juanar near Marbella see page 41 Hunting The foothills of the Sierra Nevada harbor rabbit and partridge while deeper in the mountains lurk deer There are hunting grounds in the area north of Marbella especially in the Serran a de Ronda and closer to the coast the Sierra Blanca see page 41 The season for game runs roughly from the months of September December while small animals may generally be hunted from October February A hunting permit is required Horseback Riding Andaluc a is famous for both its horses and horsemanship There are stables on the coast and near the inland cities with mounts for rent you can canter along the open beach or ride up into the hills Skiing Few people think of the Costa del Sol as a ski resort but skiing can be enjoyed between December and May at the Solynieve resort near Granada 160 km 100 miles northeast of M laga in the Sierra Nevada Situated near the summit of mount Veleta it is Europe s southernmost ski resort Shopping Most establishments are open from 9 30 or 10am 1 30 or 2 00pm and from 4 30 8 00pm The siesta see below is still religiously observed in southern Spain In summer shops in the tourist resorts keep longer hours staying open all day until 8 30pm or sometimes later Department stores do not close for the siesta The Spanish government levies a value added tax called IVA on most items currently up to 13 8 Tourists from outside the EU will be refunded the IVA they pay on purchases above a minimum of 15 000 ptas a90 15 or US 100 in stores where they see the TAX FREE SHOPPING logo Whenever you make a purchase simply ask for a Global Refund Check Then when you declare your purchases at Customs your check will be validated The check can then be cashed at a nearby Cash Refund Office or at any of the International Cash Refund offices worldwide Another option that may be more convenient is to mail the check to a Cash Refund Office and have your credit card account automatically credited It s worthwhile if you plan on spending a lot in one place Markets Weekly open air markets are held Mondays in Marbella Tuesdays in Nerja and Fuengirola Wednesdays in Estepona Thursdays in Torremolinos and San Pedro de Alc ntara and Fridays in Benalm dena Most cities have a rastro flea market on Sunday morning Of these Sevilla s is the largest and the town also has a coin and stamp and small animal market on the same day Where to Shop The larger cities offer lower prices and a better selection of goods than resorts like Torremolinos or Fuengirola The El Corte Ingl s department store in M laga Sevilla and other places is also well worth looking for For more sophisticated shopping nothing can compare with Marbella or Puerto Ban s where dozens of attractive harborfront boutiques offer a stunning selection of merchandise at equally stunning prices You can make a considerable saving on luxury goods like jewelry watches perfumes and Havana cigars in duty free Gibraltar where the dreaded VAT does not exist Ceuta the Spanish protectorate on the North African coast has special tax status and alcohol for example is vastly cheaper there than mainland Spain The same applies to electrical goods etc but these will not seem like much of a bargain for Americans What to Buy Traditional Spanish handicrafts are high on any souvenir hunter s shopping list Ceramics Everyday glazed terracotta pottery can be bought all along the coast There s also a wide selection of tiles azulejos vases bowls and jugs with floral or geometric decorations in bright colors Foodstuffs Take home a taste of Spain with some olives olive oil almonds cheese or mouthwatering candies and cookies Jewelry Silver rings bracelets and necklaces in modern designs make good buys as do the artificial Majorica pearls of Spain Look too for fine filigree jewelry from C rdoba and smooth polished olive wood beads Leather and Suede Choose from a wide selection of handbags belts wallets trousers skirts and coats Leather goods while no longer the bargain they once were compare favorably in price with Italian and French made articles and the local factories do turn out stylish high quality leather clothing C rdoba which has been producing leather goods since Roman times is famous for its embossed leather Beware though many of the leather goods you will see have been imported from Morocco and are sold at vastly inflated prices It s actually cheaper and much more interesting to take a day trip to Tangier and buy such goods there Souvenirs Often delightfully tacky from plastic castanets and flamenco dolls to imitation wineskins and even bullfight posters printed with your own name Wine and Spirits Sweet M laga wine sherry brandy and Spanish wines provide some of the best bargains in Spain and are generally cheaper when bought in a supermarket than at the last minute at the duty free shop in the airport Entertainment Tour operators offer any number of excursions some more esoteric than others with brochures and booking facilities available through your hotel or a local travel agent Another form of organized entertainment amusement parks are discussed below in the section for families with young children Bullfights Andaluc a is famed for its bullfighting traditions and has two Sevilla and C rdoba of the seven first class Plaza de Toros bullrings in Spain The provincial capitals of Almer a Granada Huelva Ja n and M laga as well as Algeciras and El Puerto de Santa Mar a are second class rings All others including those of the resort towns along the Costa del Sol come into the third class category The two main events are a Corrida de Toros where fully qualified matadors fight fully grown at least 4 year old toros bulls and Novilladas where novilleros novice matadors fight novillos immature bulls As a rule of thumb the better events are held in the better plazas particularly during the fer as holiday fairs held in the major cities Equally true is the fact that most of the events held in the resort towns are mainly for the benefit of tourists and are of lesser quality They are not generally less expensive though small rings mean fewer seats which often equates to higher prices Contrary to popular opinion bullfights are not held every Sunday in each city In fact outside of the fer as when they are held daily only Sevilla has them on a regular basis throughout the season In other places with the exception of Easter Sunday and August 15 important national holidays they are held sporadically and advertised by way of the ubiquitous carteles posters stuck on every wall Be warned though these events are never less than bloody and can be much worse They are however enthralling spectacles and whatever your reaction you ll gain a valuable insight into the country and the people Flamenco All the coastal resorts offer flamenco shows for tourists These shows can be entertaining but the performances are more show business than the true spirit of flamenco To experience flamenco at its most authentic you will have to search out bars and small clubs in M laga or Sevilla Ask the local tourist office for advice on where to go Flamenco is an ancient art form combining elements of Visigothic Moorish and gypsy music There are two distinct types the cante jondo deep song an intense outpouring of emotion and the animated cante chico light song There are also different varieties of flamenco dance the tango fandango farruca and zambra performed to the staccato rhythms and counter rhythms of the castanets hand clapping palmadas and finger snapping pitos as well as furious heel drumming zapateado There is no need to speak Spanish to enjoy the spectacle you simply have to feel the music Discotheques and Nightclubs Some discos open as early as 9pm but most don t gear up for business until 11pm or midnight They close late too around 4am or even later Nightclubs salas de fiesta usually stage two shows an evening one at about midnight or 1am and the other around 3am Depending on the club the show may feature flamenco performances drag acts or shows with semi nude women Bars pubs and clubs often provide musical entertainment Casinos Two gambling establishments operate from 8pm to the early hours the Casino Torrequebrada in Benalm dena Costa and the Casino Marbella under the Hotel Andaluc a Plaza in Puerto Ban s In addition to the usual games the casinos have a bar restaurant and nightclub on the premises Formal dress jacket and tie for gentlemen is required Don t forget to bring your passport along for identification Concerts From May to October T voli World brings the stars of rock and pop to Torremolinos for concerts in the open air The season s program may include performances of flamenco and zarzuela Spanish light opera In winter M laga s symphony orchestra performs in the Teatro Cervantes theater and guest artists appear at Castillo El Bil Bil in Benalm dena Costa Children on the Costa del Sol The Costa del Sol is an ideal place for vacationing families with kids it is after all one long beach Apart from paddling and sandcastles older children can learn how to sail waterski or windsurf If you don t feel happy about letting your children play in the sea especially the younger ones the water parks at Mijas Torremolinos and Estepona offer a safer and more controlled environment where it s easier to keep a close eye on them Alternative diversions for children include the aquariums in Benalm dena and Puerto Ban s the Eagle Park in Benalm dena the Cueva cave De Nerja and Mini Hollywood near Almer a In the evenings T voli World near Benalm dena provides all the fun of the fair with carnival rides and a roller coaster and there s also a bar and flamenco show for the grown ups The Crocodile Park just north of M laga will intrigue most children as will the horse shows of El Ranchito in Benalm dena and Aires del Sur in Estepona When you re on the beach don t forget that kids are especially vulnerable to the effects of too much sun Take along plenty of high factor sunscreen and sun hats and make sure they re covered up during the middle of the day a siesta during the hottest part of the day may be a good idea to avoid sunburn
