 Background Macrophage migration inhibitory factor MIF is a proinflammatory cytokine that may play a role in several disease states including arthritis sepsis Crohn s disease allograft rejection asthma and prostate cancer 1 2 3 Although MIF was initially described as released from activated T cells 4 5 subsequent investigations have localized MIF in a variety of other cells and tissues for a recent review 1 For example pre formed MIF stores can be found in the epithelia of several organs and may be released in response to endotoxemia 6 The role of MIF in the central nervous system remains to be determined yet neurons in the brain synthesize and rapidly release MIF while glial cells appear to store MIF 7 8 and the anterior pituitary gland contains MIF that may be released during endotoxemia 9 Recent evidence from our laboratory showed that MIF is located in the bladder of the rat and also in peripheral ganglia innervating the bladder and other pelvic viscera The urothelium contains a rich store of pre formed MIF 10 11 Moreover MIF protein and mRNA were also detected by Western blotting techniques and RT PCR in the major pelvic ganglia MPG that provides efferent parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation to the bladder and other pelvic viscera 12 13 In addition the L6 S1 dorsal root ganglia DRG that provide afferent innervation to the bladder 13 and other pelvic viscera constitutively expressed MIF Finally the lumbosacral spinal cord of the rat where afferent and efferent information is integrated to result in effective pelvic viscera function 14 was also shown to contain MIF protein and mRNA Acute bladder inflammation induced by local intravesical administration of chemical irritants or lipopolysaccharide altered the levels of this cytokine in the bladder suggesting that MIF may be implicated in the early stages of bladder inflammation 10 11 In addition there were changes in the levels of MIF and cyclooxygenase 2 in the central and peripheral nervous tissues that innervate the bladder and other pelvic viscera Therefore in addition to the local inflammatory effect MIF may also be involved in neurogenically mediated changes at both central and peripheral nervous system sites following visceral inflammation Our previous studies reported the anatomical localization for MIF only in the bladder while the location of MIF in the peripheral ganglia MPG DRG and in the lumbosacral spinal cord was not determined since the focus was on the change in MIF amounts in these tissues following bladder inflammation 10 11 Therefore as part of our ongoing investigations on the role of MIF in pelvic viscera inflammation we investigated the location of MIF in two pelvic organs bladder and prostate and in peripheral ganglia that innervate these viscera using immunohistochemistry We examined the major pelvic ganglia where the parasympathetic and sympathetic neurons that innervate the bladder and the prostate are located Also we investigated the inferior mesenteric ganglia and the lumbar sympathetic chain that provide sympathetic innervation to the bladder and other pelvic viscera 13 We also determined the location of MIF in the L6 S1 dorsal root ganglia that provide afferent innervation to these organs Finally we localized MIF within the lumbosacral spinal cord since the spinal cord integrates afferent and efferent information from the pelvic viscera 14 Results MIF in the bladder and the prostate Intense MIF immunoreactivity in the urothelium was observed in the bladders of both male and female rats confirming our previous observations 11 The staining was most intense in the basal and intermediate layers of the urothelium Fig 1A 1B The superficial layer of the urothelium showed slight MIF immunostaining but also showed areas that appeared clear of MIF staining Fig 1B In addition the fibroblasts in the lamina propria immediately under the urothelium also showed MIF immunoreactivity Fig 1B Finally MIF immunoreactivity was also observed in the smooth muscle in the bladder confirming our previous findings Some nuclei in smooth muscle fibers appeared to stain with MIF and weak diffuse staining was also observed in the cytoplasm of smooth muscle fiber cells Fig 1C In the prostate MIF immunostaining was observed in the acini Fig 1D 1E 1F with the majority of the MIF staining localized to acinar epithelial cells Occasionally proximal acini following the classification of Lee et al 15 could be observed in some sections Fig 1D 1E Proximal acini could be distinguished from peripheral and central acini by the cuboidal as opposed to columnar epithelial cells and by the presence of surrounding smooth muscle layers The MIF staining in the proximal acini was more intense than in the central acini where the MIF staining was limited to basal epithelial cells Fig 1F No immunofluorescence was observed in tissue sections exposed to preabsorbed antisera or where the primary antiserum had been omitted data not shown The concentration of MIF in the bladder and the prostate was also determined using ELISA and expressed as ng of MIF protein mg of total protein In male rats the bladder had a mean MIF protein concentration of 200 8 5 75 ng mg whereas in the female bladder the MIF protein concentration was 67 3 13 ng mg This difference was statistically significant p 0 05 The MIF protein concentration in the ventral lobe of the prostate was 144 1 28 65 ng mg MIF in the Major Pelvic Ganglia Inferior Mesenteric Ganglia and Sympathetic Chain MIF staining was observed in cells of the MPG of both males and female rats The staining intensity varied with some cells showing intense staining Fig 2A and most cells showing moderate to weak staining Some of the more intensely stained MIF containing cells also stained for TH Fig 2B Thus MIF staining was observed in sympathetic and parasympathetic cells of the MPG Neurons in the inferior mesenteric ganglia also displayed MIF immunofluorescence Cells showing immunofluorescence for both MIF and TH were also observed Fig 2C 2D However the MIF staining in the inferior mesenteric ganglion appeared less intense overall than in the MPG Small intensely fluorescent SIF cells intensely stained with TH showed little to moderate MIF staining in the IMG Fig 2C and MPG Finally nearly every cell in the sympathetic chain showed some degree of MIF immunoreactivity More intensely staining cells could be located that also stained for TH Fig 2E 2F MIF in the dorsal root ganglia MIF immunoreactivity was observed over most of the neurons in the L6 S1 DRG of rats of either sex Some cells appeared intensely stained Fig 2G and some of these intensely stained MIF containing neurons also stained for substance P Fig 2H Many of the DRG neurons showed weak MIF immunostaining The satellite cells surrounding the DRG neurons however were intensely stained for MIF Control sections that were exposed to both the MIF blocking peptide and the antiserum or those that did not receive primary antiserum to MIF did not show any immunoreactivity data not shown Furthermore in sections where one of the antisera either MIF or TH SP had been omitted but still processed for double immunofluorescence only the appropriate immunoreactivity was observed indicating that the secondary antibodies were not cross reacting to produce spurious labeling data not shown MIF in the lumbosacral spinal cord In the L6 S1 spinal cord many cells were immunostained with MIF antisera Intensely stained cells were observed throughout the white matter Fig 3A In addition some intensely stained and some weakly stained cells were observed in the dorsal horn Fig 3B The dorsal horn also showed diffuse staining that could not be associated with particular cells but was limited to the dorsal horn and did not extent to the intermediate grey matter Fig 3B In the intermediate gray matter weakly staining MIF positive cells were located in the region around the central canal and in the IML region Fig 3C 3D The ventral horns and particularly the motor neurons were devoid of MIF immunostaining data not shown In order to establish if the MIF stained cells were neurons or glia we employed double immunofluorescence with MIF and GFAP All the MIF staining cells in the white matter also showed GFAP staining Fig 4A as would be expected In the dorsal horn although the great majority of the MIF cells also localized GFAP indicating they were glial in origin some cells also showed only MIF staining without GFAP suggesting that MIF could also be localized in neurons Fig 4B 4C In the IML region only double labeled cells were observed suggesting that only glial cells containing MIF were detected in the IML region Fig 4D Discussion Results in the present study revealed the location of MIF protein in the bladder and prostate of the rat and in the central and peripheral nervous system tissues that innervate these organs MIF was localized mainly to epithelia of the bladder and the prostate In the bladder a relatively strong MIF staining was observed in the basal and intermediate layers of the urothelium of male and female rats confirming and extending our recent findings in male rats 10 11 The superficial layer of the urothelium on the other hand contained relatively weak staining and areas devoid of MIF staining were often encountered A similar pattern of MIF immunostaining was described for human epidermis with the basal layer displaying strong MIF staining and weaker staining in the more superficial layers 16 MIF staining was also observed in the acini of the ventral lobe of the prostate In the central acini the labeling was limited to basal epithelial cells while columnar epithelial cells appeared devoid of MIF immunofluorescence Proximal acini however showed intense staining in the cuboidal epithelia These differences in epithelial MIF staining within the bladder and the prostate suggest a change in MIF synthesis as epithelia undergo differentiation as has been reported for the eye lens 17 Basal cells in the urothelium undergo proliferation to give rise to the intermediate and superficial layers 18 and MIF expression was correlated with cell differentiation in the lens 17 Therefore it is possible that MIF is involved in cell differentiation in the urothelium and in other organs as suggested by earlier investigations 16 17 Alternatively since the present study did not visualize MIF mRNA using in situ hybridization it is possible that cells in the superficial layer of the urothelium synthesize MIF but release it more quickly than deeper epithelial cells In addition to the epithelial staining we also observed significant MIF staining in the bladder smooth muscle cells with some fibers showing both cytoplasmic and nuclear staining Weak MIF staining of the smooth muscle fibers around proximal acini was also observed Other investigators have also reported MIF immunostaining in smooth muscle 6 19 Fibroblasts in the lamina propia of the bladder were also stained for MIF We observed a difference in the total bladder MIF protein content between male and female rats with male rats having considerably more MIF protein We were unable to locate reports of sex differences in MIF content in the literature These preliminary findings are interesting but the physiological significance if any remains unclear at this point Previously MIF was described in the epithelia of several organs of the rat 6 The present findings provide anatomical evidence of MIF protein in the bladder and prostate epithelia of the rat and confirm our earlier findings demonstrating MIF expression in the bladder by immunohistochemistry Western blotting analysis and RT PCR 10 11 In other organs the MIF stored in the epithelia was released upon endotoxemia 7 As such MIF may form part of the innate immune response of different organs to bacterial infection The exact role of MIF in the bladder and or the prostate of the rat is under investigation Previously we had shown that a chemical cystitis model intravesical hydrochloric acid decreased the overall MIF protein content in the bladder This effect was likely due to epithelial denudation However histological evidence showed increased MIF staining over smooth muscle fiber bundles perhaps indicating a role for MIF in the early stages of inflammation Furthermore intravesical LPS another commonly used cystitis model in rodents actually increased total bladder MIF protein and mRNA content 10 Therefore it is possible that MIF may be involved in the early responses of the bladder to inflammatory stimuli Interestingly the MIF protein content in the prostate actually decreased after intravesical LPS unpublished observations These findings although preliminary suggest to us that MIF may be released from prostate epithelia because of inflammatory events in other pelvic viscera in this case the bladder and this release may be mediated by neurogenic reflexes If this is indeed the case then MIF may play a role in neurogenic inflammation and in visceral referred pain In humans MIF protein has been localized in the prostate of cancer patients 2 In fact MIF may serve as a prognostic marker for prostate cancer since serum levels correlate with disease progression 3 Therefore MIF may represent an important target for therapeutic intervention in bladder and prostate inflammation and cancer The anatomical location of MIF mRNA and protein has been described for the adult rat brain 7 8 20 However the spinal cord and peripheral nervous systems have received less attention 21 22 In addition to the bladder and the prostate MIF appeared to be ubiquitous in neurons of the peripheral ganglia of the rat Weak to moderate MIF immunostaining was observed in the neurons of the MPG The major pelvic ganglia contain cholinergic and sympathetic neurons that innervate the bladder prostate colon and other pelvic viscera 12 MIF immunostaining was localized in both parasympathetic TH negative and sympathetic TH positive cells in the MPG In addition the SIF also TH positive cells also contained MIF These findings provide anatomical localization for our previous report of constitutive expression of MIF in the MPG previously 10 11 Finally sympathetic neurons TH positive in the inferior mesenteric ganglia and in the lumbar sympathetic chain also contained MIF The lumbar sympathetic chain contains a large proportion of the sympathetic post ganglionic neurons that innervate the bladder while the inferior mesenteric ganglion provides a much smaller contribution 12 Although not directly tested in the present experiment it is possible that some of the post ganglionic neurons that also stained with MIF innervate the bladder and or other pelvic viscera We also observed many L6 S1 DRG neurons that contained MIF as well as intensely stained satellite cells Some DRG neurons that were immunostained for MIF also co contained the neurotransmitter substance P Our findings of MIF in DRG neurons confirm earlier observations in the embryonic mouse 19 However our findings of MIF protein in afferent neurons in the DRG that also contain substance P represent a novel finding in the adult rat Finally we observed substantial MIF immunostaining in the lumbosacral spinal cord of the rat Glial cells GFAP positive in the white matter and in the gray matter were intensely immunostained for MIF Earlier investigations also reported MIF immunostaining in the white matter of the spinal cord 21 However we also observed cells in the dorsal horn that stained for MIF but not for GFAP suggesting they were neuronal rather than glial cells In the brain MIF immunohistochemistry is found strongly in glial cells with neurons displaying weak or no staining 7 Therefore neurons in the brain appear to synthesize MIF and quickly release it so that nearby glial cells accumulate MIF protein without synthesizing it It is possible that such a mechanism is at work at the level of the spinal cord In addition to cellular labeling with MIF we also observed terminal like labeling over the dorsal horn of the lumbosacral spinal cord This labeling was seen as a band of MIF immunostaining that was darker in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn than in the deeper intermediate gray matter This pattern of labeling is suggestive of the terminal fields of afferent neurotransmitters and corroborates previous reports of MIF terminal labeling in the brain 7 However the staining was diffuse and individual nerve fibers such as is the case with afferent neurotransmitter immunohistochemistry for example substance P were not identified Therefore more work needs to be done to document whether the MIF staining over the dorsal horn represents afferent terminal labeling or diffuse glial labeling MIF is a pro inflammatory cytokine that may play a crucial role in initiating or maintaining several inflammatory conditions 1 In experimental models treatment with antibodies to MIF reversed or prevented colitis and gastric ulcer formation 23 24 MIF is upregulated in neurons in the brain and released into the CSF following intracisternal LPS or spinal cord injury 7 21 In addition MIF is upregulated in the brain after reperfusion subsequent to ischemia 25 Therefore MIF is likely involved in the brain s response infectious agents or trauma Conclusions Results from the present study establish that MIF protein is located in epithelia and smooth muscle in two pelvic organs the bladder and the prostate Furthermore post ganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic and afferent neurons also contain MIF protein Finally astrocytes and neurons in the lumbosacral spinal cord contain MIF The role of MIF in the integration of pelvic viscera function is still under investigation We have recently showed MIF upregulation in the bladder in the L6 S1 DRG and in the lumbosacral cord after induction of acute bladder inflammation using two different models 10 11 The upregulation of MIF in central and peripheral nervous tissues following localized i e bladder inflammation raises the interesting possibility that MIF may contribute to central and peripheral neurogenic events mediating inflammation Although cytokines are traditionally associated with peripheral immune reactions as part of the innate response evidence is accumulating that they may also be involved in normal brain function and may mediate pathological responses such as hyperalgesia 26 27 In fact the abundance of MIF in glia of the spinal cord is particularly interesting since glial cells have been suggested as involved in hyperalgesia through the release of cytokines and other substances 28 Given the presence of MIF in the pelvic organs bladder prostate and the central and peripheral nervous system tissues that innervate these organs as well as the fact that bladder inflammation appears to upregulate MIF in these areas it is possible that MIF represents a therapeutic target in reducing or preventing pelvic viscera inflammation Methods Perfusion and tissue collection Six n 6 adult Sprague Dawley Harlan IN rats were
