 Introduction Recombinant human interleukin 11 rhIL 11 is a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates the growth and development of hematopoietic stem cells and decreases the proinflammatory mediators of cytokine and nitric oxide production 1 Treatment with rhIL 11 decreases the production of proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor TNF and interleukin IL 1 and inhibits NF B binding activity 2 3 4 In animal models both of collagen induced and adjuvant induced arthritis rhIL 11 reduced both the level of synovitis and the histologic lesion score in the joints 5 Rheumatoid arthritis RA is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology Its worldwide prevalence is approximately 1 6 There appears to be no single therapeutic regimen or combination of therapies that has consistently been associated with sustained improvement i e remission 7 A number of disease modifying drugs e g methotrexate are available to treat RA but are limited by significant toxicity requiring adjunct therapy or are of variable efficacy There are currently a number of anticytokine and other immune modulating therapies in clinical trials 8 The proinflammatory cytokine TNF has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of RA 9 10 Etanercept sTNFR Fc and infliximab chimeric anti TNF monoclonal antibody have been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of patients with RA for whom treatment with at least one disease modifying antirheumatic drug had previously failed 11 12 both of these biologicals have been approved by regulatory agencies for the treatment of patients with RA rhIL 11 has previously been assessed in a Phase I II masked placebo controlled trial in patients with active Crohn s disease The data suggested clinical benefit as assessed from the mean change from baseline in the Crohn s Disease Severity Index after 21 days at doses of 16 and 40 g kg per week P 0 05 The researchers concluded that rhIL 11 was safe at the doses and schedules used and had a therapeutic effect 13 14 The findings supported the initiation of a phase I II clinical trial in patients with RA Materials and Methods Patients Men and women at least 18 years of age were eligible to participate if they had met the American College of Rheumatology ACR criteria for RA for at least one year and were in functional Class I II or III 15 All patients had to have had at least one failed trial of a disease modifying antirheumatic drug DMARD and had to have at least 10 painful and 10 swollen joints at entry No DMARD therapy was allowed within 4 weeks of randomization Patients receiving nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs corticosteroids 10 mg per day or both were allowed in the trial if they had been on stable doses for at least four weeks before randomization Required baseline laboratory values included serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen 1 5 the upper limit of normal and alanine aminotranferase and aspartate aminotransferase 2 0 the upper limit of normal Exclusionary laboratory values included a platelet count of 500 000 mm 3 hematocrit 30 and a white blood cell count 3000 mm 3 Other exclusionary criteria included use of intravenous or intra articular corticosteroids within four weeks of randomization any prior use of cyclosporine or cyclophosphamide use of any investigational agent within 30 days of randomization severe extra articular manifestations of RA acute infection requiring antibiotic therapy within two weeks of randomization other autoimmune disease e g systemic lupus erythematosus or any other condition that the investigator thought might have placed the patient at undue risk if they had participated in the trial Men and women of childbearing potential were required to use approved methods of birth control Women had to have a negative result on a test of serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin at screening Medications including cyclosporine cyclophosphamide and any DMARD were not allowed The use of intravenous or intra articular corticosteroids was not permitted The following analgesics were permitted acetaminophen acetaminophen with codeine acetaminophen with oxycodone and propoxyphene Patients were instructed not to take analgesics within 12 hours of their planned study visit Study protocol An Institutional Review Board approved the protocol at each of the 12 participating centers Patients gave prior written informed consent to any study related procedures Within 14 days before randomization patients had a complete medical history taken and a complete physical examination A standard hematology profile was prepared including white blood cell count with differential count and a serum chemistry profile was prepared consisting of sodium potassium chloride blood urea nitrogen creatinine glucose phosphorus total bilirubin alkaline phosphatase aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase albumin uric acid total protein C reactive protein CRP fibrinogen and a microscopic urinalysis An additional serum specimen was taken on days 1 28 84 and 112 to measure for the presence of IL 6 Screening clinical assessments included vital signs counts of tender and swollen joints the patient s global assessment and assessment of their pain and a physician s global assessment using a 7 point Likert scale 0 none or good to 7 severe or very bad Rheumatoid factor was also measured A serum pregnancy test was done in all female patients of childbearing potential Disease activity and clinical laboratory values were assessed again on day 1 and then every 2 weeks for 12 weeks and at 4 weeks post dosing Day 1 procedures were performed before the first dose of study drug was administered Rheumatologists or trained study coordinators performed clinical assessments To minimize variability the same person assessed disease activity during the trial whenever possible Patients could withdraw from the trial at any time for any of the following reasons at the patient s request if a serious adverse event occurred if a concomitant medication not permitted by the protocol was required or if a patient became pregnant did not comply with study related procedures or needed surgery Treatment Twelve centers randomized patients using a central randomization to one of five treatment groups placebo 2 5 or 7 5 g kg of rhIL 11 twice per week or 5 0 or 15 g kg of rhIL 11 given subcutaneously once per week The maximum dose in any single injection was 1000 g The study coordinator taught patients how to administer the study drug subcutaneously themselves Either rhIL 11 or a placebo saline was supplied as 1 mg lyophilized powder in a phosphate glycine formulation and reconstituted with 1 ml water for injection Statistical analysis The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of rhIL 11 given to patients with active RA The safety endpoints were the incidence and severity of reported adverse events and abnormal laboratory findings Adverse events are reported without regard to causality and are described for the study as a whole and by treatment group Descriptive statistics summarizing the incidence and severity of adverse events are presented The secondary objective of this trial was to evaluate and characterize the clinical activity of rhIL 11 The endpoint used to characterize clinical activity was the proportion of patients whose disease improved according to the 20 ACR criteria 16 The overall proportion of patients whose disease improved within each individual category of the ACR criteria is also presented Exploratory comparative tests on differences in the proportions of improvement between the rhIL 11 treated groups and the placebo group were done using a two sided Fisher s exact test Logistic regression was used to explore the effect of total weekly dose dosing schedule treatment duration and outcome on clinical activity Missing data were handled by both the ad hoc last observation carried forward method and the worst case scenario method In the last observation carried forward approach when an observation for a 12 week time point was lacking for a patient the last available observed value was carried forward In the worst case scenario approach dropouts were treated as failures The sample size was based on an assumed 10 placebo success rate The sample size had a 80 power to detect a 0 51 difference from the placebo success rate in at least one of the rhIL 11 treatment groups at the 0 05 level of significance Results Characteristics of patients The pretherapy characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 1 Sixty seven women and 24 men were randomized to the study and 90 patients received at least one dose of study drug One patient was randomized but never received the study drug as they withdrew consent prior to treatment The mean age of all patients was 51 years range 21 83 and the mean time since diagnosis was 12 6 years range 1 2 40 3 No significant differences between the pretherapy characteristics of men and women were noted The mean numbers of tender and swollen joints in all patients at screening were 27 and 20 respectively Forty nine of the 90 patients 54 4 who were dosed completed 12 weeks of dosing The majority of patients 24 of 41 or 58 5 who discontinued early withdrew due to lack of clinical effect Eleven patients 12 2 withdrew because of adverse events Of the remaining six patients four withdrew their consent one was lost to follow up and one received a prohibited medication Patients who discontinued from the trial were evenly distributed among all the treatment groups Safety rhIL 11 was well tolerated No dose limiting toxicities were observed In the 11 patients who withdrew because of an adverse event none of these events were considered to be drug related One patient died during the study from complications associated with a spontaneous pneumothorax this patient was in the placebo group The only adverse events clearly related to rhIL 11 were reactions at the injection site which were seen in 60 6 43 of 71 of patients who received rhIL 11 and none of the 19 placebo recipients The incidence of injection site reactions was not related to any dose or schedule These reactions erythema or erythema with induration were mild and resolved within days after the study drug was discontinued There were no statistically significant differences in the incidences of respiratory infections non respiratory infections or edema A higher incidence of infection in the rhIL 11 treated group 7 8 than in the placebo group 0 was not statistically significant P 0 34 Clinical trials with other agents that affect levels of circulating TNF have also found more frequent nonstatistical differences in the incidence of upper respiratory infections 11 Adverse events occurring in more than 5 of patients are summarized in Table 2 No significant changes in hematology or chemistry parameters were noted during the study There were no statistically significant changes in fibrinogen levels or platelet counts in rhIL 11 treated patients compared with placebo during the study at all doses and schedules Disease activity No clear therapeutic effect associated with the administration of rhIL 11 was observed Figure 1describes the data using the 20 ACR criteria for response at the various doses or schedules tested The placebo response rate at the 20 improvement criteria was unusually high 32 for a placebo controlled trial Several 6 19 patients in the placebo group experienced a significant 50 improvement in their tender and swollen joint counts during the study These findings in the placebo group obscure any comparative rhIL 11 benefit Values for placebo treated patients regressed towards baseline during the follow up period in all analyses performed The group treated with rhIL 11 at 15 g kg once per week produced a statistically significant improvement in tender joint counts P 0 007 at 12 weeks Figure 1 The mean percentage of improvement in the tender joint count at this dose and schedule was 31 8 Figure 2 This trend was consistent when an intent to treat ITT analysis was used to evaluate changes from baseline in tender joint count in all rhIL 11 treated cohorts P 0 015 There is no obvious reason why an improvement in tender joint count were not mirrored by changes in other clinical measurements Comparative assessment unadjusted for multiple comparisons at the end of treatment time point revealed statistically significant correlations between serum levels of IL 6 and CRP to each of the six clinical outcomes tender joint count swollen joint count patient s global assessment patient s assessment of pain physician s global assessment score on health assessment questionnaire Correlation coefficients were moderate r 0 24 0 42 and all corresponding unadjusted P values were less than 0 03 These were tender joint count versus IL 6 P 0 003 swollen joint count versus IL 6 P 0 026 tender joint count versus CRP P 0 001 swollen joint count versus CRP P 0 002 P values of comparisons between the other four clinical assessments and IL 6 CRP were stronger with all 0 001 Discussion In this study no therapeutic benefit of rhIL 11 at the doses and frequencies of administration studied was found Some individual measurements of therapeutic effect tender joint counts and biologic activity IL 6 levels were observed rhIL 11 was well tolerated at all doses Except for the tender joint count none of the observed disease activities was statistically different from placebo according to the ACR criteria at the 20 improvement level The inability of rhIL 11 to bring about a statistically significant improvement in the ACR 20 criteria may also be the result of an inability of rhIL 11 to stimulate the synthesis of acute phase proteins of the significant clinical response of several placebo treated patients or of a lack of adequate power of the study to show efficacy Larger clinical trails of rhIL 11 at higher or more frequent dosing intervals and for a longer dosing period may provide more definitive data on the safety and efficacy of rhIL 11 in the treatment of patients with RA The mechanism of action of rhIL 11 in the treatment of active RA most likely results from the ability of rhIL 11 to reduce levels of TNF IL 1 and IL 12 p40 The anti inflammatory activity of rhIL 11 is mediated in part by inhibition of NF B dependent transcriptional activation of proinflammatory cytokine genes The ability of rhIL 11 to affect levels of IL 6 is also probably mediated through this mechanism An analysis of pharmacodynamic markers in skin biopsies obtained from patients with moderate psoriasis treated with rhIL 11 revealed lower levels of INF TNF and inducible nitric oxide than before treatment Conclusion These preliminary data suggest that rhIL 11 may be safely administered to patients with active RA at a variety of doses and schedules No dose limiting adverse event was observed The dose of 15 g kg of rhIL 11 once per week suggested a minimal therapeutic effect an improvement in tender joint counts Further studies are warranted to find out if higher or more frequent doses of rhIL 11 may be safe and efficacious in treating RA Abbreviations ACR American College of Rheumatology CRP C reactive protein DMARD disease modifying
