                     OK tell me about whenever you broke your jaw                     Im about to have to rig it                  I was in high school and one day I was helping my father outside put a window in replacing a window on the garage door         I had previously broke the window by throwing a baseball through it on by accident         Well we was replacing this window and we got it fixed and my dad was like Lets go for a little bike ride         It was probably about  in the evening you know right before mom had supper ready so we went for a quick bike ride         We got on the bikes and went down the road a little piece and finally my dad said OK Ill race you back back to the uh house you wuss         I said All right         So uh          I passed my dad I passed him and about that time my brakes I dont know what happened my front brakes got went in the spokes somehow and it it made me uh it flipped me in the air about one and a half times and I got we had toe clips on our bikes and finally finally my feet came out of my toe clips and my chin hit the pavement and                     Were you near your house                     Yeah kind of                     Sort of                     We was close by         It was probably it was over we was half mile from my house         But uh my chin hit the pavement and as soon as it hit I felt I felt something crack right here and I just laid there on the road kind of shocked and my dad was like Kevin         Kevin         you know came up to me and was like uh Oh crap you know                  And he said a few words and he didnt want to move me because he he saw the way I fell and thought maybe Id broke some ribs or something and he didnt want to move me         So I am laying here in the middle of the road and he kept asking if I am all right and I was like Yeah Im all right because I knew something was wrong with me and I hate hospitals and and I dont want to go to a hospital if something happens to me         But uh I was like Im all right         Well he picked me up and put me on the side of the road and he raced back to the house                              He left you on the side of the road                     He had to                     I know                     So he raced back to the house to get my mom and get the car         Well they came and got me and took me back to the house and my mom I I was shaking and stuff my mom was afraid I was going in shock so she put a blanket around me and she was like Kevin are you OK         and I was like Yeah Im OK Mom         I dont need to go to the hospital or anything like that I am fine         And she goes OK open your mouth for me         So I opened my mouth and I couldnt get it I couldnt shut it back                     You had to go to the hospital like that                              Yeah         She was like she was like OK you got to go to the hospital         So I started going nuts                  Well I get to the hospital and they had to put me in this wheelchair and they rolled me in because I couldnt walk         I was just so weak from I dont know I guess what was just happening                     From the flipping                     Yeah and um I rolled in there and they was like Oh man was you in a bad car accident                  And because I looked horrible I mean my chin was bleeding because I busted my chin and I just looked bad and they my dad was like Nah he was in a bicycle accident                              Just flipped his bike                     So they took me to the hospital room and Im going nuts people are having to hold me down while they pull as asphalt out of my chin                     Oh gross                     Because my chin hurt so bad sewed me up         And         I dont know I never knew what was coming I I I never knew what they did when you broke a jaw                     Did they put you to sleep                     Nah well like that night they told me theyd let me go home and stuff from the hospital and my I mean my before I went to bed my dad was like Well you got to go see a specialist tomorrow and I was like Wh whats he going to do         and he was like Well hell just tell you youre going to have to you know eat mashed potatoes and stuff the whole time soup and thats it and I was like OK         Well that night I couldnt sleep at all because it felt like a brick wall a brick I mean a brick wall was on my head so much pressure was on my chin and stuff my jaw         So the next morning we go and it was Doctor Trevez I believe                     Thats who did my um         wisdom teeth                     Yeah                     I liked him                     Yeah I did too actually         Well Doctor Trevez was like Well we are going to have to wire your mouth shut and I had never heard of this         This freaked me out         Im a freshman in high school Im like What          and I I couldnt talk with it I was like Oh crap         So they had to put me to sleep they had to put a IV in my my arm and stuff         And         what scared me the most was when he said before he put the IV in my arm before he did say before he did surgery before he was going to do the surgery he said OK uh lets have a word of prayer                     Yeah I was like OK please                     I was like Wooh                     You thought you were going under                     So I so I did I never heard him finish the prayer though         I was I was out                     Umhuh                     Before he got done         And I woke up and my mouth was wired shut         I ra I ran around talking like this all the time         It was like                     Carla probably tortured you                     It was like wired shut for two months         That was probably the most awkward two months of my whole life because I because I had to drink all this stuff at school         I had to take Ensure and milkshakes with me to school         I couldnt eat regular food I had to slurp it up with a straw and I I had uh was having to drink all these liquids and stuff at least every thirty minutes to an hour so I wouldnt lose weight         They were afraid of me losing too much weight                     Uhhuh                     So uh I had to go through that in high school         And you know people started doing the Kevin Talk                     What what was that                     It was like this you know everybody started when they would walk by me in the hall they would  Whats up Kevin                              Oh my God                     And it was called the Kevin Talk                     Thats you Burns folks         Thats what yall do out there                     And ever since then every time I eat now my uh my left cheek starts to sweat                     It sweats                              Its got a little circle where it sweats when I eat because I it did nerve damage                     Oh                     To my jaw and stuff there was nerve damage so I sweat every time I eat there just a little circle of sweat                     So you sweat
