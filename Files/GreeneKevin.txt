previously broke the window by throwing a baseball through it on by accident Well we was replacing this window and we got it fixed and my dad was like Let s go for a little bike ride It was probably about 5 30 in the evening you know right before mom had supper ready so we went for a quick bike ride We got on the bikes and went down the road a little piece and finally my dad said OK I ll race you back back to the uh house you wuss I said All right So uh I passed my dad I passed him and about that time my brakes I don t know what happened my front brakes got went in the spokes somehow and it it made me uh it flipped me in the air about one and a half times and I got we had toe clips on our bikes and finally finally my feet came out of my toe clips and my chin hit the pavement and Were you near your house Yeah kind of Sort of We was close by It was probably it was over we was half mile from my house But uh my chin hit the pavement and as soon as it hit I felt I felt something crack right here and I just laid there on the road kind of shocked and my dad was like Kevin Kevin you know came up to me and was like uh Oh crap you know And he said a few words and he didn t want to move me because he he saw the way I fell and thought maybe I d broke some ribs or something and he didn t want to move me So I am laying here in the middle of the road and he kept asking if I am all right and I was like Yeah I m all right because I knew something was wrong with me and I hate hospitals and and I don t want to go to a hospital if something happens to me But uh I was like I m all right Well he picked me up and put me on the side of the road and he raced back to the house He left you on the side of the road He had to I know So he raced back to the house to get my mom and get the car Well they came and got me and took me back to the house and my mom I I was shaking and stuff my mom was afraid I was going in shock so she put a blanket around me and she was like Kevin are you OK and I was like Yeah I m OK Mom I don t need to go to the hospital or anything like that I am fine And she goes OK open your mouth for me So I opened my mouth and I couldn t get it I couldn t shut it back You had to go to the hospital like that Yeah She was like she was like OK you got to go to the hospital So I started going nuts Well I get to the hospital and they had to put me in this wheelchair and they rolled me in because I couldn t walk I was just so weak from I don t know I guess what was just happening From the flipping Yeah and um I rolled in there and they was like Oh man was you in a bad
