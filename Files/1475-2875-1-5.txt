 Background Reversible protein phosphorylation is gaining recognition as a potentially important mechanism of post translational regulation in protozoan parasites especially those belonging to the Apicomplexan family The dephosphorylation of phosphoproteins is universally catalyzed by protein phosphatases that are classified into two major functional groups protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP and protein serine threonine phosphatase PP although enzymes with various degrees of dual specificity are also encountered 1 2 3 4 5 The majority of Ser Thr phosphatases belong to three classical groups namely PP1 PP2A and PP2B calcineurin and possess similar primary structures in their catalytic cores 2 3 6 PP1 in particular exhibits an extremely high degree of sequence conservation through evolution and its orthologs and isoforms are found in all eukaryotic cells 6 7 In various organisms PP1 regulates such diverse cellular processes as cell cycle progression protein synthesis carbohydrate metabolism transcription and neuronal signaling 3 7 underscoring its profound importance in biology The PP1 and PP2A phosphatases are differentially affected by natural toxins such as okadaic acid OA and microcystin LR For example the characteristic IC 50 values for OA fall in the range PP2A 1 5 nM PP1 20 80 nM whereas PP2B is highly resistant to both 2 3 7 In contrast tautomycin affects PP1 and PP2A nearly equally but fails to inhibit other phosphatases 8 In the past few years a number of phosphatase activities and putative sequences have been reported in P falciparum 9 These include a PP2A 10 a PP2B like activity 10 a unique chimeric PP2C 11 two putative sexual stage phosphatases PP 12 and PP 13 and a tetratricopeptide repeat containing phosphatase PP5 14 Preliminary studies revealed the presence of a protein phosphatase activity in crude extracts of RBC grown P falciparum that exhibited toxin sensitivity resembling that of PP1 15 Uninfected RBC in contrast possessed mainly a PP2A like activity Because of its potential importance in a variety of signalling pathways of the parasite we have turned our attention to defining the PP1 phosphatase and its regulation in P falciparum In this communication we report the exact sequence of a PP1 cDNA in P falciparum the corresponding gene sequence in P falciparum chromosome 14 the enzymatic properties of the recombinant enzyme and its inhibition by mammalian physiological PP1 inhibitors namely inhibitor 1 I 1 and inhibitor 2 I 2 Post transcriptional gene silencing using synthetic short interfering RNA siRNA molecules has been recently used to ablate specific mRNAs and thus produce phenotypic mutations in specific genes 16 17 We have adopted this technology to knockdown specific gene products in RNA viruses that are obligatory intracellular parasites 18 In the present study we have successfully used a similar strategy to generate phenotypic PP1 deficient P falciparum parasites Results and Discussion Identification of the PfPP1 cDNA sequence Various pairs of oligodeoxynucleotide primers were designed on the basis of the PlasmoDB predicted mRNA sequence Gene chr14_1 phat_133 and employed in reverse transcription PCR RT PCR amplification using Pf3D7 total mRNA as template Based on the prediction primers 5 ATGGCATTAGAAATAGATATAGATAATG 3 primer A in Fig 1 the start codon in bold and 5 TTATTTCCGACAAAAAGAAATATATGG 3 were first tested but no product was obtained Since there was no other ATG within a reasonable distance upstream that was in the same reading frame we proceeded on the assumption that the 3 end of the mRNA might be different Thus the second primer was replaced by a series of nested primers based on the genomic sequence each of which was paired with primer A in RT PCR The combination of primer A and the primer 5 TTTTTTAATTTGCTGCTTTCTTTTTTTCC 3 Fig 1 eventually produced a RT PCR product that was cloned into pGEM T vector and sequenced The cDNA sequence contained a 915 nucleotide long open reading frame corresponding to a polypeptide 304 amino acid in length and ending with a TAA stop codon Comparison of the cDNA sequence with the genomic sequence in Chromosome 14 at TIGR revealed that the coding sequence is divided into five exons of which the first two are the largest and contain most of the catalytic core of the phosphatase Fig 1and 2 The intron sequences are pronouncedly more AT rich than exons and contained homopolymeric repeats a feature which in our experience is common in Plasmodium genes BLAST analysis of the predicted primary structure of the protein revealed its clear identity with the PP1 class Fig 2 It is to be mentioned that among all the Ser Thr phosphatases PP1 has been subjected to the most extensive structure function analysis 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 In fact it was one of the first phosphatases for which the three dimensional structure was solved 26 27 A representative alignment in Fig 2demonstrates the high sequence conservation between the human and Plasmodium PP1 sequences The catalytic core of all members of the PP1 and PP2 families are very conserved and roughly corresponds to residues 5 260 of PfPP1 Fig 2 This region contains all the signature motifs and conserved residues that have been shown to be important for the fundamental steps of catalysis including substrate binding metal ion coordination and interaction with the phosphate group 19 26 27 28 It is to be noted that at 304 amino acid residues PfPP1 is the shortest PP1 known to date and lacks a short proline rich stretch at the C terminal end Fig 2 Expression and catalytic properties of PfPP1 In order to characterize the PfPP1 cDNA we subcloned it into pET 15b such that the protein is expressed with an N terminal His 6 tag As shown in Fig 3 a protein band of approximately 37 000 Mr was produced from the pET 15b PfPP1 clone which is in agreement with the predicted molecular weight of 34 904 of PfPP1 and roughly another 2 000 added for the His 6 region of pET 15b Novagen Madison WI The protein specifically reacted with a monoclonal anti His antibody and also with a polyclonal antibody against full length human PP1 Transduction Laboratories Lexington KY The recombinant protein was purified through nickel chelation chromatography and tested for phosphatase activity It dephosphorylated the small substrate p NPP as well as histone labelled at Ser residues Interestingly it also showed decent activity on a Tyr phosphorylated synthetic peptide The V max values mol Pi liberated mg enzyme min against these three substrates pNPP phosphoserine histone phosphotyrosine peptide were respectively 12 2 8 1 and 2 0 5 An equivalent protein fraction obtained from E coli containing vector alone without insert showed no activity against any of these substrates It has been recently shown that rabbit PP1 expressed in E coli also possessed Tyr phosphatase activity In contrast native PP1 isolated from rabbit muscle or expressed in Sf9 insect cells contained only Ser Thr phosphatase activity but no Tyr phosphatase activity 24 It was concluded that this apparent difference might be due to subtle changes in protein folding in eukaryotic versus prokaryotic cellular environments It remains to be seen whether this is a general feature of all PP1 To obtain biochemical evidence for the identity of the recombinant PfPP1 we tested the effect of specific phosphatase inhibitors and selected mutations on the phosphatase activity Mutation of Asn122 to Asp by site directed mutagenesis destroyed the phosphatase activity confirming the essential role of this residue of PP1 in catalysis 19 PfPP1 was inhibited by NaF inorganic orthophosphate and pyrophosphate at respective IC 50 values of 2 5 mM 10 mM and 90 M data not shown Similar values were recently obtained for Arabidopsis PP1 8 PfPP1 was also inhibited by tautomycin I 1 I 2 and OA with IC 50 values of 0 8 400 7 and 100 nM respectively Fig 4 These values are comparable to those obtained with various PP1 isoforms recombinantly expressed in E coli 25 29 The sensitivity of PfPP1 to these natural toxins is consistent with the fact that the loop sequence between the 12 and 13 regions plays a direct role in binding these toxins 23 26 and this sequence is entirely conserved in PfPP1 Fig 2 Recently a few additional residues that are closer to the N terminus in the PP1 sequence have also been shown to be important in the interaction with I 2 24 in PfPP1 numbers these residues are E52 E54 and D164 E165 K166 Fig 2 In yeast PP1 Glc7p the double mutant E52A E54A and the triple mutant D164A E165A K166A showed IC 50 values for I 2 that were respectively 8 and 300 times the wild type enzyme values 24 As shown in Fig 4 a similar loss of inhibition by I 2 was also observed when the corresponding mutations were introduced into PfPP1 although they did not affect the catalytic activity specific activity data not shown Together these results provide experimental confirmation of the catalytic identity of PfPP1 Expression of native PfPP1 As mentioned earlier inhibition studies using OA and calyculin A suggested the existence of a PP1 like activity in P falciparum extracts 15 However our attempts to purify the native PfPP1 enzyme by chromatographic procedures resulted in only small amounts of activity probably due to rapid inactivation during fractionation To determine if PfPP1 is expressed in Plasmodium we have therefore taken an immunological approach First cell free extracts of different erythrocytic stages of P falciparum were subjected to Western blot using a monoclonal antibody that was raised against nearly full length human PP1 and showed a broad species specificity see Materials and Methods As shown in Fig 5A a major band of the expected size of 35 k was observed in all stages including gametes A peptide antibody specific for human PP1 Materials and Methods did not detect the band The gametogenesis was confirmed by the appearance of Pfg27 an early gamete specific protein 30 Having demonstrated that the monoclonal antibody was specific for PP1 we used it in an attempt to inhibit PfPP1 activity in vitro At optimal concentrations the antibody almost completely inhibited 90 inhibition recombinant PfPP1 including its Tyr phosphatase activity and also inhibited the phosphatase activity of the P falciparum extract by about 70 data not shown Under the same conditions the human specific antibody had no effect Finally it has been shown that affinity resins containing immobilized microcystin specifically bind toxin sensitive phosphatases such as PP1 and PP2A 31 Thus we passed soluble cytosolic Pf extract through microcystin Sepharose and the bound proteins were analyzed on SDS PAGE followed by immunoblot using the anti PP1 antibody The blot revealed that the 35 kDa PfPP1 polypeptide indeed specifically bound to microcystin Fig 5B correlating the antigenic reactivity of PfPP1 with its affinity for the toxin Pre incubation of the extract with microcystin specifically prevented binding of PfPP1 to the column Generation of phenotypic PfPP1 mutants by PTGS using RNAi RNA interference RNAi mediated by short interfering double stranded RNA molecules siRNA or dsRNA is now recognized as a major mechanism of post transcriptional gene silencing PTGS in essentially all eukaryotes 16 Recently the technique has been successfully applied to cultured mammalian cells whereby introduction of 21 nucleotide long synthetic dsRNA molecules corresponding to specific mRNA sequences effectively and specifically degraded the cognate mRNAs and abrogated the expression of the corresponding proteins 17 18 This prompted us to test a similar approach to knockdown PfPP1 function in the erythrocytic P falciparum stages Our initial attempts with standardized transfection procedures using OligofectAMINE Life Technologies Bethesda MD with the dsRNA did not produce an appreciable loss of PfPP1 We then resorted to the electroporation procedure originally developed for DNA transfection in Plasmodium by Wellems and co workers 32 as detailed under Materials and Methods A representative set of results shown in Fig 6clearly demonstrates loss of PfPP1 by the RNAi procedure while the control PP2A was not significantly affected Loss of PfPP1 resulted in concomitant inhibition of parasite growth as evidenced by the drastic reduction in 3H hypoxanthine incorporation These results suggest that PfPP1 plays an essential role in Plasmodium replication The facts that the parasite culture was asynchronous i e contained all three major stages ring trophozoite and schizont data not shown and that the effect of dsRNA was severe suggest that PfPP1 is required for cell cycle progression at all stages of the parasite This is further supported by the expression of PP1 protein in all the parasitic stages Fig 5 Taken together this is consistent with the established role of PP1 in eukaryotic DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression as discussed below PP1 is one of the major protein phosphatases found in all eukaryotic cells The activity of the catalytic subunit of PP1 is controlled by its interaction with a large number of regulatory subunits many of which also target it to specific subcellular compartments 7 24 33 The major ones include the glycogen targeting subunits G M G L 34 myofibrillar targeting subunit M 110 34 nuclear inhibitor of PP1 NIPP 1 35 PP1 nuclear targeting subunit PNUTS 36 37 mitosis regulating subunit Sds22 38 39 40 ribosomal protein L5 41 and small cytosolic inhibitory proteins I 1 I 2 and DARRP 32 Dopamine and cAMP regulated phosphoprotein Mr 32 000 7 23 25 The physiological role of many of these interactions has been revealed in recent studies A temperature sensitive mutant of the yeast PP1 Glc7 for example exhibits a block in the M phase of the cell division cycle and elevated expression of Sds22 suppresses this defect 38 Structure function analysis of recombinant mammalian PP1 has recently begun to map specific residues involved in interaction with other molecules Interestingly all these residues are conserved in PfPP1 and a few examples are presented here Co crystal structure of PP1 and a G M peptide 42 as well as mutagenesis studies 43 of the yeast PP1 ortholog Glc7 have demonstrated a role of specific PP1 residues in PP1 G M interaction In the PfPP1 sequence these residues are I167 L241 F255 L264 C289 and F291 Fig 2 As mentioned the 12 loop 13 region important in interaction with natural toxins 23 is fully conserved in PfPP1 Fig 2 Two residues recently shown to be important for interaction with DARPP 32 22 are also conserved in PfPP1 these are Met288 and Cys289 Fig 2 We have provided experimental evidence of an important role of a number of invariant residues of PfPP1 in the interaction with I 2 Fig 2and 4 Based on such overwhelming conservation of functionally important residues we propose that orthologs of many of these PP1 interacting proteins may also exist in Plasmodium and function in similar roles The use of recombinant PfPP1 and protein protein interaction techniques should aid in characterizing these physiological regulatory subunits of PfPP1 Our ability to generate PP1 deficient P falciparum parasites will allow us to study the mutant phenotype in further detail and understand the role of this highly conserved phosphatase in malarial biochemistry and pathophysiology These studies are in progress As mentioned earlier Li and Baker 12 described a putative phosphatase DNA sequence in Plasmodium the mRNA of which was detected in the sexual stages of the parasite The predicted protein named PP was 889 amino acid long and contained a unique N terminal extension of about 500 amino acids The C terminal 345 amino acids containing the putative catalytic domain had 5 unique peptide stretches that were called inserts When these inserts were omitted from the alignment the rest of the sequence showed significant similarity with PP1 phosphatases 12 Clearly further studies are needed to identify the PP protein and characterize its potentially interesting identity While our manuscript was being written McRobert and McConkey 44 achieved similar success in using the RNAi strategy to ablate dihydroorotate dehydrogenase DHODH of P falciparum Although the protein level was not directly monitored the loss of DHODH mRNA was confirmed by RT PCR This resulted in inhibition of parasite growth consistent with the role of DHODH in pyrimidine biosynthesis essential for parasite DNA replication These authors introduced the double stranded RNA by electroporation also using conditions very similar to ours Thus although the exact mechanism of the RNA uptake remains to be elucidated the electroporation procedure must have allowed the dsRNA to traverse the various erythrocytic and parasitic membranes to enter the parasitic cells The success in ablating PfPP1 is particularly gratifying to us on a number of accounts As mentioned PP1 is a highly conserved enzyme and toxin sensitive Ser Thr phosphatase activities are also found in erythrocytes 15 Thus use of PP1 inhibitors such as okadaic acid or tautomycin Fig 4 would affect the parasite as well as the host making conclusions difficult The dsRNA in contrast is known to be extremely specific for its intended target such that a single nucleotide mismatch prevents its action 17 This has allowed us to create specific phenotypic loss of PfPP1 Moreover RNAi will permit the ablation of essential gene products at any time point in infection or on a desired parasitic stage following synchronization Lastly traditional genetic manipulation in eukaryotes including the Apicomplexa is a relatively difficult and elaborate procedure 45 46 Thus we believe that the RNAi strategy will become a powerful and convenient tool in Plasmodium functional genomics particularly in the studies of phylogenetically conserved signalling molecules Conclusion P falciparum contains a PP1 protein phosphatase that is virtually identical to its orthologs in other species in both sequence and biochemical properties Based on the established physiological role of PP1 in other organisms such as mammals and yeast PfPP1 may regulate a variety of parasitic pathways including glycogen metabolism glucose repression and cell cycle progression Indeed the successful use of RNA interference to ablate PfPP1 confirms its essential role on parasitic growth The catalytic subunit of PfPP1 is expressed in all the erythrocytic stages of the parasite and is specifically inhibited by mammalian physiological inhibitors inhibitor 1 and inhibitor 2 Thus an in depth study of PfPP1 and its interacting subunits may shed light on the regulation of the relevant pathways in this clinically important family of parasites Materials and methods Materials Histone and the catalytic subunit of PKA were purchased from Sigma St Louis MO and rabbit I 2 the v abl protein tyrosine kinase and its peptide substrate EAIYAAPFAKKK were from New England Biolabs Bedford MA Okadaic acid OA and recombinant I 1 22

Transduction Laboratories Lexington KY This antibody reacts with all mammalian and avian PP1 tested but does not react with other PP classes The other PP1 antibody a kind gift from R Honkanen was specific for human PP1 and was raised in rabbit against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 13 residues of human PP1 PITPPRNSAKAKK Fig 2 The anti PfPP2A antibody was raised in rabbit against the peptide MLIFKDTPDSRNSIKN corresponding to residue 285 300 of the previously described PfPP2A 10 The RIG plasmid was kindly provided by W Hol University of Washington Howard Hughes Medical
