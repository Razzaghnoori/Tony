 Introduction Transforming growth factor TGF is a dimeric protein of 25 kDa molecular weight originally isolated from platelets 1 2 There are three distinct mammalian isoforms TGF 1 TGF 2 and TGF 3 with TGF 1 being the most abundant isoform Almost all cell types express TGF but the highest level of expression of TGF is in platelets and bone 3 Mature TGF 1 consists of two identical peptide chains each containing 112 amino acids linked via nine disulfide bonds 4 TGF 1 is synthesized as part of a large latent protein complex unable to bind to cellular receptors with mature active TGF 1 produced by cleavage 5 TGF 1 is a mutifunctional cytokine that plays an important role in immunomodulation inflammation and tissue repair 6 Many studies have suggested that TGF could be a potential therapeutic reagent for the repair of soft tissue and bone and following ischemic injury It may also have applications for the treatment of chronic inflammatory fibrotic and autoimmune diseases 7 8 In contrast other studies have demonstrated that TGF 1 can cause inflammation and fibrosis 9 10 The potential use of TGF 1 for the treatment of human disease thus remains controversial 11 Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic autoimmune disease It is characterized by a chronic erosive inflammation of painful and debilitating joints with progressive degradation of cartilage and bone accompanied by proliferation of the synovium 12 Rheumatoid arthritis remains incurable and in many patients difficult to treat As a novel approach to therapy we and other workers have focused on developing the methods for local transfer of genes encoding therapeutic agents to the joint 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 This strategy also can be applied to the treatment of osteoarthritis and for aiding the repair of the cartilage and other intra articular tissues Since TGF 1 has anti inflammatory properties as well as being able to stimulate new matrix synthesis by chondrocytes it represents a possible therapeutic agent with which to treat pathologies associated with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis by local gene delivery Other workers and ourselves have previously examined the effects of TGF 1 gene transfer on matrix synthesis in chondrocyte cultures demonstrating a significant stimulation in the production of proteoglycans 9 In addition we have demonstrated that the TGF 1 gene was able to overcome the inhibitory effects of IL 1 on matrix metabolism in chondrocytes in culture 20 To examine the effect of TGF 1 on joint pathology we used adenovirus mediated intra articular gene delivery to confer sustained intra articular TGF 1 expression in both na ve and arthritic rabbit knee joints Intra articular injection of adenoviral vector expressing human transforming growth factor Ad TGF 1 resulted in a high level of TGF 1 accumulation in the synovial fluid Intra articular TGF 1 expression was anti inflammatory inhibiting white blood cells However TGF 1 expression also induced significant pathology in the rabbit knee as well as in the adjacent muscle including stimulation of glycosaminoglycan GAG release and nitric oxide synthesis and enhancement of fibrogenesis and muscle edema These results suggest that although TGF 1 may have anti inflammatory effects sustained expression of TGF 1 has adverse effects on joint pathology Materials and methods Vector construction The recombinant adenoviral vector used in the present study originates from replication deficient type 5 adenovirus lacking E1 and E3 loci 21 The human TGF 1 cDNA was inserted in place of the E1 region in the shuttle plasmid pAd Lox 22 where expression is driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter The recombinant Ad TGF 1 virus was generated by Cre Lox driven recombination in Cre 8 cells 22 Briefly a confluent 10 cm 2dish of Cre 8 cells 1 6 10 7 was split into five 6 cm 2dishes Transfection of these cells with pAd Lox human TGF 1 was performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method with 3 g pAd Lox human TGF 1 construct digested with Sfi I and 3 g 5 helper virus DNA The transfected Cre 8 cells were fed daily until there were visible plaques The cells were harvested and exposed to three cycles of freeze thaw The recombinant virus was purified and amplified by infecting two 10 cm dishes of Cre 8 cells using 100 l lysate The Ad TGF 1 virus was purified using cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation at 154 000 g 30 000 rpm and 4 C and then dialyzed three times against Tris buffered saline The titer was determined by measuring the viral DNA at optical density 260 nm OD 260 nm using the formula viral particles OD 260 nm dilution 9 09 10 13 The adenovirus expressing luciferase was kindly provided by J Kolls LSU Medical Center New Orleans LA USA Animals and experimental arthritis New Zealand white rabbits weighing 4 5 kg were purchased from Myrtles Rabbitry Thompson Station TN USA To establish antigen induced arthritis AIA rabbits were sensitized to ovalbumin by intradermal injections of 5 mg ovalbumin emulsified in Freund s complete adjuvant Arthritis was initiated in both hind knees of rabbits 3 weeks later by the intra articular injection of 5 mg ovalbumin dissolved in 0 5 ml Gey s saline The different adenoviral vectors were injected intra articularly 24 hours after injection of antigen Experimental protocol Twenty four hours after induction of AIA adenoviral particles encoding either the human TGF 1 or luciferase were suspended in 0 2 ml Gey s saline and injected into the joint space of the knee through the patellar tendon Different doses of virus 1 10 7 1 10 8and 1 10 9 viral particles were injected intra articularly into three rabbits per group for analysis of the effects of TGF 1 on na ve joint pathology and the treated rabbits were sacrificed 7 days postinfection to observe the dose response effects Another group of three na ve rabbits was injected with 1 10 9viral particles and sacrificed 17 days postinfection for long term observation There were two groups of AIA rabbits used in the study The first group of three rabbits was injected with 1 10 8viral particles and the second group of six rabbits was injected with 1 10 9viral particles Each rabbit received the indicated dose of TGF 1 virus in one knee and the same amount of the adenoviral vector expressing luciferase Ad Luc virus in the opposite knee as the control To lavage the rabbit knee joints 1 ml Gey s saline was injected into the joint space through the patellar tendon After manipulation of the joint the needle was reinserted and the fluid was aspirated Leukocytes in recovered lavage fluids were counted using a hemocytometer The levels of TGF 1 in conditioned media lavage fluids and sera were measured using an ELISA kit R D Systems Minneapolis MN USA as directed by the supplier The levels of sulfated GAGs in lavage fluids were determined using a colorimetric dye binding assay using 1 9 dimethylmethylene blue 23 The levels of total nitrite in lavage fluids were measured with Nitric Oxide Assay kits Calbiochem Biosciences Inc La Jolla CA USA Articular cartilage fragments shaved from the femoral condyles were placed into 1 ml Neuman Tyell serum free medium Gibco New York USA to measure the rate of proteoglycan synthesis The fragments were then incubated with 35SO 4 2 20 Ci for 24 hours at 37 C and the media harvested and stored at 20 C Proteoglycans were extracted from the cartilage by incubation for 48 hours in 1 ml of 0 5 M NaOH at 4 C with gentle agitation Following chromatographic separation of unincorporated 35SO 4 2 using PD 10 columns Pharmacia Uppsala Sweden the levels of radiolabeled GAGs released onto the culture media or recovered by alkaline extraction were quantitated by scintillation counting 24 Histology For histological analyses tissues harvested from dissected knees were first fixed in 10 formalin The fixed tissues were imbedded in paraffin sectioned at 5 m and stained with H E Statistical analysis All data collected are expressed as mean standard error Statistical significance was analyzed by analysis of variance and Student s t test Correlation coefficients r were calculated using Pearson s method Results Expression of TGF 1 after intra articular injection of Ad TGF 1 To test the effects of adenoviral mediated human TGF 1 gene expression in na ve and AIA rabbit joints 1 10 7 1 10 8and 1 10 9particles of Ad TGF 1 were injected into either na ve or arthritic rabbit knees The same amounts of Ad Luc were injected into the contralateral knees Lavages were performed on day 3 day 7 and day 17 and the levels of TGF 1 were determined by ELISA Fig 1 TGF 1 expression was detected in all knee joints receiving either 1 10 8or 1 10 9viral particles with higher levels detected in the arthritic knees A significant drop in TGF 1 expression was observed after 17 days of post viral injection No significant levels of TGF 1 were detected in the 1 10 7viral particle injection group and in the contralateral joints receiving the different doses of luciferase virus Furthermore no significant expression of TGF was detected in the serum It is important to note that detection of TGF 1 in the synovial fluid required acid activation suggesting that the protein is in its latent form Moreover there were no observed therapeutic or adverse effects following intra articular injection of the low dose 1 10 7particles of Ad TGF 1 Alterations in joint anatomy after intra articular Ad TGF 1 injection Three days after injection of Ad TGF 1 the knees receiving the highest dose of virus became enlarged with a reduction in joint movement In addition the muscles adjacent to the joints showed signs of swelling and reduced movement The animals were sacrificed on day 7 post injection and the joints were analyzed The size of the joints and the adjacent muscles increased dramatically both in na ve rabbits 1 5 contralateral knees P 0 05 and in AIA rabbits 1 25 contralateral knees P 0 01 Fig 2 The movement of joints was also severely limited with the Ad Luc contralateral knees moving freely at 180 whereas the knees treated with Ad TGF 1 virus could only move at 90 120 The limitation to joint movement was not due to the enlarged muscles since when the muscles were cut away the limitation of movement was still observed In addition when the joints were analyzed 17 days after viral injection at a time when the muscle size returned to normal the joint still could not move freely The limitation to joint movement could thus be due to possible synovial hyperplasia or effects on ligaments or cartilage metabolism It is important to note that we did observe an increase in creatine kinase levels in the serum that would suggest muscle damage data not shown In contrast to the high dose TGF 1 group only a very mild effect was observed on the gross joint structure in the group receiving 1 10 8viruses and no changes were observed in the group receiving 1 10 7viruses Effect of TGF 1 on cartilage metabolism To determine whether overexpression of TGF 1 had effects on cartilage metabolism in na ve and AIA rabbit joints GAG synthesis by articular cartilage and GAGs released into synovial fluid as a result of proteoglycan breakdown were measured The rabbit joints receiving Ad TGF 1 had significant higher levels of GAG release compared with the contralateral Ad Luc joints in lavage fluids at day 3 day 7 and day 17 for the na ve rabbits and at day 7 for the AIA rabbits Fig 3A 3B 3C GAG release levels correlated linearly with the levels of TGF 1 in lavage fluids r 0 937 in the na ve rabbits In addition only the highest dose of Ad TGF 1 was able to stimulate GAG synthesis in the na ve rabbit joints from day 7 and day 17 but the stimulation was marginal There was no statistically significant difference between GAG synthesis by the na ve rabbits with the two lower doses of viral injections and in the AIA rabbits Fig 3D 3E 3F Taken together these results suggest that intra articular expression of TGF 1 stimulated cartilage matrix degradation while having only a minor effect on the promotion of new matrix synthesis This is in contrast to the results observed on matrix synthesis in chondrocytes in culture where TGF 1 was able to stimulate significant new matrix synthesis as well as overcome the suppressive effects of IL 1 on matrix metabolism 21 25 Inhibition of white blood cell infiltration and elevation of nitric oxide synthesis To determine whether TGF 1 expression could inhibit the mild inflammation induced by intra articular injection of high doses of adenovirus or the severe inflammation occurring in the AIA model the levels of white blood leukocytic infiltrate in the synovial lavage fluids were determined Fig 4 The joints of na ve rabbits receiving the highest dose of Ad TGF 1 adenovirus had significantly lower levels of white blood cell infiltration in lavage fluids at day 3 day 7 and day 17 The white blood cell infiltration in the na ve joints directly correlated with TGF 1 expression levels in the lavage fluids r 0 954 In the AIA rabbit knee joints there was a reduction in the infiltration at day 3 and day 7 compared with the contralateral control Ad Luc joints consistent with TGF 1 having an anti inflammatory effect Surprisingly TGF 1 expression elevated nitrate levels in the joints receiving high dose injections of TGF 1 adenovirus at day 3 day 7 and day 17 for na ve rabbits and at day 7 for the AIA rabbits compared with the control joints Fig 4D 4E 4F The nitrate levels also directly correlated with the levels of TGF 1 in lavage fluids r 0 945 for na ve rabbits These results suggested that TGF 1 is indeed anti inflammatory in arthritic knees but is able to induce production of nitric oxide through an unknown mechanism Histological analysis of the intra articular effects of TGF 1 The na ve and AIA rabbit knee joints receiving Ad TGF 1 and Ad Luc were also examined by histology There was significant fibroblast proliferation around the myofibers in the na ve rabbits joint receiving Ad TGF 1 There was also mild hyperplasia of the synovial lining but without any evidence of inflammatory cells being observed Fig 5A 5B There were some inflammatory cells in the contralateral synovial lining but no evidence of synovitis Fig 5C 5D The synovium from the TGF 1 virus treated joints was highly fibrotic 17 days after viral injection with evidence of osteometroplasia found in the synovium Fig 5E 5F but with no evidence of inflammation or angiogenesis Fig 5F There was mild inflammation under the synovium in the contralateral joints receiving Ad Luc Fig 5G 5H The synovium in the Ad TGF 1 treated AIA rabbits showed evidence of hyperproliferation with mild inflammation Fig 5I 5J compared with the contralateral control joints that had severe inflammation Fig 5K 5L In the muscle tissue adjacent to Ad TGF 1 treated joints there was evidence of both fibroblast and myofibroblast proliferation between myofibers with intracellular edema but there was no evidence of inflammation or myonecrosis Fig 5M 5N In contrast the muscle tissue from the contralateral controls knees was normal Fig 5O 5P There was also mild fibroblast proliferation and synovial inflammation in the 1 10 8Ad TGF group but no significant histological changes were observed in the 1 10 7viral group These data taken together suggest that TGF 1 is able to stimulate fibrogenesis and to suppress inflammation Moreover the results suggest that elevated TGF 1 levels result in chondrogenesis within the synovial tissue Discussion TGF 1 is a mutifunctional cytokine that plays an important role in immunomodulation inflammation and tissue repair Given that TGF 1 is able to induce new matrix synthesis from chondrocytes in culture as well as able to block inflammation in vivo it has been proposed that local intra articular gene transfer of TGF 1 could be therapeutic for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis as well as osteoarthritis To examine the effects of TGF 1 on joint pathology we used adenovirus mediated intra articular gene delivery to confer sustained intra articular TGF 1 expression in both na ve and arthritic rabbit knee joints Intra articular injection of Ad TGF 1 virus into the rabbit knee resulted in dose dependent elevated levels of expression of TGF 1 in the synovial fluid but not in the serum Intra articular TGF 1 expression resulted in dose dependent biological effects in the rabbit knee as well as in adjacent muscle In particular local intra articular expression in na ve joints stimulated cartilage breakdown as measured by synovial GAG levels without enhancing new matrix synthesis In addition TGF 1 expression stimulated nitric oxide production Similarly in arthritic joints where TGF 1 expression inhibited white blood cell infiltration it also stimulated GAG release and nitric oxide production Although there was a reduction in inflammation in arthritic joints TGF 1 expression induced fibrogenesis and muscle edema In addition TGF 1 expression in the adenovirally infected synovial lining also resulted in induction of chondrogenesis in the synovium Elevated TGF 1 expression in the synovial fluid thus resulted in a variety of adverse pathological changes A previous study examined the effect of Ad TGF 1 in the knee joints of na ve C57 Bl 6 mice where gene transfer of TGF 1 to the mouse knee resulted in hyperplasia of the synovium as well as in chondro osteophyte formation at the chondrosynovial junctions 10 The present experiments have shown similar effects on synovial proliferation but also have extended the murine studies to examine the effects of TGF 1 in both diseased knee joints and normal knee joints in the rabbit Similar to the previous report we have observed evidence for intra synovial chondrogenesis as well as osteometroplasia following TGF 1 gene transfer Whether TGF 1 directly or indirectly stimulates proliferation of synovium is unclear but this pathology apparently is mediated through an IL 1 independent mechanism It has been speculated that intra articular delivery of TGF 1 would result in enhanced synthesis of new matrix 9 Indeed we have reported previously that the TGF 1 gene is more effective than insulin like growth factor type 1 and bone morphogenetic protein type 2 genes in stimulating new matrix synthesis from rabbit chondrocytes in culture We have also demonstrated that TGF 1 is able to partially overcome the inhibition of new matrix synthesis by IL 1 in cultured chondrocytes The results presented in the present article however suggest that TGF 1 expression is unable to enhance new matrix synthesis in vivo in either na ve joints or in particular in diseased joints Moreover it appears as if TGF 1 confers adverse effects by stimulating cartilage degradation through an unknown mechanism In contrast to the adverse effects of intra articular adenoviral gene transfer of TGF 1 we have shown that gene transfer of insulin like growth factor type 1 to the rabbit knee results in an increase in new matrix synthesis without any adverse effects 17 Taken together these results suggest that increasing the intra articular levels of TGF 1 has no therapeutic effect on cartilage metabolism resulting instead in higher rates in cartilage degradation Use of the synovium as a target tissue for TGF 1 gene transfer resulting in elevating the intra articular level is thus not appropriate for the enhancement of repair of cartilage defects Instead for TGF 1 gene therapy to be effective in promoting repair of damaged cartilage the level of TGF 1 will need to be highly regulated as well as expression localized TGF 1 expression would need to be targeted at the appropriate levels to the site of cartilage damage such as through gene transfer to chondrocytes or stem cells involved in repairing the damaged tissues TGF 1 has been shown to be therapeutic in several different animal models when expressed systemically from muscle tissue 26 27 This suggests that elevated serum levels of TGF 1 can reduce general inflammation as well as inhibit IL 1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha production resulting in a systemic therapeutic effect In addition TGF 1 has been shown to be therapeutic in murine models of collagen induced arthritis following delivery in genetically modified T cells 28 This observation suggests that targeting TGF 1 to certain sites of inflammation through the use of arthogenic T cells also can be therapeutic However our results suggest that local expression of TGF 1 unlike systemic expression is not therapeutic due to adverse pathologies associated with elevated intra articular TGF 1 expression Although our results do not preclude the development of gene therapy approaches to express regulated TGF 1 systemically to downmodulate the immune response the results suggest that any clinical application of local TGF 1 gene transfer should proceed with caution TGF 1 is clearly a potent cytokine able to confer multiple effects when expressed intra articularly in vivo Conclusion Gene transfer represents a novel method for obtaining high intra articular levels of therapeutic agents for the treatment of arthritis TGF 1 is able to stimulate new matrix synthesis by chondrocytes in culture as well as able to reduce inflammation in vivo In this report the effects of intra articular expression on both na ve and arthritic rabbit knee joint pathology were examined by adenoviral mediated intra articular gene transfer of TGF 1 The results suggest that elevated TGF 1 expression confers adverse joint pathology including an increase in cartilage matrix degradation without stimulating new matrix synthesis In addition TGF expression induces muscle edema and fibrogenesis Although TGF 1 may have certain anti inflammatory properties it is unable to stimulate repair of damaged cartilage and even stimulates cartilage degradation Moreover elevated TGF 1 expression also induced muscle edema and fibrogenesis Gene transfer of TGF 1 to the synovium is thus not suitable for treating intra articular pathologies such as the repair of damaged cartilage
