 The Emperor of Ice Cream Wallace Stevens needs to be read in isolation His poetry makes little sense in conjunction with anyone else s Like many people I was baffled when I first read his poems in high school anthologies The Emperor of Ice Cream sounded like antique mumbo jumbo in comparison with the up to the minute adolescent angst of The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock Only when I began to read the 1954 Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens did I come to terms with him Stevens eludes the anthologists because no one poem is the great one It s the total book that counts You can pick up the new Library of America edition turn to any page and sink yourself into the unconditional unfootnotable splendor of the voice I am not sure if this edition is the ideal packaging of Stevens even though it includes more of his work than any previous collection did It may include too much the words look smaller the margins thinner For a writer as worshipful of words as Stevens these slight differences matter Stevens rough chronological equivalence with Joyce and Eliot has created a mistaken notion that his poems are rich in complexity Blessedly they are not Stevens offers a double liberation first from meaning then from modernist meaninglessness His world is separate immaculate You do not need a Dublin map or a German phrase book to travel in it Academic interpreters have failed to meet the challenge posed by Helen Vendler in her landmark study On Extended Wings to give up the search for intellectual subject matter and to treat Stevens as pure sound Vendler herself sometimes fails to meet that standard She offers ingenious paraphrases and elaborations but she imposes a false order on a genially chaotic world She looks for process and argument in a poet who excels at sudden revelations in miniature She and others have also promoted the idea that the greatest Stevens is to be found in his ambitious long poems But it is in those poems Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction and An Ordinary Evening in New Haven that his language is driest his images dullest Stevens came closer to the Supreme Fiction in short forms in fragments Rather than try to launch a new exegesis I want to name a few simple technical devices with which Stevens makes his verbal music More often than not he writes in iambic pentameter the antiquated base rhythm of English poetry Take the famous opening line of The Idea of Order at Key West She sang beyond the genius of the sea Click for a longer sample He chooses the sounds with great care In this line the vowels almost rhyme ee ah ee aw eh ee yuh oh eh ee Only two words have more than one syllable Stevens follows to extremes the old schoolhouse rule that short words work better than long ones Like Shakespeare he loved the heave and ho of a line in which each beat has its own word A lot of classic oratory also relies on monosyllables The only thing we have to fear is fear itself Ask not what your country can do for you In Stevens monosyllables run riot sometimes saturating several consecutive lines as in the vertiginously beautiful climax of Esth tique du Mal Click The Idea of Order culminates in another highly monosyllabic line And when she sang the sea Whatever self it had became the self that was her song for she was the maker But as the language grows ever more chiseled and incisive the picture grows more vague That woman singing on the beach is dissolving into abstraction It seems as though some principle is being preached At this point if you read the poem in high school or college you may remember deadly questions intruding from the poetry anthologies Does the sea represent language Is the woman the poet Any question about meaning in Stevens whether well or badly formed ruins the trance His words are a dream melody of language bells from nowhere You can hear as much in tapes of Stevens reading aloud he is so intent on keeping an even magisterial tone that he occasionally loses himself in the convoluted syntax on which Vendler expends such analytic energy Stevens fashioned a new oratory free of meaning he wrote a surreal agnostic King James Bible culled from dilettante philosophy dated chinoiserie and picture postcard Americana Stevens grandeur is an inch away from absurdity if not in the thick of it This is by intention He liked to deflate solemnity with silliness His humor is his least noticed attribute probably because it is so widespread Even his titles The Revolutionists Stop for Orangeade The Emperor of Ice Cream undercut their own pomposity Sometimes I think Stevens was a collegiate prankster who never gave away the joke he played on literature He comes close in some of the offbeat writings that appear toward the end of the Library of America edition especially in such nonsense aphorisms as A poem is a cafe A poem is a pheasant and All men are murderers More than a few of the poems I think are self parodies although it s hard to say which A good candidate is Of Hartford in a Purple Light A long time you have been making the trip From Havre to Hartford Master Soleil Bringing the lights of Norway and all that Stevens securely employed for much of his adult life by the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co could afford to laugh aloud at the pretensions of the poetry business The closeness of the sublime and the ridiculous of the daft and the grand is central to Stevens The poem that sets it out most clearly is The Man on the Dump in which he writes One sits and beats an old tin can lard pail One beats and beats for that which one believes The monosyllables are the meaning of the poem the acting out of a literary philosophy which is to hammer new beauty from well worn words and modern bric a brac The poem goes on to ask these questions about the poet s task Is it to sit among mattresses of the dead Bottles pots shoes and grass and murmur aptest eve Is it to hear the blatter of grackles and say Invisible priest is it to eject to pullThe day to pieces and cry stanza my stone Yes it is this is what poetry is But Stevens frames his manifesto in questions as if uncertain I think he s pointing up a contradiction The poetry that he imagines being murmured on the dump aptest eve invisible priest stanza my stone is not in itself distinguished by intention it s a bit ridiculous The sublimity comes in the way those fragments of a Romantic vision glide together with artifacts of ordinariness bottles pots shoes grass The poem performs its theme it is self sufficient it runs on its own power It is the purity of Stevens language that makes the Library of America edition edited by Frank Kermode and Joan Richardson seem a bit off Not only do the poems look better in the Collected Poems which to be sure omits great ones early and late they are also unencumbered by comparison with the uncollected poems which include a lot of mystifying mediocrity It s good to have all the poems in one place and also the published prose and a smattering of letters But it s also distracting and occasionally misleading You can t find the real Stevens voice in the early poems but you can find it in early letters not printed here In one the teen age Stevens writes a dead on Stevensian description of a motley village band the piping of flamboyant flutes the wriggling of shrieking fifes with rasping dagger voices the sighing of bass viols drums that beat and rattle the crescendo of cracked trombones Eight years later the young man writes flamboyantly to his fiancee I believe that with a bucket of sand and a wishing lamp I could create a world in half a second that would make this one look like a hunk of mud For all its omissions Collected Poems is the better picture of that awesome world
