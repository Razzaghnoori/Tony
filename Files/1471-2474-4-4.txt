 Background In the past animal models in the study of disc degeneration have most commonly involved dogs monkeys and sheep but in recent years the sand rat Psammomys obesus has been used because of the economic advantages of rodent models The spontaneous age related degeneration of the sand rat spine avoids the need for chemonucleolysis or surgical injury to induce disc degeneration The age related disc degeneration in the sand rat has been shown to be reliable and predictable and has been well characterized in previous radiologic studies 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 The present work extends the previous radiological studies in 1 to develop an automated computer assisted procedure that analyses digitized lateral x rays of the sand rat spine To create such a system the task of locating the vertebrae in the image is vital For this task previous works in x ray analysis were consulted and several possibilities were initially considered The main techniques in previous research used active shape models both customized and deformable Extensive research has been done by Long 10 11 12 to automatically identify and classify spinal vertebrae Others whose work includes the use of active shape models for vertebrae analysis are Smyth 13 and Zamor 14 Although the adaptability of active shape models is important b spline techniques are also valuable 15 These techniques which are adequate in the analysis of human spines were not selected in the present study because they still require user intervention and our objective was to develop a completely automated approach to the study of lateral films The specific goal of this study was to create an efficient automated method of identifying the overall angle of curvature of the spine the angles between individual vertebrae the distance between vertebrae and a scoring index for sclerosis present in the vertebral end plates which may be a major factor in reducing the nutrition available to the aging disc Resultant representative data are presented both graphically and numerically to illustrate the computer methods which are utilized The major emphasis of this pilot study was to accurately identify each of the vertebrae and then to obtain selected measurements The techniques presented here may have potential to produce quantitative algorithms that create more accurate and informative studies and measurements in a time efficient manner Methods Finding the Location of the Spine in the Image In order to analyse the vertebrae first the location of the spine in the image must be found In each of the images the location and angle of the spine can be clearly detected by finding the well defined soft tissue boundary of the body itself The first step in finding this boundary was to de noise the image using an adaptive Wiener filter 16 17 18 The goal was to minimize the amount of noise in the black area corresponding to the area outside the body Next Canny edge detection 19 was applied to obtain a binary image representing the edges in the X ray The reason the Canny edge detector was chosen over other edge detectors is because it is still a basic filter but also applies a Gaussian smoothing filter before its edge detection algorithm The strength of the edges detected is also controlled with this detection system which helps to enhance precision The Canny edge detector can be briefly described using Equation 1 developed to detect the local maxima in the direction perpendicular to the edge In Equation 1 represents the image G is a 2D Gaussian filleting operation and the second directional derivative is taken along the normal vector n Using this edge detected image the boundary was traced and the angles of its curvature recorded as shown in Figure 2 The process to this point generated two important sets of information First a set of points along the body s boundary was obtained which gives a good estimate for locating the vertebrae Second a set of angles that gives an estimate of how the underlying vertebrae are oriented was obtained Segmenting the Image Next with the data that provided the position and orientation of the spine it was necessary to segment the image based on orientation The purpose of this segmentation was two fold First the image must be broken into smaller portions for histogram equalization and contrast adjustment Because the image varies in quality and clarity in different portions of the image details visible in one portion of the image may not be clearly identifiable in other portions The second purpose segmentation served was to limit the search space for line segments see below The boundary points from the previous step were used to determine where the image was to be segmented The locations of these points for segmentation and their angles of curvature are shown in Table 1 Figure 3shows the results of Canny edge detection 19 before the image was segmented The edges of the end plates were not clearly visible because different threshold values needed to be used for separate portions of the image A threshold value applied to the entire image can neglect needed information and may detect more noise than the true edges The image was segmented in locations where the change in orientation of the detected boundary became greater than twenty degrees Figure 4 A ten pixel overlap between segments was used to avoid accidentally missing features that lie near segment boundaries From this point each segment was processed independently Figure 5 Reductions or Elimination of Segment Background In order to obtain an image where the vertebrae were clearly defined it was necessary to eliminate as much of the background noise and other objects in the image as possible High boost filters as well as histogram equalization 20 were both tested for this process While both techniques required some logic to determine the best values for filtering the image histogram equalization appeared to be the stronger of the two techniques as it allowed an analysis of the distribution of intensities in the image and adjusted the histogram accordingly Histogram equalization can be briefly described using Equation 2 where g is the original grey level g is the equalized G m is the maximum grey level A 0 is the area of the image and H u is the histogram Figure 6shows the effects of the histogram equalization The equalization highlighted the distinction of vertebrae vs the surrounding tissues making the vertebrae more visible and the boundaries more identifiable This step also normalized the images reducing the variance among the images for the measuring of sclerosis and helped increase the accuracy of the edge detection Hough transform 21 discussed below Locating Vertebral End Plates The image was segmented such that each segment contained vertebrae of similar orientation Each segment s histogram was also manipulated such that the vertebrae were well defined The remaining processing steps can be described as follows 1 First Canny edge detection 19 was performed on the image segment This time threshold values that specifically eliminated the false edges were used The false edges were a result of noise and other edges in the image that were not part of the spine These threshold values were based on the segment s histogram from the previous step The objective was to preserve the edges of the end plates while at the same time eliminating as many of the other extraneous edges as possible 2 Once the edge image was produced it underwent a Radon transform 22 The Radon transform of a binary image is essentially a Hough transform 21 The Hough transform Figure 7 gives an idea of where lines are located in an image by counting consecutive points in each direction The Hough transform was used because it was originally designed to detect straight lines with no prior knowledge of the region being necessary The theory behind the Hough transform is as follows 19 All lines going through a given point can be represented by one equation y 1 kx 1 q Equation 3 for some values of k and q Meaning that Eq 3 can be taken as an equation in the parameter space k q thus all the lines through a given point A can be represented by q x 1 k y 1 Equation 4 and all the lines passing through a given point B can be represented by q x 2 k y 2 Equation 5 Then the only common point on both lines in the k q parameter space is the point in the image that represents the only existing line between points A and B The goal is to determine all possible line pixels and transform the lines that go through the pixels into points in k q space and to detect the points a b that result from the Hough transform of lines y ax b in the image The directions searched in the Hough transform were constrained by using the angles that provided the basis for segmentation This eliminated many of the false line detections by limiting the orientations allowed 3 The best line candidates of all those produced by the Hough transform were selected Figure 8 These lines matched the location and orientation of each of the vertebral end plates The line candidates located near each selected candidate intersect near or at the midpoint of the end plate edge This allowed accurate estimation of the midpoint of each end plate These midpoints were then used for accurately finding the orientation and location of individual vertebrae 4 A new index of sclerosis to describe the amount of calcification on each vertebra was introduced as This index is a relation between the intensity of the vertebra at an end plate and the intensity of the vertebra at the center In the image the higher the intensity value the more bony sclerosis is present i e the degree of sclerosis is greater As a note this index is only a measurement no interpretations are made at this point Results Overall Curvature Overall curvature was determined as the difference between the orientations of the beginning and ending vertebra and is shown in Table 3 This measurement could have also been modelled with circle detection where the spine represents a segment of the circle Angles of Individual Vertebra An estimation of this measurement was obtained by using the output of the line detection method described in section 2 and shown in Figure 9 This gives an indication of the midpoints of the end plates as well as the orientation of those end plates This information resulted to the slope from the midpoint of one end plate to the midpoint of the other The angles of the vertebrae are given by the Orientation Angle column in Table 2 Since not every end plate could be found with the line detection method the shape detection methods provide a more reliable basis for this measurement Distances Between Vertebras The distance between the vertebrae was determined by finding the pixel length of the vertebrae and the pixel length of the gap between their left neighbouring vertebrae In Table 2 the vertebral length and the pixel space between vertebrae are given by the Vertebra Length and Space respectively Index of Sclerosis at End Plates This measurement of sclerosis was a ratio between the average pixel intensity near the center of a vertebra and the pixel intensity at each end plate Figure 10 calculated by Equation 1 The histogram equalization was essential for these calculations so there will not be a high degree of variance between subsequent images The index value for the left end cap compared to the center is the Sclerosis Upper Index column and the index value for the right end cap compared to the center is the Sclerosis Lower Index column in Table 2 Discussion The results generated from this new application of computer analysis applied to a small group of representative x rays indicate that the computer aided method developed here is practical for automated calculation and analysis of the overall curvature of the spine individual vertebra angles vertebral spacing and sclerosis measurement The computational techniques can also provide quantitative means that can then be used to explore the relation between age and conformation of the vertebrae The two most important steps in the process reported here are the location of the edges of the vertebrae and the location of the midpoints of the end plates Future applications of the techniques developed here could potentially be applied to either human or large animal radiographs The proposed method can be applied to further our methods of analysis in animal models of important features of spine aging such as sclerosis of the vertebral end plates Bernick and Cailliet have suggested that sclerosis of the end plate may act to impede nutrient flow into the disc 23 and that progressive end plate sclerosis with aging contributed to disc degeneration Concomitantly however disc degeneration by changing stress patterns on end plate bone may also cause increases in bone density in parts of the end plate subjected to greater stress 24 25 26 27 Modic et al have provided the major clinical study of end plates in degenerating discs 28 They reported that discs which showed in an MRI a decrease in signal intensity on T1 weighted spin echo images and increased signal intensity on T2 weighted images Modic type 1 exhibited disruption and fissuring of the end plates Endplates showed woven bone thick trabeculae with active bone remodeling and fibrous marrow Modic type 2 MRI changes characterized by increased signal intensity on T1 weighted images and isointense or slightly increased signal intensity on T2 weighted images showed a progression to disrupted end plates and reactive bone tissue and the presence of fatty marrow Conclusions Performing accurate analysis of vertebrae based on radiographic images is a challenging image processing task The automated system presented here applies robust image processing techniques to find important measures of degeneration in the aging spine such as separation and angle between vertebrae measurement of sclerosis and orientation of vertebrae The main advantages of this method are that unlike humans the computer can make exact quantitative measurements the computer is not subjective does not depend on the investigator it provides faster analysis and the image quality can be improved before analysis to allow more accurate measurements The main disadvantages are that the X ray must be digitized producing extra costs and complexity and humans might use certain heuristics that cannot be directly translated into mathematical methods for the computer to imitate Some limitations to the method include that the overall accuracy is dependant on the quality of data used the orientation of the spine in the image must be within a certain degree to be analyzed and a large data set is necessary to be able to usefully interpret the measurements generated The main sources of error that were identified are the fact that the lower the quality of the input image the higher the chance for miss measurements because the identification of the landmark features may be incorrect and that the overall orientation measurements can be incorrect due to the orientation and location of the spine in the images In addition the method can be used to quantitatively study the relation between the age and vertebral changes This automated system can greatly enhance the research on spine and disc degeneration in sand rats and other rodent models that provide an economically attractive alternative to large animal
