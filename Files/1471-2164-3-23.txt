 Background Hypothesis formulation The assessment of bias in dinucleotide relative abundance begins with the odds ratios r xy f xy f x f y where f x denotes the normalized frequency of nucleotide base x and f xy is the frequency of dinucleotide base step xy in the leading strand These ratios compare observed dinucleotide frequencies to those expected from the base composition alone under the assumption of statistical independence i e thorough shuffling of the sequence When r xy is greater less than one xy is over under represented The symmetrized version r xy is computed from frequencies of the sequence concatenated with its inverted complement The numbers r xy comprise the dinucleotide relative abundance profile 3 4 5 6 The statistical problem is to test the hypotheses that patterns of dinucleotide over and under representation in a given genome are invariant Using symbol f for frequencies in windows let g be used to represent the global frequencies computed for a complete sequence a genome or chromosome The hypothesis asserts that r xy in any window is approximately equal to a constant This constant is the global signature c xy g xy g x g y Karlin Landunga and Blaisdell 8 assessed homogeneity of the dinucleotide relative abundance profile through the delta distance 1 16 r xy c xy They provided standards for classifying in 100 kb windows as follows random 0 1000 15 very close 15 1000 30 close 30 1000 45 moderately related 45 1000 65 and distantly related 65 1000 95 The upper limit of the random range which typifies thoroughly shuffled sequences scales as 1 n where n is the number of bases in the window The local stability of r xy would be an ancillary result under the assumption of a stationary stochastic process since then the frequencies converge in probability to fixed limits f x p x and f xy f x p xy as n The simplest case would be a homogeneous Markov chain with base step transition probabilities p xy and stationary base composition p x In this case the differences f x p x and f xy f x p xy tend to zero as 1 n and it is clear that r xy p xy p y will vanish at the same rate 18 Moreover the globally computed quotient c xy g xy g x g y would be a consistent estimate of p xy p y Thus the separate terms of r xy c xy tend to zero as 1 n and the same must obviously apply to We start however with the understanding that the sequence is fundamentally nonstationary exhibiting statistically significant variations in base frequencies between non overlapping windows 1 2 Locally or globally estimated Markov models may describe it better than assuming that the bases are independent and identically distributed 19 but they fail to reflect the salient features of natural sequences 20 For example Robin and Daudin 21 compared the frequency of a specific motif in the genome sequence of Haemophilus influenzae to Markovian predictions and found that the observed frequencies were everywhere higher than predicted This point aside the stationary Markov analogy provides a useful benchmark in assessing local stability of the genomic signature If nucleotide sequences behaved like Markov chains then n would not depend on n We will examine this scaled delta distance n to see if it exhibits any trend A decreasing super Markov trend would imply that signature stability emerges as the scale increases and could indicate the breakdown of stability for some window size below 50 kb Scope of the investigation This survey examines 22 sequences from 19 species and 17 genera The sequences are listed in Table 1along with serial numbers SN and 4 letter abbreviations Abbr Most of them have been previously studied and found to show stability of the genomic signature in 50 kb windows 9 The shortest is the 580 kb complete genome of Mycoplasma genitalium The longest complete sequence is the 7657 kb human chromosome XXII The selected sequences which are not always complete genomes fall into two main classes being typically 1 the chromosome that constitutes the largest single element in a prokaryotic genome or 2 one of the chromosomes in a eukaryotic genome In the first case for example is the Borrelia burgdorferi sequence that excludes 21 identified plasmids The second case is exemplified by Plasmodium falciparum where chromosomes II and III are selected to the exclusion of the other 12 Since our investigation focuses on scaling properties of the genomic signature it is appropriate to consider sequences comprised of many 50 kb contigs assuming that variation between such contigs is small compared to variation between species The present sample which spans a wide range of G C proportion is hoped diverse enough that any consistent trends and features in the statistical picture it produces cannot be easily attributed to chance A broader range of sequences including mitochondrial and large viral genomes has been surveyed by Karlin et al 3 4 6 8 9 12 17 using 50 kb and larger windows This investigation which applies similar methodology to smaller window sizes concerns the intra genomic homogeneity of dinucleotide relative abundance and inter sequence distance calculations are beyond its scope Our use of nonoverlapping windows is consistent with the methodology employed in prior studies using 50 kb and longer windows Overlapping windows with a high percentage overlap would be required to localize and sort out the significance of nonconforming segments that could possibly reflect a foreign signature Overlap would introduce statistical dependence between successive windows and such dependence could only complicate the analysis of variance within sequences Window size was varied by factors of approximately two the specific values being 50 kb 25 kb 10 kb 5 kb 2 kb 1 kb 500 b 250 b and 125 b Results and discussion Increasing trend in mean scaled delta distance Table 2shows mean scaled delta distance by sequence Abbr and window size n Scaled delta distance defined above as n is a statistical invariant for any benchmark sequence generated by a Markov chain exhibiting the same signature as the given sequence Except for the Borrelia burgdorferi sequence the mean scaled delta distance is increasing in window size for every sequence The lone exception is a drop for B burgdorferi from 3 580 to 3 553 as window size increases from 10 kb to 25 kb The essentially increasing trend in n has an obvious implication for the scalability of standard binning levels used in classifying intra genomic delta distance 8 These levels cannot be re scaled by the reciprocal square root of window size without admitting that the profiles seen through smaller windows are statistically closer to the global signature The profiles seen through larger windows obviously tend toward the signature but local fluctuations tend to zero slower than 1 n i e the convergence rate is sub Markov Quasi stable hierarchy of mean scaled delta distances The rows of Table 2are grouped as archaea Aful Mjan protist Pfa2 Pfa3 yeast Sc11 Sc15 plant Ath4 human Hs22 or bacteria all 14 others Rows are averaged in groups and the results are plotted in Figure 1 Granted that the curves for archaea and bacteria are almost indistinguishable we see that ranking mean scaled delta distances by groups produces about the same result for every window size The one clear exception is the crossing of the curves for plant Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome IV and human chromosome XXII between n 2 kb and n 5 kb Thus the view through 50 kb windows shows that the imprint of the global signature is weaker in the latter but 2 kb and smaller windows show relatively clearer imprints in the human chromosome Normality and homoscedasticity of log delta The increasing trend in all the curves of Figure 1suggests that local deviations from the global signature are better described by a multiplicative error process instead of additive Therefore we examine the natural logarithms of the delta distances in windows and find that they are close to normally distributed with nearly constant variance over the range of window size Mean values of log are shown in Table 3with corresponding standard deviations in Table 4 Each pair of corresponding cells in Tables 3and 4defines a normal distribution with mean a variance determined by a sample of observed delta distances Each sample is subjected to the Kolmogorov Smirnov test of fit to the corresponding normal distribution 22 We generate a random sample of the same size as the observed sample from a normal distribution with the same parameters The Kolmogorov Smirnov two sample test is then invoked The null hypothesis is that the observed and simulated samples share a common underlying distribution P values from the test which measure support for the null hypothesis of normality are shown in Table 5 The bottom row of Table 5counts by window size the number of times the test accepts normality of log at the 5 significance level Delta distances tend to fit the log normal distribution better for window sizes 1 kb and larger Rejection of log normality for the smallest window sizes is to some extent a consequence of increasing sample size The apparent goodness of fit actually gets better as window size decreases as illustrated in Figure 2for three indicated window sizes on the Haemophilus influenzae sequence The sample CDF approaches a smooth curve as window size declines and the number of windows increases The heavy plotted points are from log normal distribution functions with means and variances of the corresponding samples Sub Markov convergence rate of mean log delta Since n is essentially increasing in n we infer that the locally computed dinucleotide relative abundance converges to the global signature more slowly than the reciprocal square root of window size The log normality of the intragenomic delta distance suggests a log linear model of the form log log n for intercept and slope coefficients that can be estimated for each sequence or group by simple linear regression Table 3 columns 10 and 11 give intercept and slope coefficients of least squares fits to the scatter plots of mean log versus log n Column 12 gives the mean absolute residual MAR to indicate the closeness of the straight line fit All estimated slope coefficients are greater than the benchmark value 1 2 implied by the Markovian analogy Figure 3shows least squares fits to log log scatter plots obtained by grouping rows of Table 3 in the same as way described above for going from Table 2to Figure 1 Weakly consistent patterns of intragenomic variability in delta distance Residual accumulated delta distance RADD is defined as window size times the cumulative sum of terms t mean t 1 2 T where t is the position index counted in windows from the 5 end and T is the total number of windows Here mean is just the average of unscaled delta distances in windows of size n Since 1 T T mean a plot of RADD versus t always returns to zero The RADD plot will superficially resemble random walks obtained by integrating counts of purine minus pyrimidine bases Such walking plots are useful in depicting long range compositional biases concomitant to replication 7 and their self similarity with respect to re scaling has been said to instantiate the fractal geometry of nature 23 24 Here we use the RADD plot to examine how well delta distances in smaller windows are smoothed by corresponding larger windows For example take a single 50 kb window on the M genitalium sequence compute its delta distance from the global signature then divide it into 50 contiguous 1 kb windows and repeat the calculation for each piece Do the 50 delta distances exhibit random fluctuations about the level indicated by the single larger window If so the patterns would be judged consistent and that result would typify a stationary process Such consistency is only weakly evidenced In Figure 4 however as larger scales give rise to emergent trends The same effect is seen in Figure 5where the 125 b and 1 kb traces track each other closely but diverge from the other traces in the central region Conclusions The imprint of the global signature is locally pervasive on all scales considered in the sequences that were scanned No lower bound can yet be placed on the local scale on which the global signature is reflected The inter genomic hierarchy of mean intra genomic delta distances is essentially preserved across the range of window sizes Intra genomic delta distance is approximately log normally distributed in windows down to 1 kb and the variance of log delta is fairly uniform across the set of sequences Delta distance tends to zero with increasing window size but the rate of this convergence is significantly slower than for simple random processes Methods The sequences listed in Table 1were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank 25 in FASTA format and saved as plain text files The last two columns of Table 1provide GenBank accession numbers and approximate dates of the revisions used in this analysis The sequences as text files were processed by routines written in SPlus Version 4 5 The texts were read in blocks contigs of 50 kb when computing delta distances in 50 kb and 25 kb windows or 20 kb for smaller windows Counts of overlapping base steps in windows were computed with the last base of one window serving as the first base of the next Thus the number of base steps in a window is equal to the number of bases not one less However one base step was uncounted at the start of every block Incomplete windows in the last block were discarded and blocks past end of file were ignored Sometimes complete blocks near end of file were omitted With the exception of Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome IV the total sequence lengths in kilobases are listed in the fourth column kb of Table 1 All corresponding sample lengths are at least 96 of total length and most are close to 99 when texts were read in 20 kb blocks For A thaliana however the global signature was computed from a scan of the 99 complete sequence but local delta distances from the global signature were computed only for the first 50 of the complete sequence due to computing difficulties The 8750 kb length for this sequence in Table 1is therefore about half the total bases in the chromosome Authors
