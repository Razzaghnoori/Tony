 Background The actin cytoskeleton plays a central role in cell motility movement and morphology The ability of soluble monomeric G actin to polymerize into filamentous F actin in a reversible manner is central to the cellular function of actin 1 2 Rearrangement of actin is promoted rapidly by extracellular stimuli and is facilitated by sets of actin associated proteins one of which is profilin 2 It is now appreciated that a large number of cellular parasites co opt actin for their gene expression and replication in the host cell 3 4 Due to its primary role in pediatric respiratory disease and the enormous human and economic toll it exacts throughout the world the respiratory syncytial virus RSV and its interaction with the host cell have received serious attention RSV is a member of the Pneumovirus genus in the Paramyxoviridae family and contains a nonsegmented negative stranded RNA genome of about 15 kb 5 The minimal viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase RdRP consists of two virally encoded proteins the large protein L and the phosphoprotein P 6 7 8 and a third viral protein M2 1 22K contributes RNA antitermination function and optimal processivity 9 In addition to these viral proteins the RdRP also requires cellular actin Biochemical reconstitution studies using purified recombinant actin in vitro and studies in RSV infected cells ex vivo demonstrated that actin functions as a viral transcription factor in both monomeric G and filamentous F forms whereas the filamentous form appeared to be particularly important for viral morphogenesis 10 Subsequent studies showed that at saturating actin concentration profilin stimulated viral transcription even further whereas profilin by itself had no transcriptional activity in the absence of actin 11 These results suggested that the interaction of profilin with actin may be important for optimal activity of the RSV transcriptase It remained unknown whether profilin plays a similar role in vivo Fusion of the infected cells is a hallmark of all Paramyxoviruses 12 the fused mass of cells is called syncytium from which RSV derives its middle name Although multiple viral proteins may be required for optimal syncytium induction the fusion protein F is the central mediator of the process 13 Syncytium most likely provides an efficient mechanism of cell to cell spread of the virus 12 14 however its exact role in productive RSV infection or in the pathology of the disease has remained unclear Interestingly RSV infection of HEp 2 cells also led to the formation of actin stress fibers and activation of the small cellular GTPase RhoA a modulator of actin filamentation 14 15 16 17 Inhibition of RhoA or its interaction with F resulted in the inhibition of syncytium as well as stress fiber formation and the second cycle of infection 14 Recombinant F also activated RhoA in the absence of any other viral protein 17 Based on these results it was inferred that stress fiber formation might be important in some aspects of RSV infection such as virus spread elaboration of cytokines from infected cells and contraction of airway muscles that promotes asthma The epithelial A549 cells of alveolar carcinoma origin exhibit many properties characteristic of the type II cells such as the ability to produce surfactants In cell culture A549 monolayer also faithfully exhibits various aspects of RSV infection and RSV host interaction including robust virus growth formation of syncytia activation of NF kappa B NF B and elaboration of a battery of cytokines in response to virus infection 18 19 20 21 22 In this paper we have therefore continued the use of A549 cells to elucidate the mechanism of RSV actin interactions and in particular test the role of profilin in the pathways that are likely to involve such interactions Results Viral partners of cellular profilin The minimal constituents of a nonsegmented negative strand RNA viral RdRP are the viral large protein L and the phosphoprotein P 23 While the L protein is believed to possess the basic RNA polymerase function the P protein serves as its transcription factor Together these proteins transcribe the genomic RNA wrapped with nucleocapsid protein N It is only the N RNA complex and not the naked RNA that serves as the functional template for the viral RdRP Because profilin like P also acts to stimulate viral transcription 11 we first tested if these two proteins interact directly in a purified system Recombinant His tagged P protein was immobilized on a Ni NTA column and purified recombinant human profilin was passed through it Results Fig 1 showed that profilin indeed bound to P and the two proteins were identified by staining as well as immunoblot analysis No profilin bound to a control column lacking P When an extract of A549 cells was passed through the P column a few additional bands of 30 34 kDa size range besides the 14 kDa profilin were found to associate to the column The identity of these bands was not determined but we have previously shown that the catalytic subunit of human PP2A which has a similar size binds to P 22 The specific affinity of all of these proteins for the P protein in the column was ascertained by the demonstration that pre incubation of the A549 extract with excess purified P abolished their binding to the column The reciprocal affinity experiment was not performed because we did not have a suitable matrix to immobilize profilin We then tested whether profilin interacts with viral proteins in the RSV infected cell An extract of the RSV infected A549 cells was first subjected to immunoprecipitation by anti P antibody and the precipitated proteins probed in immunoblot with profilin antibody Results Fig 2 showed that profilin was indeed present in association with RSV P protein lane 2 A reciprocal immunoprecipitation of the infected cell extract was carried out using anti profilin the precipitate was found to contain P protein lane 6 as well as profilin lane 5 Interestingly when this precipitate was probed with a mixture of antibodies against all RSV proteins in addition to P the nucleocapsid protein N was detected lane 7 To further test the specificity of the interaction of N and P with profilin another antibody specific for the viral fusion protein F was used to probe the profilin immunoprecipitate however no F was detected lane 8 As components of the functional viral RdRP N and P bind each other 23 It was therefore important to ask whether they need each other or other viral proteins in order to interact with profilin or whether they are individually capable of binding profilin To answer this question we expressed recombinant N and P proteins individually by transient transfection of uninfected A549 cells 21 and studied their association with profilin by co immunoprecipitation Results Fig 3 clearly demonstrate that N and P can each bind profilin independent of each other and in the absence of any other viral protein To investigate the role of profilin in host virus interaction in intact cells we sought to develop a profilin knock down cell by using RNA interference targeted against profilin mRNA as described under Materials and Methods RNA interference is now an established tool in knocking down specific intracellular mRNA in mammalian cell culture 24 and our laboratory has pioneered its use in virus infected cells 25 Results presented later Fig 4 panel A show that cells were substantially depleted of profilin at 200 nM siRNA In our routine experiments therefore we have used 400 nM siRNA to achieve an essentially profilin null cell These cells were infected with RSV and the infected cell lysates subjected to immunoprecipitation studies As shown in Fig 2 the anti P immunoprecipitate obtained from these cells while containing appreciable quantities of the P protein lane 3 did not contain any profilin lane 4 We note here that no stress fiber or syncytium was observed in cells expressing N and P data not shown which is consistent with the notion that these proteins are primarily involved in viral RNA synthesis Profilin plays a minor role in viral gene expression Because profilin stimulated RSV transcription in vitro 11 and associated with viral transcriptional proteins N and P the obvious next question was to ask how important profilin was for viral gene expression in the intact RSV infected cell Our ability to knock down profilin now provided us with an opportunity to answer this question The profilin depleted cells were therefore infected with RSV and virus specific RNA and proteins were quantified by appropriate techniques In the very first experiment of this series we sought to optimize the amount of siRNA and tested their effects on profilin and viral P protein in infected A549 cells As shown in Fig 4 a progressive loss of profilin panel A was not accompanied by any pronounced effect on P panel B suggesting that profilin may not have a major role in viral gene expression We then extended these studies to include two different cell lines and other viral proteins Use of an antibody mixture allowed us to detect viral G N P and M proteins panels C D In A549 human cells panel C there was a small reduction in these proteins ranging from 15 to 10 reduction at 200 400 nM siRNA in rat L2 cells panel D a somewhat greater reduction about 30 40 was observed To test if profilin had a role in viral RNA synthesis representative N and F mRNAs as well as the negative stranded viral genomic RNA were quantitated by real time RT PCR as described under Materials and Methods Results presented graphically Fig 4 panel E show that even at the highest siRNA concentration 400 nM at which essentially all the profilin was knocked down data not shown 60 80 of viral RNA synthesis continued in A549 cells whereas in L2 cells the effect was slightly more severe with 30 50 RNA synthesis remaining We conclude that profilin has only a minor role if any in the expression of RSV macromolecules in the infected cell although it is impossible to rule out that small amounts of profilin survived the knock down and sufficed for viral transcription Induction of actin stress fibers by RSV is cell specific and profilin dependent As discussed earlier RSV infection of HEp 2 cells was shown to rapidly induce the formation of actin stress fibers and this process required an interaction between viral fusion protein F and cellular G protein RhoA 17 To initiate studies of its mechanism we first tested the universality of this finding Three kinds of established epithelial cells of lung origin namely HEp 2 human A549 human and L2 rat were infected with RSV at various multiplicities of infection m o i and stress fibers were probed for at various times by staining as described under Materials and Methods Representative pictures clearly show that RSV infection evoked stress fiber response in HEp 2 cells Fig 5 compare uninfected cells in panel A with infected cells in panel B confirming previous findings 17 A particularly robust induction of stress fiber was also observed in the rat L2 cells Fig 6 panel B In contrast stress fibers were completely absent in RSV infected A549 cells Fig 7 suggesting that the signaling pathway that leads to stress fiber formation is missing or nonfunctional in A549 cells In order to investigate whether the formation of actin stress fibers requires profilin we knocked down profilin in the two cells where stress fibers were seen namely HEp 2 and L2 Upon RSV infection the profilin depleted cells failed to produce stress fibers Panel C in Figs 5 6 suggesting that stress fiber formation is a profilin dependent process However the loss of profilin had no detectable effect on intracellular RSV replication as determined by immunostaining of the cells with anti RSV antibody It also did not have any detrimental effect on growth or morphology of the host cells e g Panel D in Figs 5 6 at least up to 70 hrs of cell culture As stress fiber induction is a relatively early event in virus infection one might wonder whether it plays an important role in intracellular virus growth especially in the late phases However the results of Western blot real time PCR and immunostaining clearly revealed that RSV replicated equally well inside all three cells despite the fact that two of these cells HEp 2 L2 evoked stress fibers whereas the third A549 failed to do so Moreover all three cell lines elaborated very similar titers of infectious progeny virus in the range of 1 3 10 7pfu ml e g Table 1 Combining all these results with the previous ones 14 15 16 17 we conclude that profilin is important for stress fiber formation which is triggered by an interaction between viral F protein and cellular RhoA However neither profilin nor stress fibers may be essential for the intracellular replication of RSV Profilin is essential for syncytium formation and virion maturation As stated earlier the syncytium has been considered important for virus spread and pathology 17 Because profilin was obviously important in bringing about cytoskeletal changes it was logical to ask whether profilin also contributes to the fusion of cell membranes To answer this question we knocked down profilin by siRNA as before infected the cells with RSV and looked for syncytia at various time points Representative results at 48 hr post infection are presented in Fig 8 showing that while syncytia occurred in all three control cells untreated with the siRNA there were no syncytia in the profilin depleted cells However the infected cells still exhibited a general cytopathic effect because as we had shown earlier e g Fig 4 the intracellular growth of the virus occurred at about 85 90 efficiency in the absence of profilin The next obvious question was whether profilin is required for the final steps of the viral life cycle namely virus maturation and egress To answer this we measured the titer of infectious virions liberated from the three kinds of profilin depleted cells infected after 10 hr of siRNA treatment A representative set of results Table 1 show that such cells produced nearly a thousand fold less infectious virion Longer pre treatment with siRNA prior to the addition of the virus did not lead to further reduction of progeny yield suggesting that 10 hr of siRNA treatment was sufficient to achieve maximal reduction Virus titers were not affected in control cells treated with siRNA against luciferase mRNA 24 To examine the protein profile of the extracellular virions released from profilin depleted and undepleted cells the culture media of the two cells were collected and the virions were concentrated by sedimentation at 110 000 g As expected a much larger volume of the profilin depleted cell media was needed to produce a comparable amount of virus pellet However when equal amounts by protein assay of virus were analyzed by Western blot the two kinds of virions exhibited an identical profile of viral proteins including F data not shown In contrast while the virions from untreated cells contained substantial amounts of profilin confirming our previous finding 11 those from profilin depleted cells were found to be essentially devoid of profilin data not shown Thus it appeared that the small number of profilin free virus particles that were released from profilin depleted cells retained infectivity Clearly a more detailed and quantitative analysis will be needed to determine the relationship between the profilin content and infectivity of a virus particle Nevertheless we can conclude that profilin plays an essential role in the optimal yield of mature virions from all cells tested Discussion Results in this communication point to the existence of a number of potential cellular and viral interactive pathways in which profilin may play a cardinal role In fact profilin was found to be essential for all three effects tested viral maturation cell fusion and stress fiber formation Based on our findings and relevant published data we present a working model in Fig 9 For the sake of simplicity we have depicted profilin as functioning through actin in all these pathways This is certainly true for stress fiber induction as the stress fibers are physically made of filamentous actin For syncytium formation and viral maturation however we could not rule out the possibility that profilin might also have a direct role Knock down of actin completely destroyed the cell s architecture 26 and therefore was not a meaningful approach in these studies Similarly although the viral F protein is depicted as an important trigger for many pathways in this model Fig 9 other viral proteins and many cellular entities may act as important mediators at various steps In the following sections we discuss these biochemical pathways in some detail The membrane microdomains shown in Fig 9have recently received much attention as gateways of trafficking and signaling 27 28 Also called membrane rafts or lipid rafts they are specific membrane sites rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids These microdomains recruit an impressively large number of cellular proteins and regulatory molecules such as Rho profilin actin caveolin 1 CD44 and phosphotidylinositol 4 5 biphosphate PIP2 and have been shown to be important in a variety of cellular functions in health and disease 27 28 29 Recently a number of pathogens have been shown to hijack these sites for their entry exit and assembly such agents include many RNA viruses such as HIV measles virus influenza virus and RSV 29 30 31 32 33 In a very recent study 34 filamentous RSV was confirmed to exit through membrane microdomains and immunological analysis placed RSV proteins F N and P at these sites Combining these findings we propose that the activated RhoA utilizes profilin to bring about a net polymerization of actin in the RSV infected cells Fig 9 The actin filaments may anchor to specific membrane microdomains and together both of them make important contributions to RSV morphogenesis and host RSV signaling The cellular role or significance of stress fibers in general has remained uncertain In fact stress fibers could very well be artifacts of adherent growth on glass or plastic surfaces as they are rarely found in cells in tissues As we stated earlier the absence of stress fibers in the A549 cell suggests that stress fibers per se are not essential for RSV growth either and that one or more steps of the Virus F RhoA profilin actin signaling pathway is perhaps missing or nonfunctional in A549 We have not found any obvious difference in the expression of RSV proteins including F between the stress fiber responsive and unresponsive cells for example compare the 0 siRNA lanes of Panel C and D in Fig 4 The cellular proteins in this pathway are also evolutionarily conserved and indeed HEp 2 and A549 cells express comparable amounts of RhoA profilin and actin data not shown The functionality of the RhoA of A549 cells is substantiated by a number of previous studies such as the need for RhoA in bradykinin mediated activation of NF kappa B 35 and the abrogation of H 2 O 2 mediated activation of JNK by RhoA antisense oligonucleotide 36 Profilin purified from A549 cells is also indistinguishable from HEp 2 cell profilin in terms its molecular weight pI affinity for poly proline and ability to stimulate actin dependent transcription of RSV genome in vitro 11 Thus the inability of A549 cells to elicit actin stress fibers is likely due to an as yet unidentified factor or pathway that may be altered or missing in the A549 cells Evidently a detailed analysis of the relevant pathways in A549 and HEp 2 cells promises to shed light on this difference and lead to the identification of the missing function Regarding the syncytium it is well established that the F protein plays an active role in its formation Based on the premise described above it is conceivable that the membrane microdomains may serve as nucleation points for the initial mixing of the membrane lipids with help from F and this process may then travel through the membrane eventually producing a completely fused cell mass syncytium In this paper we have shown an importance of profilin in this process If this function of profilin is mediated through actin results from A549 cells suggest that the actin filaments F actin involved in syncytium must be smaller that stress fibers and not discernible by light microscopy It is possible that short F actin polymers anchored at the microdomains trigger syncytium This is so proposed in Fig 9 Although syncytium is a common and one of the most visible morphological outcomes of infection by many viruses including Paramyxoviruses 12 its relevance in virus replication has remained speculative Extrinsic chemical blockers of the F protein inhibited the very first step in infection i e attachment of the virus to the cell 37 suggesting an important role of F in this step In another study a different approach was taken to inhibit the intracellular function of F The domain of RhoA that binds to F was mapped to RhoA residues 77 95 14 In cell culture a peptide of this sequence inhibited syncytium and cell to cell spread of the virus suggesting that the two might be related and that syncytium formation required signaling through RhoA 14 The same peptide however also inhibited human parainfluenza virus type 3 HPIV 3 the reason for which was not obvious Moreover it remained unclear whether the signals that eventually led to syncytia had any effect of intracellular virus replication or maturation To answer these questions we have taken yet another approach in this paper by targeting profilin However we observed profilin dependence of viral maturation even in sub confluent monolayers where the cells were well separated as well as in single burst experiments data not shown Thus we suggest that profilin has a direct role in virus maturation independent of its role in cell fusion We would like to believe that syncytium is an outcome of viral infection and as such is unimportant for viral maturation in single cells We do not rule out however that cell fusion may accelerate virus spread through closely packed cells such as in an infected tissue Again it is quite possible that the microdomain anchored short actin filaments proposed above may allow the docking and assembly of subviral particles inside the infected cell Perhaps the observed interaction of profilin with N and P facilitates the transfer of the viral ribonucleoprotein to these filaments In the final phase of virus replication these same short F actins may also assist in virus locomotion and exit through the cell membrane As mentioned recent studies have indeed shown that budding of progeny RS virions occurs primarily through the membrane microdomains 34 To sum up profilin can act as a major liaison between viral proteins and actin and articulate multiple outcomes for both the cell and the virus involving signal transduction as well as cytoskeletal changes Fig 9 Studies in yeast and Drosophila indicated that profilin is generally nonessential for cellular viability although profilin mutants have phenotypes In yeast profilin null mutations result in cells that are viable at permissive temperature but grow more slowly are larger than wild type and are often multinucleate 38 The chickadee chic gene encodes Drosophila profilin and chic mutations produce sterile female flies 39 40 In both species profilin mutations resulted in defects in actin polymerization 38 39 40 In addition to regulating actin assembly a large body of in vitro and in vivo evidence suggests a role for profilin in signal transduction mainly involving PIP2 a major second messenger that strongly binds to profilin 41 and localizes to the membrane microdomains described earlier Thus in addition to the actin pathway the phospholipase C PIP2 pathway may also be involved in profilin s role in host RSV interaction In either case the relative nonessentiality of profilin in cellular viability makes it an attractive drug target for the intervention of viral pathogenesis over a short window of time It should be noted that besides profilin there are many other cellular proteins known to modulate actin filamentation and cytoskeletal dynamics and profilin itself binds to a large number proteins many with poly proline sequences 42 43 Clearly identification of the various members of the cytoskeletal signaling pathway will constitute an important step in understanding host RSV interaction and may lead to additional targets for pathological intervention In this paper we provide proof of concept that RNA interference can be a major tool in dissecting the pathways of host virus interaction Conclusions RNA interference using sequence specific siRNA can be successfully used to knock down profilin a major actin modulating protein of the eukaryotic cell Detailed studies of infection of such cells by RSV reveals that profilin is needed for cell fusion which is a universal response RSV infection in all cell lines tested Profilin is also essential for the final stages of viral maturation as profilin depleted cells fail to release infectious progeny virus Profilin binds to viral transcriptional proteins N and P but makes only a small contribution in viral transcription perhaps these interactions allow docking of the viral RNP complex to the actin filaments In contrast RSV induced actin stress fibers form only in some cells but not in others suggesting a nonessential role of stress fibers and an involvement of cell specific signaling molecules in this pathway Thus profilin is involved in virus mediated syncytium formation and stress fiber induction and in viral morphogenesis It remains to be seen whether these are due to profilin s ability to reorganize the cytoskeleton or due to a direct participation of profilin in these processes The determination of the various interactive domains of profilin and its partners in these pathways may allow one to design anti RSV drugs that will disrupt specific host virus interactions without extensive cytotoxicity Materials and Methods Clones proteins and antibodies His tagged P protein was expressed by IPTG mediated induction of a pET 15b RSV P Long clone in E coli BL21 DE3 The protein was soluble and was purified by standard Ni chelation chromatography 45 Purified recombinant profilin and antibodies against profilin RSV P protein and F protein have been described previously 11 25 Polyclonal antibodies to RSV proteins G N and M were purchased from Chemicon International Temecula CA and the corresponding rhodamine conjugated secondary antibody from Sigma The pcDNA3 clone of RSV P protein has been described earlier 21 the N gene was similarly cloned in this vector In transient transfection experiments optimal amounts of these DNA were transfected into monolayers grown cells using the Fugene 6 reagent Roche Diagnostics Indianapolis IN All RSV infections were carried out at an m o i of 3 using RSV Long grown on HEp 2 cells and purified as described previously 22 RNA interference and RT PCR analysis The anti profilin double stranded RNA siRNA of the following sequence were made by Dharmacon http www dharmacon com 5 AGAA G GTGTCCACGGTGGTdTdT 3 sense 5 ACCACCGTGGACACCTTCTdTdT 3 antisense The N 19 core of the sense strand 24 corresponded to nucleotide 348 366 of human profilin I ORF Accession No NM_005022 Transfection of monolayer cells with the siRNA and subsequent infection of the cells with RSV were carried out essentially as described 25 Interestingly after designing the siRNA and successfully using it to knock down profilin in rat cells we realized that the rat profilin sequence Accession No X96967 differs from the human sequence by one nucleotide the underlined G of human is A in rat The serendipitous success of the human siRNA against rat profilin suggested that small mismatch es may be tolerated in RNA interference the details of which will be published elsewhere Substantial tolerance of one or two nucleotide mismatch in siRNA mediated silencing of human coagulation trigger tissue factor mRNA has been reported recently 46 When siRNA transfected cells were infected with RSV the virus was added 10 hours after transfection RSV negative strand genomic RNA and N and F mRNA from infected cells were quantified by real time RT PCR using
