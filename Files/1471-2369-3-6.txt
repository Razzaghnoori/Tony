 Background The factors responsible for the age related incidence of post diarrheal hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS are unknown Clinical data indicate that the peak incidence of HUS occurs around two years of age but the disease clearly occurs in significant numbers of older children 1 Population based studies suggest that there is a decline in the incidence of HUS from a peak at age 1 2 years until a nadir at about age 11 years 1 2 In addition a case control study of the Washington State outbreak of HUS revealed that the mean age of patients with HUS was 8 years while the mean age of patients without HUS was 15 years 3 These studies raise the possibility therefore that the appearance or disappearance of a factor or factors in adolescents and adults reduces susceptibility to end organ injury in HUS HUS is thought to be due at least in large part to Shiga toxin Stx mediated cell toxicity 4 Since the kidney is a primary target of Stx in patients with HUS it has been hypothesized that the preferential renal injury occurring in children with HUS is related to heightened renal susceptibility to Stx in this age group Such increased renal sensitivity to Stx in children if it does indeed exist could be due to a wide variety of factors One immediately apparent factor that has been examined is age related alterations in renal Stx binding and Stx receptor galactose 1 4 galactose 1 4 glucose ceramide Gb3 expression An autopsy study determined that total kidney Gb3 levels were lower in infants than in adults although only two individuals under 19 years of age were examined 5 Another study using immunostaining of biopsy samples found that glomeruli from infants under two years of age but not from older children or adults bound Stx 6 This provocative finding albeit involving a relatively small sample size and patients who often had glomerulopathies provided a potential explanation for augmented glomerular Stx sensitivity in young children Confirmation of these observations is needed however they do suggest that Gb3 levels and in particular the pattern of renal Gb3 expression may be a factor in the age related incidence of renal injury in HUS The decreased incidence of HUS renal disease in adolescents and adults raises the possibility that factors associated with puberty may be involved There have been no studies to our knowledge that have examined the effects of puberty related hormonal alterations on renal cell sensitivity to Stx Indeed there is no information whatsoever on how any sex steroid affects Stx responsiveness of any cell type It seemed reasonable therefore to examine whether sex steroids estrogen progesterone and testosterone could modify the cytotoxic effect of Stx on renal cells Further since Gb3 levels may be altered with aging the effect of sex steroids on renal cell Gb3 expression was examined Several renal cell types have been demonstrated to respond to Stx Based on histologic evidence glomerular endothelial cells have been invoked as being primarily involved in HUS renal injury 7 In vitro studies have demonstrated that human glomerular endothelial cells HGEN bind Stx 1 and are modestly sensitive to the toxin s cytotoxic effect 8 Recent work indicates that other renal cell types may be Stx targets in HUS cultured human proximal tubule HPT 9 and human visceral glomerular epithelial HGEC 10 cells express abundant amounts of Gb3 and are highly sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of Stx 1 Consequently the current study examined the effect of sex steroids on Stx 1 cytotoxicity on and Gb3 expression by HGEN HGEC and HPT Methods Cell culture Primary cultures of HPT were obtained from Clonetics San Diego CA and studied at the third passage The identity and purity of these cultures was established by immunofluorescent staining as previously described 9 in addition to the extensive characterization by Clonetics we have determined that these cells lack von Willebrand factor and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecules PECAM but are positive for cytokeratin immunofluorescence and alkaline phosphatase activity HPT were maintained in 1 1 Dulbecco s Modified Eagle Media Ham

formaldehyde and solubilized in 1 acetic acid in 50 ethanol Absorption was read at 450 nm For determination of Gb3 content cells grown in 6 well plates were placed in serum free media for 24 hr followed by addition of the steroids for 1 2 or 7 days Gb3 was quantitated as previously described 9 Briefly cells were scraped off the plates centrifuged the pellet extracted in chloroform methanol

dependently killed HGEN HGEC and HPT Figure 1 In HGEN Stx 1 had an LD50 of about 10 5g L 140 pM while in HGEC the LD 50 for Stx was about 10 8 g L 140 fM and in HPT the LD 50 for Stx was about 10 9 5g L 4 4 fM Exposure for 1 2 or 7 days to high 1 M or physiologic concentrations reference range of physiologic steroid concentrations based on Barnes Hospital Laboratory Manual 11 of progesterone 30 nM estradiol 100 pM or testosterone 30 nM had no effect on HGEN Table 1 HGEC Table 2 or HPT Table 3 responsiveness to Stx 1 For the sake of brevity the tables illustrate the effect of 10 5 10 8 and 10 11g L Stx 1 however a full dose response from 10 5 10 11g L Stx 1 in ten fold concentration increments was done for each condition there was also no significant effect of these other concentrations of sex steroids on the cytotoxic effects of Stx 1 on any of the renal cell types In addition physiologic or pharmacologic concentrations of progesterone estradiol or testosterone had no effect on baseline without exposure to Stx 1 HGEN HGEC or HPT survival The effect of 1 2 or 7 days of exposure to physiologic or pharmacologic concentrations of progesterone estradiol or testosterone on Gb3 expression by HGEN HGEC or HPT was also examined A representative blot of Gb3 content is shown in Figure 2 figure illustrates 2 day steroid exposure in HPT to demonstrate that Gb3 isolated from cells migrated on the gel at the same position as purified Gb3 As for Stx cytotoxicity none of the steroids at any dose or exposure time modified Gb3 content in any cell type n 3 each condition data not shown Immunoreactive steroid concentration was determined in media samples at the start and conclusion of the 7 day experiment analyzed in clinical laboratory at Associated Regional University Pathologists Salt Lake City UT in order to determine the stability of the added steroids Estradiol and testosterone concentrations did not vary over 1 2 or 7 days in culture media Progesterone levels also did not fall after 1 2 days in culture media however after 7 days in media the progesterone concentration significantly dropped 80 decrease Consequently fresh progesterone was added to the 7 day experiments every two days The failure of steroids to affect Stx cytotoxicity was not due to inactivity of the steroid preparations Similar preparations and concentrations of steroids from the same supplier Sigma were tested by Dr Wayne Meikle in the Division of Endocrinology at the University of Utah using an in house estrogen and progesterone binding assay and a testosterone dependent stimulation of prostate cancer cell apoptosis assay 12 all the steroids retained biologic activity data not shown Discussion and Conclusion The reasons why HUS primarily affects children are unknown It is evident that the peak incidence of HUS occurs in very young children 1 2 years of age The factors responsible for this apparent heightened sensitivity to infection with Stx expressing bacteria have not been extensively investigated and were not examined in the current study Indeed it is conceivable that not all of the factors involved in HUS occurrence in young children are identical to those involved in the diminished HUS incidence in adolescents and adults Numerous factors could be involved in age related Stx sensitivity including differences in the degree of enteric invasion by Stx producing E coli in Stx transport across the gut in circulating red or white blood cell toxin binding and delivery to the kidney in the immune response to Stx in renal Stx binding and or in intrinsic or cofactor regulated e g inflammatory cytokines renal Stx responsiveness The current study evaluated one of these possibilities namely that renal cell Stx 1 responsiveness decreases with age due at least partially to hormonal changes associated with puberty As stated earlier there is no precedent in the literature for examination of the effect of sex steroids on Stx responsiveness however the coincidental fall in clinically apparent HUS in adolescents and adults 1 raises the possibility that hormonal changes associated with puberty induce a relatively Stx resistant state in the kidney HGEN HGEC and HPT were chosen for examination in this study because these cell types at least in vitro have been shown to be injured by Stx 1 6 7 8 Mesangial cells were not examined since Stx 1 has not been demonstrated to affect their viability 13 Previous studies have separately examined the cytotoxic effect of Stx 1 on HGEN 8 HGEC 10 and HPT 9 however this is the first study to directly compare Stx 1 sensitivity of these renal cell types These data indicate that as suggested from the previous studies within the limits of the cell culture system HPT are the most sensitive to Stx 1 cytotoxicity of the three cell types HGEC are slightly less sensitive and HGEN are at least three orders of magnitude less sensitive than either HGEC or HPT Such differential sensitivity is quite interesting particularly considering that glomerular endothelial cell damage is a prominent histologic feature in biopsies obtained from patients with clinically well established HUS 7 The significance of these observations remains therefore to be determined Although speculative it is tempting to propose that HPT and HGEC may be early targets of Stx 1 and that this could play a role in the pathophysiologic processes that characterize renal injury in HUS Estrogen progesterone or testosterone did not affect Stx 1 mediated renal cell cytotoxicity or Gb3 expression Cells were exposed to the steroids for up to one week in order to allow time for steroid regulated gene transcription and protein expression In addition both physiologic and pharmacologic concentrations of steroids were utilized Despite these efforts to be insure that the system was optimized in order to detect a steroid mediated alteration of Stx responsiveness the concern still exists that this system may not really reflect the influences of sex steroids in vivo Indeed one might argue that an animal model in which the testes or ovaries are removed and the animals are given Stx in the presence and absence of steroid replacement would be better Such studies would however be problematic Traditional animal models such as mice rats rabbits or pigs do not develop typical renal disease when given either Stx or E coli 0157 H7 14 Further animal models that most closely reflect human HUS are only in the early stages of development 14 Hence the cell culture system remains the most reasonable means to assess an effect of sex steroids on renal cell Stx 1 responsiveness such systems have clearly been demonstrated to be responsive to sex steroids e g testosterone regulated KAP promoter activity in proximal tubule cells 15 as well as estrogen regulated endothelial cell function 16 Given these limitations our data suggest that sex steroids do not alter renal cell sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of this Stx 1 Consequently the reasons why clinically apparent HUS primarily occurs in children remains to be determined List of Abbreviations HUS hemolytic uremic syndrome HGEN human glomerular
