 Background The functional annotation of metazoan genome sequences represents one of the greatest challenges in modern biological research For example even with structural constraints imposed by the genetic code to guide algorithm design the identification of all protein coding genes in a metazoan genome remains an unsolved computational problem The identification of functional non coding sequences such as untranslated regions UTRs genes for non protein coding RNAs and cis regulatory elements poses an even more difficult problem for comprehensive genome annotation as the rules governing their structure and function remain more elusive Despite these difficulties it is increasingly clear that comparative genomic approaches will substantially aid efforts to annotate these and other important sequence features With whole genome sequence data quickly becoming available for several organisms it is important to determine which species comparisons and features of genome evolution will be most useful for comparative genome annotation The genus Drosophila offers a well characterized evolutionary genetic system for developing and testing methods for comparative genome annotation From the seminal population genetic and phylogenetic studies of Dobzhansky and co workers 1 and the classification of taxonomic relationships in the genus by Patterson Stone and others 2 Drosophila has long served as a model system for developing and testing evolutionary principles at the morphological and cytological levels The genus Drosophila has also served as a proving ground for developing and testing evolutionary principles at the protein 3 and DNA sequence levels 4 In addition for over a decade and a half comparative sequence analysis has had an important role in the functional analysis of genes and cis regulatory sequences in Drosophila see for example 5 6 This history of research has culminated in a rich understanding of the pattern and process of molecular evolution in the genus Drosophila 7 With the complete sequencing of the euchromatic portion of the Drosophila melanogaster genome 8 9 this prior knowledge can be applied to the task of comparative genome annotation We have undertaken a pilot study to assess the contribution of large scale comparative genomic sequence data on the functional annotation of the Drosophila genome Our goals are to identify the species whose genome sequences would be most useful in annotating the D melanogaster genome and to identify features of genome evolution that can assist the annotation of protein coding genes and the non coding cis regulatory sequences controlling their transcription The lessons learned from this study have implications for efforts to annotate the entire D melanogaster genome using comparative sequence data from the forthcoming D pseudoobscura genome 10 as well as the recently completed Anopheles gambiae genome 11 Beyond the initial analyses presented here these data also serve as materials for the further study of molecular evolutionary processes in Drosophila and the calibration of comparative sequence analysis tools Here we report the isolation and analysis of genomic sequences from eight candidate regions representing both gene rich and gene poor regions of the Drosophila genome totaling over 1 25 megabases Mb of DNA sequence These regions were isolated from fosmid libraries of four divergent Drosophila species D erecta D pseudoobscura D willistoni and D littoralis chosen to cover a range of divergence times 6 15 46 53 and 61 65 million years respectively from the reference species D melanogaster 7 Using the annotation pipeline and curation tools described in accompanying papers 12 13 14 we predicted the coding sequence content of these sequences for subsequent comparative analyses Our results indicate that the majority of coding sequences predicted in D melanogaster can be identified in divergent Drosophila species and show evidence of functional constraint Microsynteny is generally maintained at the scale of individual fosmid clones and the few rearrangement breakpoints transposable elements and gene transpositions can readily be identified Analysis of coding sequence evolution suggests that uncharacterized genes which we will refer to as predicted genes tend to have a higher rate of protein evolution than known genes those genes that have been selected for experimental study and thus are more likely to have easily discerned functions Analysis of non coding sequence evolution reveals that levels of conservation vary with divergence time and that conserved non coding sequences CNCSs exhibit a striking pattern of spatial clustering in Drosophila Using transgenic reporter assays we show that CNCS clusters can be used to accurately predict a developmentally regulated enhancer in the apterous ap region We discuss the implications of our results for comparative approaches to protein coding and cis regulatory sequence prediction in the genus Drosophila Results Isolation and sequencing of genomic regions from divergent Drosophilaspecies On the basis of genome size considerations and the desire to investigate a range of divergence times in the genus Drosophila we constructed fosmid libraries approximately 40 kb inserts for D erecta D pseudoobscura D willistoni and D littoralis Figure 1 D littoralis is closely related to the well studied species D virilis but has been reported to have less dispersed repetitive DNA than D virilis Kevin White personal communication We designed degenerate PCR primers for a set of eight well characterized genes apterous ap even skipped eve fushi tarazu ftz twist twi and Rhodopsins 1 2 3 and 4 Rh1 Rh2 Rh3 and Rh4 to obtain species specific sequence tagged sites STSs that were subsequently used for hybridization to gridded fosmid filters see Materials and methods Positive clones from the library screen were verified by PCR and restriction mapped to choose the longest clone containing the candidate gene and its regulatory regions In the initial design of this project comparative sequence data was to be collected from a D virilis P1 library 15 Using a PCR based plate pool screening strategy we isolated a P1 clone from this library containing an 83 2 kb insert from the ap region of D virilis Sequencing of this clone revealed long stretches of repetitive DNA which complicated both assembly and comparative analyses In addition the insert size of the D virilis P1 library approximately 60 80 kb was greater than necessary for comparative analysis of single gene regions This clone was used to guide transgenic reporter analysis see below but has not been included in the other analyses reported here In total 30 fosmid clones were isolated and sequenced using methods described in 9 which sum to 1 257 069 bp All clones were finished to an estimated error rate of fewer than 0 17 errors per 10 kb with an average estimated error rate of 0 03 errors per 10 kb The lengths of fosmids sequenced for the eight candidate regions are shown in Table 1 Though we were able to obtain species specific STSs for the D willistoni twi gene we were not able to obtain clones for this region from the D willistoni fosmid library We were also not able to obtain a species specific probe for D willistoni ftz nor could we obtain any D willistoni ftz clones using probes from other non melanogaster species Also shown in Table 1are the lengths and locations of D melanogaster genomic regions corresponding to the union of the Release 3 sequences homologous to all four non melanogaster species The union of sequences from all non melanogaster species for the eight candidate regions covers 494 6 kb of the D melanogaster genome an additional 65 3 kb of D melanogaster genomic sequence was sampled owing to rearrangements in non melanogaster species Thus the 1 25 Mb of comparative data presented here span over 0 5 Mb of coding and non coding sequences of the D melanogaster genome Comparative annotation of coding sequences The 30 non melanogaster fosmid and the D virilis ap P1 sequences were computationally processed using the pipeline used to re annotate the D melanogaster genome 12 The only major modification to this pipeline was to add an additional tier of evidence containing the results of TBLASTN searches of all Release 3 D melanogaster peptides 14 against non melanogaster sequences Predicted coding sequences were manually verified and refined using the Apollo annotation tool 13 As no expressed sequence tag EST information exists to annotate transcribed non coding sequences such as UTRs for the four non melanogaster species we annotated only protein coding gene and exon models Thus in keeping with other gene prediction studies for example 16 we use the terms gene and exon to refer to the translated components of genes and exons In the 30 fosmids we predict a total of 164 protein coding genes in non melanogaster species 53 in D erecta 41 in D pseudoobscura 39 in D willistoni 31 in D littoralis that form orthologous clusters with 81 D melanogaster genes Of the 81 genes 30 are known genes that have been functionally characterized in some way by the community of Drosophila researchers the remaining 51 genes are predicted genes based only on the evidence in the Release 3 annotations 14 and see Supplementary Table 1 in the Additional data files section Of the 164 genes predicted in non melanogaster species 133 81 are full length the remaining 31 19 are partial coding sequences that span the edge of the sequenced genomic clone In non melanogaster species we predict 495 coding exons 148 in D erecta 133 in D pseudoobscura 111 in D willistoni 103 in D littoralis that form orthologous clusters with 264 D melanogaster coding exons On average there are approximately two non melanogaster species sampled per orthologous gene and coding exon cluster Fifteen genes 10 complete and 39 coding exons were sequenced in all four non melanogaster species Qualitatively our data reveal that the majority of D melanogaster Release 3 gene models are highly conserved in divergent Drosophila species This made it possible to automatically identify orthologous genes in non melanogaster species using TBLASTN results in conjunction with Genie 17 and or GENSCAN 18 predictions to improve intron exon boundaries and identify small divergent exons in Apollo In the few discrepant cases where no clear ortholog could be unambiguously identified such as the four closely related members of the Rhodopsin gene family we used the conserved microsyntenic gene orders maintained in these species to resolve orthologs see below With the exception of the retrotransposition events discussed below the intron exon structure of gene models is highly conserved as well only one case of intron gain was observed in the D littoralis Rh2 as has been reported previously for Rh2 in the closely related species D virilis 19 For a small class of genes BcDNA LD21213 Gr59a Gr59b CG9895 CG10887 CG17186 CG4733 orthologs could be identified in divergent species but amino acid sequences could not be reliably aligned with the D melanogaster gene model In addition orthologs of four genes CG13029 CG14294 CG12133 CG12378 could not be identified in non melanogaster species except in D erecta the species most closely related to D melanogaster The absence of these genes is not simply due to insufficient sampling since in these cases both 5 and 3 neighboring genes could be identified in more divergent species see Figure 2 for example These may represent genes overpredicted in both D erecta and D melanogaster lineage specific genes which evolved before the divergence of D melanogaster from D erecta or genes which have transposed from or to other locations in the genomes of the more divergent species We used an evolutionary genetic approach the K a K s test to assess the accuracy of these gene and exon predictions 20 This test relies on the assumption that functionally constrained protein coding sequences should exhibit significantly lower rates of evolution in amino acid encoding nucleotide sites typically first and second positions in a codon relative to silent sites typically third positions in a codon Quantitatively this leads to the prediction that the ratio of the average rate of amino acid substitution per site K a relative to the average rate of silent substitution per site K s for functionally constrained coding sequences should be significantly less than 1 21 Genes or exons which have a K a K s 1 are inferred to evolve in the absence of functional constraint genes or exons which have a K a K s 1 are inferred to evolve under the influence of positive selection The significance of a K a K s ratio can be determined by a likelihood ratio test of the probabilities of the data under the alternative hypotheses of functional constraint relative to no constraint 22 Genes or coding exons with a K a K s ratio significantly less than 1 pass the K a K s test genes or coding exons with a K a K s ratio not significantly less than 1 fail the K a K s test The power of this test to detect functional constraint is influenced both by evolutionary distance and sequence length 20 thus we analyzed both genes and coding exons in pairwise comparison with all four non melanogaster species All pairwise gene level comparisons studied here exhibited K a K s ratios less than one see Supplementary Table 1 in the Additional data files section One hundred and fifty five of 164 94 5 of these K a K s ratios were significantly less than 1 indicating that the vast majority of genes in our sample show evidence of functional constraint All nine pairwise comparisons that fail the K a K s test at the gene level were D melanogaster D erecta comparisons and eight out of nine involved predicted genes Supplementary Table 1 Genomic sequences for six of the nine genes which fail the K a K s test at the gene level were sampled in more divergent species four of these six genes could be identified in more divergent species Lmpt CG10887 CG14292 and CG4468 whereas two could not CG12378 and CG14294 indicating that genes conserved in divergent species can fail gene level K a K s tests in comparisons among closely related species like D erecta Of the four genes identified only in D melanogaster and D erecta and not in more distantly related species two pass CG12133 and CG13029 and two fail CG12378 and CG14294 the gene level K a K s test We note that of these four genes the two genes that pass CG12133 and CG13029 have multiple exons whereas the two genes that fail CG12378 and CG14294 have only a single exon This result indicates that at least some of the genes found only in D melanogaster and D erecta are likely to be real genes under functional constraint Though the majority of pairwise exon level comparisons have K a K s ratios less than one Figure 3 a much lower proportion of pairwise comparisons at the exon level pass the K a K s test In total 71 9 356 495 of pairwise comparisons at the exon level pass the K a K s test 54 0 80 148 for D erecta 78 9 105 133 for D pseudoobscura 81 1 90 111 for D willistoni and 79 6 82 103 for D littoralis Coding exons from known and predicted genes pass the K a K s test at similar rates overall 72 2 known versus 71 1 predicted D erecta 56 6 known versus 50 0 predicted D pseudoobscura 80 4 known versus 75 6 predicted D willistoni 81 5 known versus 82 1 predicted D littoralis 78 0 known versus 80 6 predicted The majority of exons that fail the K a K s test still have K a K s ratios less than 1 only six non significant pairwise exon comparisons one in D erecta one in D pseudoobscura two in D willistoni and two in D littoralis have K a K s ratios greater than 1 Figure 3 As with gene level comparisons the most closely related species D erecta fails the highest proportion of exon level K a K s tests In contrast to gene level comparisons there is no tendency for exons from predicted genes to fail K a K s tests relative to exons from known genes Pairwise comparisons that do not pass the K a K s test could result from misannotated exons or an insufficient amount of divergence to resolve differential rates of amino acid and silent site evolution Failure to pass exon level K a K s tests because of insufficient divergence is a function of divergence time and exon length 20 Our results suggest that both factors contribute to non significant exon level K a K s tests between species in the genus Drosophila The fact that the most closely related species D erecta fails the highest proportion of gene and exon level K a K s tests indicates that insufficient divergence time contributes to non significant comparisons Exon length is also a factor as there is a tendency for shorter exons to fail K a K s tests in our data For example the average length of all exons failing the K a K s test in comparisons between D melanogaster and D pseudoobscura is 22 1 codons and the average length of all exons passing the K a K s test is 152 1 codons Similar results are obtained for pairwise comparisons involving D melanogaster and D erecta D willistoni or D littoralis and for both known and predicted genes data not shown To determine if insufficient divergence time is the major cause of non significant exon level K a K s tests we performed multi species exon level K a K s tests that capitalize on a greater total amount of divergence for a given exon 20 The question addressed by this analysis is does the addition of a third species to D melanogaster D pseudoobscura pairwise comparisons increase the proportion of exons that pass exon level K a K s tests For this analysis we analyzed exons that failed pairwise tests between D melanogaster and D pseudoobscura using triplets involving D melanogaster D pseudoobscura and one other non melanogaster species Using the same cutoffs for the pairwise exon level analyses and a guide tree based on Figure 1 we tested 16 14 and 13 exons which did not show evidence of functional constraint between D melanogaster and D pseudoobscura for which we have sequence data available in D erecta D willistoni and D littoralis respectively Only 2 of the 16 12 5 non significant exon level D melanogaster D pseudoobscura comparisons pass the K a K s test when D erecta is included as a third species whereas 6 of 14 42 8 and 6 of 13 46 1 pass when D willistoni and D littoralis are included as a third species respectively These results demonstrate that multiple comparisons among divergent species can reveal functional constraint acting on coding exons that cannot otherwise be detected in pairwise comparisons Finally as a preliminary assessment of the relative utility of A gambiae genome sequences for comparative gene prediction in Drosophila we attempted to identify homologs in A gambiae of the 81 genes for which we have comparative sequence data in Drosophila For 21 of the 81 genes in our study 25 9 we were not able to obtain a clear homolog defined as a high scoring pair HSP with an expected E value less than 10 20and greater than or equal to 30 identity over 100 amino acids using default parameters of TBLASTN in the A gambiae mapped scaffold sequences 11 of these 21 genes did not yield any HSPs at all These results are compatible with a recent whole genome analysis showing that 18 6 of D melanogaster genes have no clear homolog in A gambiae 23 No clear homolog could be identified in the A gambiae genome sequences for three of 30 10 0 known genes in our dataset whereas a greater than three times higher proportion of predicted genes 18 of 51 35 3 had no clear homolog in A gambiae Five D melanogaster genes the four members of the Rhodopsin gene family and CG5245 have multiple HSPs in the A gambiae genome sequences We were able to resolve orthology for Rh4 only as the sina gene in A gambiae is contained within the Rh4 gene as in D melanogaster and other species in the subgenus Sophophora Rearrangement and transposition of genomic sequences Using the gene predictions discussed above as orthologous markers we addressed the question of whether the microsyntenic relationships in the D melanogaster genomic sequence surveyed are conserved in non melanogaster species In general our data indicate that the microsyntenic order of coding and non coding sequences is highly conserved in the genus Drosophila at the scale of individual fosmids approximately 40 kb Our data provide evidence for only six genomic rearrangements in these sequences occurring in the phylogeny of these five species one each in the lineages leading to the D littoralis ftz D pseudoobscura Rh1 D willistoni eve Rh1 and Rh3 regions as well as in the ancestor of the D melanogaster D erecta eve region see Figure 1 All of these unique events occurred in non coding intergenic regions and none of the rearrangement breakpoints is associated with detectable transposable element sequences see also 24 Although it is difficult to estimate the length distribution of microsyntenic regions in Drosophila from our data it is clear that very small microsyntenic regions can be delimited in the Drosophila genome through multiple species comparisons For example the two independent rearrangements in the vicinity of the eve locus reduce this microsyntenic region to a approximately 20 kb interval of the D melanogaster genome containing only three neighboring genes Adam CG12134 and eve and their flanking non coding sequences Figure 2 We can directly confirm the nature of one rearrangement D littoralis ftz as a paracentric micro inversion since both breakpoints are contained within a single fosmid clone In this case a small approximately 14 kb region containing the ftz coding sequence and flanking non coding DNA is inverted between the Antp and Scr genes relative to D melanogaster Maier et al 25 provide hybrization data for a similar rearrangement in the ftz locus of D hydei another member of the subgenus Drosophila It is likely that the other rearrangement breakpoints we observe also result from paracentric inversions the predominant form of genome rearrangement in Drosophila 26 Consistent with this is the fact that rearranged sequences can be inferred to come from the same chromosome arm At least two other breakpoints in the D willistoni Rh1 and Rh3 regions also have probably arisen from micro inversions as in both cases only two genes are inferred to have switched order locally on the chromosome We also identified eight examples of novel genetic elements in non melanogaster species seven of which occur in intergenic regions Figure 1 Four of these cases involve the insertion of novel transposable element sequences full length Bari 1 like elements in both the D pseudoobscura Rh1 region and the D willistoni Rh3 regions a partial I like element in the D willistoni Rh4 region and a partial blastopia like element in the D littoralis Rh3 region Identification of Bari 1 like transposon sequences in D pseudoobscura and D willistoni is consistent with previous observations 27 I like elements have been shown to exist in the melanogaster and obscura species 28 but this is the first report of I like elements in the willistoni group The other four cases arise from gene transposition including a homolog of the D melanogaster X chromosome gene CG2222 in the D willistoni eve region a homolog of the D melanogaster 3R chromosome gene CG5245 in the D pseudoobscura Rh1 region a homolog of the D melanogaster 3R chromosome gene CG8319 in the D willistoni Rh1 region and the Rh4 gene in D littoralis see below The CG5245 like gene in D pseudoobscura and the CG8319 like gene in D willistoni both are located in the same intergenic region between the Arc42 and PK92B genes but result from independent events since they involve different ancestral sequences and occur on opposite strands in this intergenic region This result suggests the possibility of hotspots for gene transposition in the Drosophila genome At least one novel gene the CG2222 like gene D willistoni is likely to have originated from a retrotransposition event as this gene lacks introns while its closest homolog found on a different chromosome arm in the D melanogaster genome has two introns Another striking example of retrotransposition involves the D littoralis Rh4 gene and illustrates the fact that functionally important genes can undergo dramatic changes in location and gene structure during genome evolution 29 This gene maintains its microsyntenic relationship with neighboring genes in the 72D2 3 region of the D melanogaster genome in Sophophoran species but has retrotransposed into the intron of another gene CG10967 in a region of the D littoralis genome that corresponds to the 69E1 2 region of the D melanogaster genome As a result genes contained in the intron of the Sophophoran Rh4 sina CG13030 and CG13029 have been lost in the process Cytological evidence for transposition of Rh4 exists for the closely related species D virilis and the more distantly related species D repleta 29 30 In contrast to the stability of microsyntenic gene order in the genus Drosophila we found that the sample of genes studied here are scattered widely throughout the Anopheles genome For example of the 55 Drosophila genes that had a single clear homolog in Anopheles 27 are located on D melanogaster chromosome arm 2R Of these 27 genes ten five six and six are located on A gambiae chromosome arms 2L 2R 3L and 3R These results are consistent with previous reports comparing the locations of genes in D melanogaster with A gambiae which indicate that extensive genome rearrangement has occurred since the divergence of these two lineages 23 31 32 Some D melanogaster genes in our sample do maintain microsyntenic relationships in A gambiae such as the Rh4 and sina genes In this case conservation of microsynteny is most probably maintained because of the nested relationship of these genes and this configuration in the outgroup Anopheles supports the scenario that transposition of Rh4 occurred at some point in the lineage leading to the Drosophila subgenus see above and 29 30 Patterns of coding sequence evolution In addition to providing a useful resource for studying comparative gene prediction and genome rearrangements our data confirm and extend emerging trends in Drosophila coding sequence evolution Table 2summarizes the average rates of amino acid and silent site substitution for all known and predicted genes in our dataset These data show that predicted genes tend to have a higher rate of amino acid substitution than known genes in the genus Drosophila This trend is significant for the three most closely related pairwise comparisons D melanogaster versus D erecta D pseudoobscura or D willistoni but non significant in the comparison involving the most distantly related species D melanogaster versus D littoralis No significant differences were detected in the rates of silent site substitution between known and predicted genes in any pairwise comparison although predicted genes in D pseudoobscura D willistoni and D littoralis tend to show elevated rates of silent site substitution In contrast to expectation average rates of amino acid substitution are highest in comparisons between D melanogaster and D willistoni not D melanogaster and D littoralis Table 2 Figure 1 The overall increased rate of amino acid substitution for genes in the D willistoni lineage is caused by an increased rate of amino acid substitution in predicted genes For known genes average rates of amino acid substitution are consistent with the accepted phylogenetic relationships of these species D erecta is most closely related to D melanogaster followed by D pseudoobscura D willistoni and D littoralis respectively Average rates of silent site substitution also do not show a pattern consistent with the accepted phylogeny of these species Table 2 Figure 1 This is a consequence of the fact that for comparisons between D melanogaster and either D pseudoobscura D willistoni or D littoralis average rates of silent site substitution exceed an expectation of one substitution per site indicating that silent sites are saturated in these comparisons Even so it is apparent that there may be an increased rate of silent site substitution as well in the D willistoni lineage It is unlikely that these results are simply a consequence of an incorrect phylogeny since the phylogenetic relationships of these species are well established 7 Our estimate of the average rate of amino acid substitution per site in known genes between D melanogaster and D pseudoobscura 0 071 is nearly the same as previous estimates 0 076 using a different sample of known genes and estimation procedure 33 In addition our estimate of the average rate of amino acid substitution for predicted genes between D melanogaster and D erecta 0 071 is similar to that estimated using different methods for a sample of rapidly evolving genes between D melanogaster and D yakuba 0 067 34 a species approximately as divergent from D melanogaster as D erecta 35 Thus the categorical and lineage effects we detect are unlikely to be artifacts of our data or methods The cause s of the increased rate of amino acid substitution in predicted genes in the D willistoni lineage remain to be clarified but are most probably related to increased rates of protein evolution detected previously in the D saltans lineage 36 which have been explained by a shift in base composition in the common ancestor of the D saltans and D willistoni groups see below and 37 In D melanogaster it is well established that coding sequences have a higher GC content relative to genomic averages due to the preferential use of codons ending in C or G 38 39 This pattern holds in the closely related species D erecta as well as in the more distantly related species D pseudoobscura and D littoralis Table 3 In contrast our data show that D willistoni coding sequences have a higher frequency of AT 53 base pairs than GC 47 base pairs This shift in base usage in D willistoni coding sequences is apparent at the dinucelotide level as well predominantly affecting those dinucleotides that exclusively contain AT or GC Non coding sequences of all non melanogaster species are AT rich as in D melanogaster 40 slight shifts towards higher AT frequency are observed in the non coding sequences of the D willistoni lineage Table 3 The shift in base usage in the D willistoni lineage is also detected in the pattern of synonymous codon usage see Supplementary Table 2 in the additional data files Previous analyses of a limited number of coding sequences revealed a shift away from preferred C ending codons used in the D melanogaster lineage towards T ending codons in the D willistoni lineage 7 41 Our data indicate that this trend holds for a much larger sample of genes see Supplementary Table 2 in additional data files For 10 of the 18 amino acids with more than one codon Arg Asn His Ile Leu Lys Phe Pro Thr Tyr the most frequently used codon in D willistoni differs from that in D melanogaster All 10 of these changes in synonymous codon usage involve D willistoni most frequently using an A or T ending or beginning for example Leu codon with D melanogaster using a G or C ending or beginning codon supporting a trend identified originally using only the Adh coding sequence 41 The most frequently used codon differs between D melanogaster and D erecta D pseudoobscura and D littoralis for only two Asp Ser one Asn and four Asn Ile Pro Thr amino acids respectively Patterns of non coding sequence evolution Our data also provide an opportunity to study basic features of non coding conservation in Drosophila which remain largely unexplored As shown in Figures 2and 4 a substantial proportion of non coding sequences are conserved in Drosophila especially in pairwise comparisons between D melanogaster and D erecta Levels of conservation appear to plateau in more divergent comparisons with a tendency for D pseudoobscura to show higher levels of non coding conservation relative to D willistoni or D littoralis in pairwise comparisons with D melanogaster Few if any non coding sequences are conserved between D melanogaster and A gambiae Figure 4 see also 23 There is also regional variation in levels of non coding conservation in the Drosophila genome as illustrated by contrasting conservation between D melanogaster and D erecta for example in the eve Figure 2 and ap Figure 4 regions To estimate levels of sequence conservation in non coding regions and to contrast patterns of coding with non coding conservation we aligned genomic sequences using the AVID alignment tool 42 AVID is a global alignment tool that works by recursively finding co linear anchors of maximal sequence identity therefore locally inverted or transposed sequences that might be conserved will not be included in our analysis Conserved non coding sequences CNCSs defined as windows of 10 bp or greater with 90 or greater nucleotide identity were identified in pairwise alignments using the VISTA program 43 These parameters were chosen to identify short highly conserved sequences found in Drosophila non coding regions 44 We used D melanogaster as the reference species in pairwise comparisons with non melanogaster species and Release 3 annotations 14 exported from Gadfly in VISTA format to classify conserved segments as either coding or non coding Transcribed and nontranscribed non coding sequences were analyzed together since previous results showed similar patterns of conservation for intergenic and intronic sequences in Drosophila 44 The results of this analysis are shown in Table 4 which contrasts features of conservation in both coding and non coding sequences by species For all species analyzed coding regions have a higher proportion of sequences that meet our definition of conservation relative to non coding sequences In addition the median segment length surpassing our criterion for conservation is longer for coding sequences relative to non coding sequences for all species analyzed These results are expected as coding sequences are on average thought to experience more intense purifying selection than non coding sequences 21 In contrast the average percent identity of conserved segments is higher for non coding sequences than coding sequences This is probably a result of silent site substitution in otherwise functionally constrained coding sequences Analysis of levels of conservation by species shows that the increased rate of amino acid sequence evolution in the D willistoni lineage detected above may reflect a more widespread phenomenon in the genome of this species As shown in Table 4 D willistoni shows unexpectedly low levels of both non coding and coding conservation given the accepted phylogeny of the species These data show that the increased rate of evolution in the D willistoni lineage is not restricted to coding sequences rendering coding sequence based interpretations of the unusual patterns of molecular evolution in this lineage less tenable see for example 7 41 Together with the changes in base composition in both coding and non coding sequences noted above the increased rate of evolution in both coding and non coding sequences detected in the D willistoni suggests a genome wide effect possibly resulting from a change in mutation pressure or a change in population size at some time during the history of this lineage see also 37 Despite the lineage effect in levels of conservation in the D willistoni genome the median length of conserved coding or non coding segments generally decreases with increasing divergence time as expected Table 4 However the average percent identity of conserved coding or non coding segments identified does not decrease with increasing divergence time Finally the ratio of conserved sequences that are coding relative to non coding increases with increasing divergence time The ratio of conserved sequences that are coding relative to non coding is 1 36 for comparisons with D erecta but increases to 2 21 for comparisons involving D pseudoobscura and approximately 3 5 for comparisons involving D willistoni or D littoralis Changes in the median CNCS length reflect changes in the overall distribution of CNCS lengths in pairwise comparisons between D melanogaster and either D erecta D pseudoobscura D willistoni or D littoralis Figure 5 These data quantitatively describe the pattern of non coding conservation shown in Figures 2and 4 CNCS lengths become shorter with increasing divergence but plateau to approximately the same length in the most distant comparisons The stability of this distribution at more extreme evolutionary distances is apparently insensitive to changes in the proportion of non coding DNA that is conserved compare D willistoni and D littoralis Shown for comparison is the distribution of CNCS lengths between D melanogaster and D virilis from 44 as well as a reanalysis of this data using the current methods Differences between the present and previous results for the D virilis data show the effect of different methods for detecting CNCSs The differences observed in the distribution of CNCS lengths between the closely related species D virilis and D littoralis using the AVID VISTA method reflect the fact that the D virilis data were obtained from non coding regions with known or suspected cis regulatory function whereas the data here represent a more random sampling of non coding regions in the Drosophila genome Conservation of non coding sequences is typically interpreted as evidence of functional constraint and this assumption underlies most phylogenetic footprinting methods This assumption was questioned by Clark 45 who proposed an alternative hypothesis for non coding conservation based on heterogeneity in mutation rates that is mutational cold spots To resolve these alternatives we studied the spatial distribution and conservation of spacing between CNCSs in the Drosophila genome Under a simple mutational cold spot hypothesis CNCSs should occur randomly in non coding DNA and the lengths of spacer intervals between CNCSs should be exponentially distributed 46 47 In addition there should be no tendency for the spacing between mutational cold spots to remain conserved between divergent Drosophila species given the rapid rate of DNA loss in unconstrained sequences in the Drosophila genome 48 49 As shown in Figure 6for non coding comparisons between D melanogaster and D pseudoobscura the frequency spacer interval lengths between CNCSs in the D melanogaster genome differ significantly from the exponential distribution The deviation from expected results from an excess of short and long spacer intervals indicating that CNCSs are clustered in the Drosophila genome Non random spacing of CNCSs is also observed in other pairwise species comparisons in the genus Drosophila 46 and data not shown In addition the lengths of homologous spacer intervals are highly correlated across species Figure 7 This correlation is unlikely to be an artifact of alignment as the AVID method first aligns regions of local similarity before generating a global alignment Moreover similar results have been obtained using non global alignment methods 46 These results suggest that spacer interval sequences between CNCSs and therefore CNCSs themselves are functionally constrained and provide evidence against the hypothesis that CNCSs are simply mutational cold spots Clusters of CNCSs are readily apparent in VISTA plots of complex gene regions with known cis regulatory function Figures 2and 4 In addition there is a strong tendency for known cis regulatory elements to overlap clusters of CNCSs For example discrete enhancers that control embryonic expression of eve are contained within discrete CNCS clusters in the region 5 to eve Figure 2 In contrast discrete CNCSs clusters are not observed in the region 3 to eve where enhancers overlap one another 50 51 The correspondence of CNCS clusters and functional enhancers is observed in other regions of the Drosophila genome such as the discrete muscle specific enhancer in the fourth intron of ap Figure 4 The inexact correspondence between enhancer sequences and CNCS clusters is perhaps not unexpected as enhancers are typically defined as the minimal sequence sufficient to recapitulate native expression in a reporter gene assay Nevertheless this pattern suggests a functional relationship between cis regulatory elements and discrete CNCS clusters To test the hypothesis that CNCS clusters can predict the location of cis regulatory elements in the Drosophila genome we carried out P element mediated reporter gene analysis of genomic sequences corresponding to a CNCS cluster in the fourth intron of ap This CNCS cluster is apparent in pairwise comparisons between D melanogaster and D pseudoobscura as well as between D melanogaster and D virilis Figure 4 ap is a LIM homeobox transcription factor expressed in many tissues in Drosophila including embryonic expression in the developing brain 52 53 As shown in Figure 8 the D melanogaster genomic sequences corresponding to the CNCS cluster in the ap intron 4 drives reporter gene expression in the Drosophila embryo in a specific pattern that recapitulates native ap expression in the developing brain In addition when introduced into the genome of D melanogaster the homologous fragment from the D virilis genome also drives reporter gene expression in the same pattern indicating that the expression pattern resulting from this enhancer has been conserved since the divergence of these two species Experiments to test the function of CNCS clusters 1 2 and 3 in the ap region are currently underway Discussion Prospects for comparative gene prediction in Drosophila Although great progress has been made towards understanding the protein coding component of eukaryotic genome sequences 54 55 56 57 comprehensive genome annotation is far from complete in any metazoan State of the art statistical and remote homology gene prediction methods are successful at identifying the location of exons in unannotated genomic DNA but are often quite poor at predicting the details of gene structure necessitating human curation 14 One of the most useful sources of information for accurately predicting complex gene structures is EST cDNA data 58 Predicting the structure of genes for which no EST cDNA data exists will require alternative approaches such as comparative gene modeling among divergent species with conserved proteomes in the same group of organisms The results of our K a K s analyses presented here give preliminary insight into the prospects of comparative gene modeling using large scale sequence data in the genus Drosophila From our findings we expect that structural details of most Release 3 coding sequences can be verified and improved using pairwise sequence data between divergent species like D melanogaster and D pseudoobscura Our results also indicate that although it may not be necessary for many genes in the D melanogaster genome de novo comparative gene prediction between these species will find the vast majority of as yet unidentified genes lacking EST cDNA data It is important to note that we do not expect to detect all coding exons especially short exons 20 in pairwise comparisons highlighting the added value of multiple species data for comparative exon prediction In addition important details of gene models will prove difficult to predict using only comparative data as amino acid divergence especially insertions or deletions can obscure intron exon boundaries and other details of gene structure Moreover there is inherent uncertainty in the correct gene structure developed from comparative data alone since two divergent sequences are simultaneously being modeled Finally the comparative annotation of UTR sequences awaits the development of methods that accurately predict the non coding components of gene models The patterns of protein coding sequence evolution detected in our data have important implications for comparative gene prediction Most notably the trend we detect for predicted genes to show an increased rate of amino acid substitution relative to known genes is important as it may reflect differences in functional constraint or quality of gene models between the two classes of genes For at least three reasons we believe that the elevated rate of amino acid substitution in predicted genes is not a result of poor quality gene models in this class of genes First many of the genes in the predicted class have EST cDNA data see Supplementary Table 1 so the details of these gene models are likely to be correct Second estimates of K a and K s are based on aligned sequences thus gross inaccuracies in gene models that would create gaps in the alignment are excluded from estimates of evolutionary rates Third differential rates in these two classes of genes maybe expected as a high proportion of known genes were selected for study because their mutational inactivation resulted in an obvious phenotype Thus we favor the interpretation that increased rates of amino acid substitution in predicted genes results from lower levels of functional constraint If this interpretation is correct our results confirm those of Schmid and co workers 34 59 who have shown that a large fraction of randomly sampled coding sequences and orphan genes are rapidly evolving in the genus Drosophila Our results are also consistent with those of Ashburner et al 60 who show that genes with known mutant phenotypes in D melanogaster are more likely to have a conserved homolog in GenBank relative to predicted genes with no known phenotype Similarly Zdobnov et al 23 show that D melanogaster orphan genes tend to exhibit lower levels of conservation in pairwise comparison with A gambiae 23 Finally the interpretation that known and predicted genes differ in their levels of functional constraint is supported by the fact that increased rates of protein evolution in D willistoni affect predicted genes more strongly than known genes Table 2 Together these results suggest that there is a large class of functional protein coding sequences evolving under weak selective constraint in the Drosophila genome 34 Rates of evolution for this class of genes may be too fast to allow the identification of homologs from extremely divergent species such as Anopheles for comparative gene prediction but slow enough to use comparative data within the genus Drosophila Rearrangement transposition and genome annotation Genome rearrangement in Drosophila typically occurs through paracentric inversion allowing the homology of chromosome arms to be maintained over millions of years Homologous chromosome arms in the genus Drosophila are referred to as Muller s elements and represent a clearly established level of synteny between species 7 The homology of Muller s elements can be extended to A gambiae 23 31 however it is clear that a substantial fraction of rearrangements between these species must occur by other mechanisms than paracentric inversion Levels of synteny below the chromosome arm are more difficult to establish and the description of these levels of conserved gene order is currently arbitrary 23 Thus it is important to point out that the strictly co linear microsynteny we detect between Drosophila species differs from the hyphenated microsynteny with multiple gene losses and gains between Drosophila and Anopheles 32 Rates of genome rearrangement between species in the genus Drosophila based on cytological evidence are thought to be among the highest for any metazoan 61 Before this study only a single fixed inversion breakpoint had been characterized at the sequence level in Drosophila 24 Unfortunately the limited number of events in our data makes it difficult to estimate the absolute rate of genome rearrangement at the sequence level in Drosophila More extensive analysis of genome rearrangement at the sequence level in Caenorhabditis by Coghlan and Wolfe 62 suggests that rates of genome rearrangement are fourfold higher in nematodes than in flies As micro inversions such as that seen in the D littoralis ftz region are not expected to be included in cytological estimates this claim will have to be re evaluated using large scale comparative sequence data in Drosophila There is mounting evidence for the role of transposable elements in the origin of inversion breakpoints in D melanogaster and other species 63 64 65 In contrast our data provide no evidence that rearrangement breakpoints fixed between Drosophila species are associated with transposable element sequences see also 24 Together these observations suggest a hit and run scenario in which transposable elements may play a part in the origin of chromosome rearrangements but are lost either through deletion or transposition by the time rearrangements reach high frequency or fixation between species 66 Consistent with this scenario is the fact that transposable element sequences are not conserved between species within unrearranged microsyntenic regions for example the HB element in the ap region Figure 4 The maintenance of microsyntenic regions we observe at the scale of multi gene fosmid sized regions approximately 40 kb should improve identification of orthologs for comparative gene modeling On the other hand de novo comparative gene identification can be complicated if for example nested genes maintain microsyntenic relationships 67 In addition as the few rearrangement breakpoints we observed occur exclusively in intergenic regions see also 24 rearrangement breakpoints may also help define the boundaries of complex genetic loci Conservation of microsynteny between genes and flanking intergenic regions may reveal structural and functional connections in the genome and thus it may be possible to associate functional non coding sequences with the appropriate flanking gene through genome rearrangements see also 30 Proof of this principle can be seen for the intergenic region 3 to eve and 5 to TER94 which maintains association with eve but not TER94 in non melanogaster group species Figure 2 This conservation of microsynteny between the eve coding and 3 CNCSs is consistent with the fact that this region is known to contain multiple enhancer sequences that regulate embryonic eve expression 50 51 Prospects for comparative cis regulatory prediction in Drosophila Conservation of non coding sequences is rapidly becoming one of the most powerful methods of predicting individual cis regulatory elements in genomic sequences 68 Most computational methods designed to identify CNCSs rely on the assumption that non coding conservation implies functional constraint rather than heterogeneity in mutation rates 45 Our results provide two pieces of evidence that support this assumption and argue against a simple mutational cold spot interpretation of non coding conservation First we demonstrate that the lengths of spacer intervals separating CNCSs are non randomly distributed in the Drosophila genome indicating a tendency for CNCSs to be clustered in non coding DNA Second we show that the spatial relationships of neighboring CNCSs are generally conserved as revealed by the strong correlation of spacer interval lengths in divergent species Clustering of CNCSs and conservation of CNCS spacing are not expected under a mutational cold spot hypothesis and suggest that the spacer intervals between CNCSs and therefore CNCSs themselves are under functional constraint Given the rapid rate of DNA loss for unconstrained sequences in Drosophila 48 49 it is difficult to understand the mere existence of spacer intervals as well as their conservation of length without invoking some form of functional constraint acting on these sequences Clustering of CNCSs has also been recently reported in the worm genome 47 and future research will determine if CNCS clustering is a general feature of non coding conservation in metazoan genomes As yet there has been no report of a general tendency for CNCSs to be clustered in mammalian genomes although certain regions of the mammalian genome such as the H19 region 69 show a strong pattern of CNCS clustering The general functional significance of CNCS clusters remains to be explored but it is clear that some CNCS clusters correspond to functional enhancer sequences We show here proof of the principle that CNCS clusters can be used to identify functional enhancer sequences in the Drosophila genome Figure 7 8 as Ishihara et al 69 have shown for CNCS clusters in the mammalian genome Using CNCS clusters to identify enhancers represents the comparative genomic analogue of efforts to predict cis regulatory sequences by exploiting the clustering of predicted transcription factor binding sites 70 71 However unlike binding site clusters CNCS clusters can be rapidly identified in the absence of any a priori information about transcription factor specificity and may therefore provide a more general approach to genome wide cis regulatory prediction In fact CNCS clusters may be a powerful source of data for inferring transcription factor specificity as specific binding site motifs are likely to be locally over represented in CNCS clusters with demonstrable enhancer function Using the intrinsic clustering of CNCSs provides a new way of circumventing the reliance on expression data implicit in current approaches to CNCS based motif discovery 72 Finally successfully linking CNCS clusters with enhancer function will provide an alternative means of defining enhancer structure based on evolutionary rather than operational criteria Conclusions The patterns of divergence in both coding and cis regulatory sequences described here indicate that D pseudoobscura will greatly aid efforts to functionally annotate the D melanogaster genome and justify the choice of D pseudoobscura as the second Drosophila species for complete genome sequencing The divergence between these species is sufficient such that there does not appear to be any need to go to more distantly related species to obtain a high level of signal to noise to detect functionally constrained sequences This observation suggests that the search for additional Drosophila species whose genome sequence would help interpret the D melanogaster sequence should focus on species at a similar evolutionary distance as D pseudoobscura Of the species studied here D erecta is too closely related to D melanogaster for comprehensive gene and cis regulatory prediction Neither coding nor non coding sequences have experienced sufficient divergence to differentiate whether sequences conserved between D erecta and D melanogaster result from functional constraint or shared ancestry Figures 2 4 At the other extreme using A gambiae genome sequences may not substantially aid comprehensive genome annotation as a large proportion of Drosophila genes may not be present in the Anopheles genome and the lack of non coding conservation between these groups Figure 7and 23 means that this powerful source of data is unavailable for cis regulatory annotation In contrast divergent species in the genus Drosophila such as D littoralis and D willistoni show similar properties to each other and to D pseudoobscura in terms of their utility for identifying functionally constrained coding or non coding sequences D willistoni and D melanogaster are both members of the subgenus Sophophora thus these two species are expected to share more aspects of their biology in common than either will with D littoralis Therefore we propose that of the species studied here D willistoni is the most suitable candidate for the third Drosophila species for complete genome sequencing We make this suggestion despite the increased rate of evolution and changes in base composition and codon usage observed in this lineage In fact it may be possible to take advantage of these unusual patterns of molecular evolution in the D willistoni lineage to dissect regions of the Drosophila genome under different levels of functional constraint Given a more thorough understanding of these phenomena and their cause s we believe that a D willistoni genome sequence would complement efforts to annotate the Drosophila genome based on whole genome comparisons between D melanogaster and D pseudoobscura Materials and methods Construction of Drosophilaspecies fosmid libraries Four Drosophila species spanning a range of divergence times in the genus were selected for study D erecta strain 14021 0224 0 D pseudoobscura strain 14011 0121 4 D willistoni strain 14030 0814 10 and D littoralis strain 15010 1001 10 All strains are available from the Tucson Drosophila species stock center 73 To construct fosmid libraries genomic DNA from adult flies was prepared by partial digestion with Mbo I and size selecting fragments using pulsed field gel electrophoresis then cloned in the Bam HI site of the fosmid vector pFOS1 74 and transformed into Escherichia coli strain XL1 Blue MR Stratagene Detailed information about the Drosophila stocks construction of the genomic fosmid libraries and their availability can be found at the Children s Hospital of Oakland Research Institute BACPAC Resources website 75 Probe design and library screening To amplify gene specific STSs D erecta D pseudoobscura D willistoni and D littoralis genomic DNA was isolated from adult flies and used as template for PCR with degenerate primers Primer sequences are available upon request Double stranded 40 nucleotide oligomers designed from the gene and species specific STSs were radioactively labeled with 32P and hybridized to genomic colony filters 76 Positive clones were subjected to PCR to remove false positives and restriction mapped using Sal I Not I Eco RI Not I double digestions The largest clone overlapping all positive hits was sheared and subcloned into 3 kb plasmids and sequenced using methods described in 9 From the results of this screen we estimated the average number of unique hits per library per species to be 4 1 for D erecta 3 2 for D pseudoobscura 2 2 for D willistoni and 2 9 for D littoralis These figures indicate that these libraries have fewer unique hits than the expected approximately 5 coverage Sequences for these clones have been submitted to GenBank under the accession numbers AY186999 and AY190934 AY190963 Comparative gene prediction Coding sequences in these fosmid clones were predicted using the computational pipeline used to re annotate the D melanogaster genome 12 The only major modification to this pipeline was to add an additional tier of evidence containing the results of TBLASTN searches of all Release 3 D melanogaster peptides 14 against non melanogaster sequences Gene predictions were manually verified and refined using the annotation platform Apollo 13 As no EST information exists to annotate transcribed non coding sequences such as UTRs for non melanogaster species we annotated only protein coding gene and exon models For similar reasons and to minimize the insertion deletion of amino acids at intron exon boundaries we did not require non melanogaster models to obey consensus splice site rules Annotated sequences were stored and queried in Gadcompara a cloned version of the D melanogaster annotation database Gadfly To identify orthologous genes in Anopheles gambiae 8 987 scaffolds from project accession number AAAB00000000 were downloaded from GenBank and searched using default parameters of TBLASTN 2 0 77 with the D melanogaster peptides listed in Supplementary Table 1 see additional data files as queries Homologs were identified as HSPs with an expected value 10 20and 30 identity over 100 amino acids Alignment and estimation of sequence conservation Orthologous regions of the D melanogaster genome corresponding to sequenced fosmids were identified using default parameters of BLAT 78 against a database made up of the Release 3 sequences 9 The union of sequences spanning hits to each candidate region was extracted and is listed in Table 1 Orthologous coding and peptide sequences from D melanogaster were identified by unique gene symbols in Gadfly using Release 3 annotations 14 For genes with alternative transcripts the transcript leading to the longest translation product was chosen in most but not all cases Coding and translated amino acid sequences from non melanogaster species were extracted from Gadcompara using MySQL queries Multiple alignment of orthologous amino acid sequences was carried out using the default parameters of DIALIGN 2 1 79 Amino acid alignments were used to align coding sequences using the gap_cds utility of the SEALS package 80 to ensure that nucleotide alignment gaps were inserted between codons Pairwise K a K s tests were carried out using PAML 3 12 22 with runmode 2 as outlined in 20 Evidence of functional constraint was inferred when twice the difference in likelihoods between a model with K a K s ratio fixed at 1 versus one with K a K s as a free parameter exceeded a cutoff such that the p value was less than 0 05 per number of tests Estimates of K a and K s in Table 2were obtained using the method of Yang and Nielson 81 which accounts for differences in nucleotide and codon frequencies as well as transition transversion rate bias implemented in PAML 3 12 22 Multiple amino acid and coding sequence alignments are available on request Annotations of candidate regions in Table 1were exported from Gadfly in VISTA format 43 and used to evaluate conservation in non coding sequences Nontranscribed intergenic and transcribed UTR and intron non coding sequences were analyzed together 44 Pairwise alignment of homologous genomic regions between D melanogaster and individual non melanogaster species was performed using default parameters of the AVID global alignment tool 42 CNCSs were identified in VISTA using a window size of 10 bp with an identity of 90 with manual post processing to remove spurious matches at the beginning and end of the alignments Repeat masking was performed before coding sequence annotation to identify transposable elements however it is possible that some CNCSs are simple repetitive sequences Only sequences from candidate regions that clearly maintain microsynteny in non melanogaster species were included in estimates of non coding conservation Thus the entire D littoralis ftz Rh3 and Rh4 clones as well as rearranged segments of the D willistoni D pseudoobscura and D littoralis eve clones D willistoni and D pseudoobscura Rh1 clones and D willistoni Rh3 clones were omitted from analyses of non coding conservation In addition we also reanalyzed non coding conservation between D melanogaster and D virilis using this same approach for the dataset of 44 Pairwise genomic alignments and VISTA regions files are available on request Generation of transgenic flies and expression analysis The CNCS cluster carrying the ap brain enhancer was amplified from D melanogaster BAC and D virilis P1 clones bearing the ap gene respectively The following pairs of oligonucleotides were used for PCR amplification

virilis 1 658 bp were cloned into pCaSpeRhs43 gal to generate pChabMelBR and pChabVirBR respectively These constructs were injected into D melanogaster y w embryos by standard P element transformation 82 Two independent lines were generated with pChabMelBR and three with pChabVirBR all of which showed similar expression patterns Transgenic embryos were immunostained with monoclonal anti gal
