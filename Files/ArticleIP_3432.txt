 The Darkling Thrush By Thomas Hardy posted Wednesday June 24 1998 To hear Robert Pinsky read The Darkling Thrush click As the turn of a millennial century approaches many works of art in various media will respond to that rotation of the calendar It will be hard for a poet to surpass the poise and penetration of Thomas Hardy s The Darkling Thrush which is dated as being composed on the last evening of the 19 th century The delightfully vivid bird with its blend of comedy and pathos may be Hardy s bow of his head toward such Romantic birds as the nightingale heard by John Keats in his great Ode to a Nightingale much earlier in the century Words and phrases like the repeated seems I could think and I was unaware enact Hardy s somewhat skeptical holding back from a declaration that the natural surroundings reflect his mood or the human calendar The way the first half of the poem ends with the word I also makes me feel a recognition that the fervorless or haunted or corpselike quality of the landscape like the bird s putative hope later is something that the subjective observer at least half creates Robert Pinsky I leant upon a coppice gate When Frost was spectre gray And Winter s dregs made desolate The weakening eye of day The tangled bine stems scored the sky Like strings of broken lyres And all mankind that haunted nighHad sought their household fires The land s sharp features seemed to be The Century s corpse outleant His crypt the cloudy canopy The wind his death lament The ancient pulse of germ and birth Was shrunken hard and dry And every spirit upon earth Seemed fervorless as I At once a voice arose among The bleak twigs overheadIn a full hearted evensong Of joy illimited An aged thrush frail gaunt and small In blast beruffled plume Had chosen thus to fling his soul Upon the growing gloom So little cause for carolings Of such ecstatic soundWas written on terrestrial things Afar or nigh around That I could think there trembled through His happy good night airSome blessed Hope whereof he knew And I was unaware Dec 31 1900
