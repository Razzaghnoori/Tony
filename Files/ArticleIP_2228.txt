 Goldilocks in Cyberspace Goldilocks in Cyberspace As breathlessly reported in the new Circuits section of the New York Times two twentysomething writers named Andrew Shapiro and David Shenk were commiserating over lunch in Greenwich Village one day last summer over their problem How sad that a summer day in Greenwich Village should have been clouded by a shared problem And what was their problem Had they both lost a parent recently Spent their last nickel Found out their girlfriends had been White House interns Been diagnosed with cancer No Their problem In writing and speaking they spend a lot of time in linguistic contortions trying to explain that they neither love nor hate technology What a problem This may well be the most boring problem anyone has ever had Or at least we would like to hear rival claims for that honor Still questions remain Why the linguistic contortions Exactly what is so difficult about explaining that you neither love nor hate technology Maybe the problem was getting anyone to listen Who gives a shit Go away For that matter why do Messrs Shapiro and Shenk themselves feel such a passionate need to share their lack of passion with others Why don t they just continue having lunch with each other engaging in delightfully desultory contortion free conversations and leave the rest of us out of it How do you like your new DVD player Oh it s OK I neither love it nor hate it And what do you think of the new Windows 98 beta My feelings are mixed There are good things and bad things about it And so on as lunch turns into drinks then dinner and dusk slowly darkens the summer sky Or here s a little tip If there s a subject on which you have no feelings one way or another try talking about something else You ll be amazed how well that can work But no Instead of these sensible solutions to their problem the gentlemen have taken the paradoxically agitated step of founding a group the Technorealists and issuing a manifesto about their lack of strong feelings The manifesto is on the Web natch at www technorealism org but we are so stupefied by this problem that we are unable to summon the will to click on the link Somebody tell us what it says Or on second thought don t Technorealism will be seen by history as a tragic movement Like Goldilocks without Baby Bear Technorealists roam the landscape tasting the porridge always finding it too hot or too cold and never just right Their linguistic contortions turn into bodily contortions as they literally tie themselves in knots their desperation for attention doing battle with their determination to say nothing worthy of it Ultimately they die not of boredom of that they re merely carriers Their last words are Honest I wish I could persuade you that I neither love nor hate technology I know you find that hard to accept but really it s true Technology to me has its good points and its bad points It s a mixed bag I know this is a terribly iconoclastic proposition and that s why I m not asking you to believe it I m only asking you to believe that I believe it Why are you coming at me with that pillow Urgggghhhh Technorealists Wanted Now here s a real problem Slate is
