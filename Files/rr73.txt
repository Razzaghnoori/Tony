 Introduction Three dimensional 3D collagen gel culture has been used as an in vitro model of in vivo tissue contraction a common feature of fibrosis as well as the resolution of granulation tissue that characterizes repair 1 2 Short term co cultures of monocytes with fibroblasts result in the inhibition of collagen gel contraction 3 while co cultures of fibroblasts with neutrophils or with neutrophil elastase NE augment contraction 4 Results in the linked study 5 demonstrated that 3D collagen gel contraction was augmented in extended co cultures of fibroblasts and monocytes Since MMPs play a prominent role in connective tissue degradation 6 7 8 the current study an extension of this linked study was designed to explore the potential role of MMPs in this process Materials and methods Cells and cultures See Supplementary material Preparation of collagen gels for three dimensional co culture Collagen gels were prepared as described previously 9 For long term co culture the medium was changed every 5 days The areas of floating gels were measured using an image analyzer To investigate the effect of PGE 2 on collagen degradation indomethacin 1 M or PGE 2 0 1 M was added to the medium Gelatinase activity assay Gelatin zymography was performed by modification of a previously published procedure to identify MMPs 1 and 9 10 11 Immunoblot analysis of metalloproteinases To further identify the MMPs produced immunoblots for MMPs 1 and 3 were performed Results Effect of co culture on gelatinase activity As shown in Figures 1and 2 fibroblasts alone routinely released primarily MMP 2 into their surrounding medium as identified at the molecular weights of 72 kDa latent form and 66 kDa active form Fig 1 Over 5 days elastase appeared to partially convert some of the latent 72 kDa form to the 66 kDa form With increasing incubation time MMP 2 present in culture medium gradually decreased Even at day 21 however there was readily detectable MMP 2 consistent with ongoing release Fig 1a Co culture of monocytes and fibroblasts increased both bands of MMP 2 and resulted in more of the 66 kDa form Fig 1b Co culture of fibroblasts with monocytes also induced the release of MMP 9 Fig 1b which was present as the latent 92 kDa form Addition of elastase nearly completely converted the latent 92 kDa MMP 9 to the active 83 kDa form With increasing culture time the amount of detectable MMP 9 in co cultures decreased In contrast to the co cultures monocytes cultured alone released no gelatinolytic activity data not shown Neutrophil elastase NE augmented and PGE 2 inhibited the conversion of 72 kDa MMP 2 to the 66 kDa form in fibroblasts cultured alone Fig 2a In co cultures indomethacin resulted in a marked increase of conversion of MMP 9 from the 92 kDa to the 83 kDa form most readily observed in the absence of NE where conversion was minimal Fig 2b The addition of exogenous PGE 2 decreased the conversion of MMP 9 to the 83 kDa form MMP 9 Neither indomethacin nor PGE 2 induced release of gelatinase activity in monocytes cultured alone data not shown Effect of co culture on MMP 1 No detectable MMP 1 was observed in cultures of monocytes Fig 3 In fibroblasts alone a trace of MMP 1 was occasionally detectable In co cultures of monocytes and fibroblasts however there was marked induction of MMP 1 which was present at a size corresponding to the latent 52 kDa form Fig 3 The detectable MMP 1 in co cultures was maximal at earlier times decreasing with increase cultured time and becoming undetectable by 15 days Fig 3 The presence of neutrophil elastase for the first 5 days converted latent MMP 1 to active 42 kDa and 20 kDa forms Indomethacin augmented the induction of MMP 1 in co culture Fig 4 In contrast PGE 2 reduced the amount of total MMP 1 and decreased the conversion of the 52 kDa form to the lower molecular weight forms in the presence of elastase Neither indomethacin nor PGE 2 had an effect on MMP 1 in cultures of monocytes or fibroblasts alone Effect of co culture on MMP 3 Neither fibroblasts nor monocytes alone released detectable MMP 3 Fig 5 In co cultures of monocytes and fibroblasts however MMP 3 release was readily detected in a size corresponding to the latent 57 kDa form Fig 5 MMP 3 release was greatest at the earliest time points evaluated and decreased with time becoming undetectable by 15 days of culture Addition of NE for the first 5 days resulted in conversion of the 57 kDa form to active 47 and 35 kDa forms Indomethacin augmented the induction of MMP 3 while PGE 2 reduced the conversion of MMP 3 to lower molecular weight forms Fig 6 Neither indomethacin nor PGE had an effect on MMP 3 on fibroblasts or monocytes cultured alone Discussion In pulmonary emphysema various inflammatory mediators have been suggested to cause tissue destruction and loss of structure 12 13 14 15 Several lines of evidence support the concept that neutrophil elastase contributes to the pathogenesis of emphysema 6 7 Evidence including the marked expansion of macrophage numbers in smokers lungs and in studies from genetically altered mice also supports a role for macrophage derived proteases in emphysema 16 17 These concepts are not exclusive and it is possible that several proteolytic and inflammatory mechanisms contribute to the development of emphysema In the linked study 5 extended co cultures of fibroblasts and monocytes augmented collagen gel contraction and degraded the extracellular matrix NE added to co cultures resulted in a concentration dependent degradation of collagen The current study suggests that this increased degradation of extracellular collagen may be due to NE activation of latent MMPs induced in the co culture conditions NE has been demonstrated to result in the augmentation of contraction 4 It also has been suggested to play an important role in the development of emphysema In animals instillation of NE can result in the development of pulmonary emphysema 18 Individuals deficient in 1 protease inhibitor moreover have an increased susceptibility to the development of emphysema 19 20 21 The current study suggests the possibility that NE can collaborate with MMPs leading to the degradation of extracellular matrix The MMPs are a family of proteolytic enzymes 22 23 Most are released as latent precursors Proteolytic cleavage of the latent forms can result in generation of active proteases 24 25 The MMPs differ both in their substrate specificity and in their mechanisms of activation Since some members of the MMP family are capable of activating other members 26 27 it is likely that proteolytic cascades may regulate MMP activity A further degree of regulation of MMP activity is afforded by the family of inhibitors tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases TIMPs 28 Recent studies in genetically altered mice have suggested an important role for multiple proteases in the development of emphysema Mice deficient in MMP 9 MMP 12 or NE are resistant to the development of emphysema or skin blisters 8 16 Mice overexpressing collagenase however develop emphysema 14 The current study proposes a possible collaboration among proteases that is responsible for the tissue degradation associated with the disease According to results from this study several proteases are induced in co cultures and activated in the presence of NE It is likely that other proteolytic enzymes may also play a role beyond those evaluated in the current study In this context fibroblasts are known to express cell surface proteases which may have a major role in regulating the activity of other mediators in the extracellular milieu 29 30 31 It is of interest that PGE 2 appears to be able to regulate the protease activity responsible for extracellular matrix degradation It is unlikely that PGE 2 functions directly as a protease inhibitor It seems more plausible that PGE 2 regulates proteolytic activity by altering the production of antiproteases or by altering the production of components essential in the proteolytic cascade leading to collagen degradation 31 The sequence of proteolytic events by which NE leads to collagen degradation is incompletely defined PGE 2 however could potentially modulate the proteolytic cascade resulting in collagen degradation at a number of steps Both PGE 2 and a cascade of proteolytic events that lead to extracellular matrix degradation have the potential for serving as paracrine regulators Such a means of regulation may be particularly important in tissue remodeling It seems unlikely that tissue remodeling is accomplished by individually active fibroblasts Rather coordinated activity within a tissue would seem to be a more appropriate means to accomplish alteration in tissue structure Paracrine regulation would seem to be ideally suited to accomplish such an effect Conclusion This study demonstrates that monocytes and fibroblasts in co culture can release MMPs and degrade extracellular matrix Activation of MMPs by NE can augment this process PGE 2 can modulate this proteolytic cascade These data support a role for collaborative interaction among inflammatory mediators
