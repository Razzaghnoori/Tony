 Thunderballs Early in Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me the stumpy snaggletoothed British secret agent Mike Myers survives an assassination attempt by his new bride Vanessa Elizabeth Hurley who turns out to have been a fembot programmed by his nemesis Dr Evil also Myers to blow up the couple s honeymoon suite after 15 rounds of zealous humping Following a suitable period of mourning for his exploded mate five seconds Austin greets his restored bachelorhood with a frenzy of exhibitionism romping nude through the lobby of his posh hotel pointing out his privates to assorted female passers by and launching into a lengthy water ballet in the company of Esther Williams style chorines Watching this sequence I thought of the late David Niven who during the 1974 Academy Awards ceremony saw a streaker charge across the stage and brought the house down with an ad lib about the fellow showing off his shortcomings Niven wouldn t get a laugh here Myers has rendered himself invulnerable to the incinerating one liners of prudes and sniggerers Austin might be oblivious to his own ridiculousness but Myers isn t He has made Austin s shortcomings the man s strongest suit and the act of showing them off both smashingly funny and yes attractive Forget about defeating Dr Evil Austin Powers represents the exuberant conquest of shame The Spy Who Shagged Me is better than anyone dared hope bigger more inventive and more frolicsome than its predecessor with a grab bag of scatological gags that are almost as riotous when you think back on them I m laughing now The movie gives infantilism a good name Let me add that I wasn t a fan of the first installment Austin Powers International Man of Mystery 1997 which tanked after a lively opening It was rife with overextended jokes and the strange thing was that the joke wasn t the joke the joke was the overextension of the joke The terrible flaccid timing was what was supposed to be funny I wondered What does it say when a gifted performer such as Myers sets out to make a bad movie the kind of cheeseball 60s Bond imitation that untalented people made by accident But I underestimated Myers connection to the material As a youth he evidently fantasized about living in London s swinging 60s portrayed in movies as an era when ugly posturing little guys could routinely make it with long haired short skirted hippie chicks who d dance ecstatically while the camera zooms in and out TV shows like Laugh In and movies like Casino Royale 1967 and In Like Flint 1967 must have got all mashed together in his wet dreams His resulting alter ego Austin Powers is Man before the Fall provided you see the Fall as the mid 70s when embarrassment returned to the culture with a vengeance It helps that in The Spy Who Shagged Me Dr Evil has soared in stature becoming nearly as heroic a throwback as Austin himself the supervillain seeming far more vulnerable to the slings and arrows of ridicule than the superhero The bald curdle faced pinky sucker is still locked in excruciating combat with his teen aged son Scott Evil Seth Green who never misses a chance to jeer at his father s grandiosity and who in turn is dismissed as quasievil semievil A partially successful cloning attempt by Dr Evil s henchman Number 2 Robert Wagner has produced a true heir a one eighth Dr Evil replica Verne J Troyer dubbed Mini Me who s like a distillation of the archvillain s most feral impulses This snarling munchkin gives the Dr Evil scenes which still run long a blast of energy Dr Evil s subtext of sexual jealousy has become his motive Covetous of Austin Powers lack of inhibition he contrives to go back in time to 1969 when both he and Powers were cryogenically frozen and steal the source of the secret agent s appeal his life force or mojo Mojo less Austin panics when the opportunity comes to shag CIA agent Felicity Shagwell Heather Graham mojo laden Dr Evil leaps into bed with his heretofore lesbian henchwoman Frau Farbissina Mindy Sterling but post coitus cannot maintain a guiltless hedonism It got weird didn t it he murmurs The director Jay Roach keeps the picture bumping along refusing to give the gags more weight than they warrant Actually he rarely gives them any weight The bad jokes don t fall flat so much as blow away like onion skins The commercial tie ins for Starbucks Virgin Atlantic Airlines and Heineken aren t as oppressive as one might fear although Austin s AOL e mail address is a cybernetic badge of uncool You go to a movie like this for the cameos and in jokes for Tim Robbins popping up as a harried U S president or Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello emerging to croon beautifully What Do You Get When You Fall in Love In the credits Rob Lowe s name is superimposed over Myers bare butt Willie Nelson and Woody Harrelson appear largely because their first names are euphemisms for penis Now there s a riff on You Only Live Twice 1967 now a hyperbolic parody of Thunderball 1965 now a piece of lame slapstick involving an electrical swivel chair Dr Evil dispatches a new henchman a 400 plus pound kilt wearing Scotsman named Fat Bastard also Myers to poke a long needle into the frozen Austin s crotch Later Austin mistakenly pours himself a cup of coffee from a jar containing a Fat Bastard stool sample There are also more sophisticated interlocking parodies as when grim faced NORAD radar operators tune in Jerry Springer and find Seth and Dr Evil in the middle of a show called My Father Is Evil and Wants To Take Over the World a segment that degenerates into bleeping and fisticuffs when the archvillain rushes an indignant Klansman No doubt Heather Graham is one of prettiest women on Earth Her face has the freshness of a junior high school yearbook photo it might be the apotheosis of the junior high school yearbook photo and there s more than a touch of Barbie in her long thighs and high bottom She knows how to move and she s sweet and she s game But let s face it she s a twittering blank a bore I miss the witty poise that Elizabeth Hurley brought to the first Austin Powers More than that I wish that Myers had it in him to cultivate his counterpart as a comic actress and then let her rip an actress who could be nerdy and alluring at once who d have a comeback for I put the grrrrr in swinger baby I nominate Lisa Kudrow but there are probably others You just have to be brave enough to look For all Myers fearlessness he has yet to prove his manhood by letting an equal into his bed L imbo the latest effort from John Sayles strains to be a great movie to the point where it breaks into two different movies neither fully successful but both with huge compensations The first is a grimly sardonic portrait of Alaska as a kind of Third World melting pot full of desperate poverty and crime and on the verge of a transition to a tourist based economy in which the interior will be cleared of timber but an illusion of wildness maintained Alaska we re promised will turn into a giant neo Disney theme park The other story is the love affair between a luckless torch singer Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and a luckless ex fisherman David Strathairn in which the two through a series of melodramatic contrivances that testify to Sayles lack of ingenuity as a storyteller end up together with the singer s brilliant desperately unhappy daughter Vanessa Martinez on a remote island where they re prey to cold starvation and drug smugglers with shotguns Plotting was never Sayles forte What he did have from the start was an actor s insight into how people dramatize themselves and a novelist s insight into how they actually appear He can write sharp funny spiels and interlocking monologues in which people misrepresent themselves but somehow miraculously communicate their essence At some point though he decided to become a saint of leftist independent filmmaking to turn away from his real gifts suppress his craftiness and make movies about ordinary people crushed by an economic system that sets brother against brother or sister He cultivated a wanness in himself he labored to locate the Canadian within At its worst Limbo is about when bad things happen to good people and its ending is cruelly abrupt although maybe merciful if it means what I think it does But its best is really good I m not sure I totally buy Strathairn as a diffident loner with an aching conscience over a tragedy that wasn t his fault the quintessential guiltless sinner But Sayles has written some gorgeously tender and funny encounters between him and Mastrantonio And she is simply extraordinary Always a superb actress who never quite had the stature for a leap to stardom Mastrantonio like Diane Lane in A Walk on the Moon has developed layers and an edge Her Donna De Angelo I hate that tart angel name is both desperate to grab onto a man and smart enough to watch in horror as she s grabbing She has a torch singer s simultaneous immersion and distance a talent for watching herself fall and for commenting on it exquisitely This is a major performance one of the comebacks of the decade
