 Headline Katha Ah yes space the final tedium Do you remember the Simpsons episode when Homer was desperate to switch channels because there was a shuttle launch being broadcast I m with Homer I ve never gotten the space thing I remember watching the shuttle blowing up live I absentmindedly had the TV on in a friend s apartment where I was staying at the time and feeling it was sad and a shame but essentially carrying on as normal Then I switched on the news and everyone was having a national identity crisis Still can t figure it out I tried watching the Tom Hanks HBO miniseries on the moon landings but it was like watching Cuban television on the feats of the agrarian revolution A horrible mixture of boredom and uplift But we better get used to it Two words for you President Gore Talking of dead people can you bring yourself to say something nice about Linda McCartney It seems to me that Paul my favorite Beatle really is an admirable fellow and his marriage was of a kind that all the family mongers really should celebrate True love in all its banalizing talent wrecking middle brow glory Poor Linda got a terrible p r deal Could Bob Barr or Trent Lott speak up please in her behalf She made Tammy Wynette seem countercultural Or are we reduced once again to the charming Mr Kasich to speak the truth to his generation best Andrew
