                            For the estimated  million people living largely in developing countries without        enough food to eat the main food risk is starvation But if you ask When does food        actually kill in a country such as the United Kingdom Not that often is the short        reply you would give after reading Hugh Penningtons book         When Food Kills BSE E coli         and Disaster Science  The two foodborne diseases that occupy much of        the book         Escherichia coli  and bovine spongiform encephalopathy        BSE kill humans very rarely although the ramifications and implications of these few        deaths for science regulators and government are large        As Pennington clearly explains there is still much uncertainty in the science of BSE        and the eventual UK death toll from the human form may be as low as a few hundred with        even the most pessimistic expert assessments putting the upper bound as fewer than         Foodborne         E coli  kills fewer than a dozen people a year in the        UK        Whilst each death is a terrible tragedy and an indescribably harrowing experience for        those close to the victim these figures are small when compared with other ways in which        food kills Epidemiologists estimate that the dietary contributions to cardiovascular        disease and cancer between them kill more than  people a year in Britain Yet we        hear much more about BSE and         E coli as food risks For instance a recent study by the        Kings Fund httpwwwkingsfundorgukpdfhealthinthenewssummarypdf reports that the        rate of news coverage in the UK of a death from variant CreutzfeldtJakob disease the        human form of BSE is nearly  times that for a death from obesity        In his characteristically diverting and obscurely erudite way Pennington describes this        discrepancy between public perception and magnitude of risk by referring to an article on        railway accidents published in  by one Dionysius Lardner The systematic and much more        revealing analyses of risk perception by psychologists such as Paul Slovic over the past         years do not get a mention        In fact one of the hallmarks of Penningtons style is his enthusiasm for taking his        reader down littleknown historical byways Whether it be the drowning possibly suicide        of King Ludwig II of Bavaria in the Starnberger See or the treatment of James Norris in        Bethlehem Lunatic Asylum in  Pennington has an almost endless supply of anecdotes to        provide peripheral colour to his main narrative Indeed on some occasions his delight in        the detail makes it hard to see where the main narrative is leading although his aim is to        show that similar conclusions can be drawn about risk management in food transport oil        rigs and other fields        Anyone who has heard Hugh Pennington speak will know that he has a remarkably direct and        engaging style which he translates into the written word with verve Already on page  he        gets us into the mood by referring to a sample from a fiveyearold girl sent for analysis        at the start of the Lanarkshire         E coli outbreak of  It was a stool The word carries the        impression of firmness even of deliberate effort in its production Hers was not His        laconic sense of humour is also reflected in many of the wittily irrelevant or tangential        photographs My personal favourites are Her Majesty in Gloves on page  and Turds on        Campsite Track on page         The Lanarkshire         E coli  outbreak which in late  affected  people        and killed eight was very much Penningtons show He chaired the public enquiry that led        eventually to a change in the law requiring all butchers in the UK handling cooked and raw        meat to be licensed The license itself is less important than the training in food safety        management principles that precedes it The butcher John Barr and his staff whose shop        was the primary source of the outbreak apparently did not know that you have to keep raw        meat and readytoeat products separate to avoid crosscontamination with dangerous        pathogens such as         E coli  that can occur in raw meat Penningtons        authoritative and blowbyblow account shows failings not only in the butcher who was        incidentally Scottish Master Butcher of the Year in  but also in the inspectors who        had visited his shop eight times in the previous two years They had not apparently        picked up that Barr and his staff employed the same knives for cutting up raw and cooked        meat nor that they used a biodegradable cleaning fluid not realising that this is not        the same as biocidal        The second theme BSE is given somewhat shorter treatment Nevertheless Pennington        goes into some detail in assessing the prion theory of transmissible spongiform        encephalopathies he argues that a nucleic acid is not also involved He also reviews the        sequence of events that led the UK government in the early s to conclude that there was        not likely to be a risk to human health and to be slow to change its view This and the        concluding part of the book see below draw heavily on the Phillips Enquiry into BSE        Although this enquiry focussed on the response of the UK government its lessons are        relevant to other countries where BSE has emerged in recent years including many European        countries Japan Canada and the United States        In his book         Mountains of the Mind  Robert Macfarlane writes For the hunter risk        wasnt optionalit came with the job I sought risk out however I courted in fact paid        for it This is the great shift which has taken place in the history of risk It became        a commodity Pennington reflects a similar shift in attitude to food risk over the past        half century or so Back in  although it was known that over  people a year in        Britain died from drinking raw milk the risk was not seen as large enough to warrant        legislation to make pasteurisation compulsory We are now used to much higher standards of        food safety and we can as a society enjoy the luxury of fear of relatively minor        risks        Nevertheless there are important lessons from past failures for all involved in food        safety and in other areas of risk management and Pennington discusses some of these in        his concluding chapters He emphasises the need to continually review the evidence        underpinning risk assessments to communicate effectively with the media to ensure that        actions to manage risks are effectively implemented and audited Notably he refers to the        importance of inclusiveness and openness about risk and uncertainty in decisionmaking        If this becomes the norm it will be possible to say that good has come out of        tragedy
