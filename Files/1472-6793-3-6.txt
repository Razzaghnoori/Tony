 Background Loss of myocytes is thought to contribute to the progressivedecline in left ventricular function and the development of congestiveheart failure Recent studies have proposed that myocyte loss incardiomyopathy can occur by apoptosis without an inflammatory response reviewedin 1 2 3 In heart failure growth stimulation initially occurs as a compensatory effort tomeet chronically altered hemodynamic demands and is mediated by systemicand or local up regulation of mediators of adrenergic pathways andby various cytokines 4 5 However cytokinescan be directly toxic to cardiac myocytes and result in increasedapoptotic cell death 3 6 Local up regulationof angiotensin II induces immediate early genes which may leadto increased protein synthesis and myocardial hypertrophy or alternatively may up regulate expression of apoptotic proteins such as p53 incardiac myocytes The initial increase in circulating norepinephrineis thought to maintain cardiac function through inotropic mechanisms However a direct cardiac myocyte toxicity from norepinephrine iswell recognized 6 7 Furthermore pressure overloadand stretch associated release of angiotensin II has been shownto induce myocyte apoptosis 8 9 10 In an elegant paper by Telger et al it has clearly been demonstratedthat cardiac hypertrophy is initially preceded by a wave of apoptosisof cardiac myocytes followed by cell growth and a decrease in programmedcell death 10 Apoptosis may therefore be the consequence of prolonged growth stimulation adrenergicand renin angiotensin axes of adult cardiac myocytes which areterminally differentiated Similarly certain cytokines such astumor necrosis factor can induce growth as well as apoptosis 11 As proposed by Telger et al it isbecoming clear that cell growth and programmed cell death are infact two linked processes 10 Over the last five years blocker therapy has become one ofthe main treatment modalities for heart failure Of particular interestis the use of carvedilol 12 13 14 15 16 Carvedilol is a novel multiple action neurohormonal antagonist Its primary activities are nonselective adrenoceptor blockade vasodilatation mediated through 1 adrenoceptor blockade andantioxidant activity 12 In many clinical studies carvedilol has been shown to improve left ventricular function andsymptoms in patients with ischemic heart disease or idiopathic dilatedcardiomyopathy 13 14 15 16 andto dramatically reduce mortality 17 However it remains unclear how carvedilol improves ventricular functionin heart failure In an animal model of cardiomyopathy that has many similaritiesto human heart failure we tested the hypothesis that a reductionin apoptosis may be responsible for the beneficial effects of carvedilol As such attenuation of apoptosis in the myocardium may representa novel and important mechanism that contributes beneficial effects onthe myocardium Results Baseline Characteristics of Dilated Cardiomyopathic Animals We have previously shown that removal of furazolidone from thefeed after three weeks results in progressive cardiac dilatationand heart failure 18 At the time ofrandomization of the DCM group into three groups i e DCM 0 notreatment DCM 1 lower dose carvedilol or DCM 20 higherdose carvedilol fractional shortening was not different betweenthe groups p 0 1 Evidence for severe heart failure was markedby significantly reduced left ventricle fractional shortening controls63 67 1 04 n 34 vs DCM 11 95 0 59 n 18 p 0 001 Effect of Carvedilol on Ventricular Function We investigated the effect of carvedilol by administering twodifferent dosages 1 mg and 20 mg kg body weight per day to controland DCM turkeys for four weeks We studied two dosages pharmacologicaland non pharmacological as a difference in dose dependency forcardiac function improvement has previously been demonstrated byus with another non selective beta blocker 18 Furthermore we wanted to determine if carvedilol might exert beneficialeffects independent of heart rate effects The lower dose 1 mg kg did not reduce heart rate However the higher dose reduced HR byapproximately 15 for 8 hours In vivo contractile performance of the heart was assessed bythe determination of fractional shortening of the left ventricle As shown in Table 1and Figure 1 fractional shortening was increasedby 32 and 45 in DCM 1 and DCM 20 animals respectively compared to non treated DCM animals DCM 0 Comparedwith baseline values at the time of randomization the improvementin fractional shortening was of 57 in DCM 1 and 65 inDCM 20 Associated with improved cardiac function wasa reduction in the incidence of apoptotic nuclei see below The body weight was significantly decreased in DCM animals comparedto control animals p 0 001 compared to control Table 2 This animal model is associated withcachexia Carvedilol treatment resulted in a slight gain of bodyweight 15 in the DCM 1 group and 20 in the DCM 20 groupcompared with the non treated DCM group DCM 0 Carvediloalso increased the body weight of control animals p 0 001 These data indicate a favorable effect on cachexia In non treatedDCM animals the hearts weighed significantly less than control hearts p 0 01 DCM animals treated with carvedilol showed a significantincrease in HW compared to hearts from non treated DCM animals p 0 001 Therefore the HW BW ratio was lower for hearts fromcarvedilol treated DCM animals compared to hearts from non treatedDCM animals Interestingly the HW BW ratio was lower for carvediloltreated control animals compared to non treated control animals Left ventricle volume was significantly larger for non treated DCMhearts Carvedilol significantly decreased LV volume at both dosages Effect of Carvedilol on Cardiac Myocyte Apoptosis Evaluation of tissue sections by the TUNEL technique revealedonly small numbers of TUNEL positive cells in the control hearts Table 1and Figure 2A Hearts from DCManimals had a significant increase in the number of TUNEL positivecells compared to controls 5 64 0 49 vs 1 72 0 12 DCM andcontrol respectively p 0 001 indicating the occurrence ofapoptosis Figure 2B In contrast to non treated DCM hearts myocardial tissue sectionsprepared from hearts from animals treated with carvedilol showeda significant reduction in the numbers of TUNEL positive myocytenuclei An example of such an observation is depicted in Figure 3Aand 3B DCM 1 and DCM 20 respectively Both the lower and the higher doses of carvedilol were effectivein reducing apoptosis from 5 64 0 49 in non treated DCM animalsto almost control levels 2

characterizedexperimental model of dilated cardiomyopathy with features verysimilar to those found in human heart failure 19 20 21 22 Decreased contractile function reduced fractional shortening ofthe left ventricle and morphological changes increased heart volumes left ventricular dilatation and myocyte hypertrophy are characteristic featuresof this model 21 22 blocker treatment has emerged as an effective treatment modalityfor heart failure Both in animal and human studies of heart failure adrenergicblockade intervention appears to have beneficial effects on cardiacmyocyte function 1 23 24 Of particularimportance studies using carvedilol have shown remarkable improvementsin cardiac performance 12 13 15 16 andreduction in mortality in humans 17 We have previously shown that propranolol a nonselective blocker is cardioprotective and prevents the development of heart failurein turkeys when given concurrently with furazolidone 21 Similarly carteolol a nonselective blocker resulted in improvement in ejection fraction reduction in ventricularvolumes an increase in developed pressure as well as an increasein rate of survival in our turkey model 18 Improvementin cardiac function was associated with cellular remodeling of cardiacmyocytes Cardiac myocytes from hearts treated with a non selective blockeri e carteolol had normal calcium cycling normal myocardial energetics normal 1 receptor density as well as regression of myocytehypertrophy and reduced connective tissue content 18 Furthermore administration of carteolol hasbeen reported to prevent the development of virally induced cardiomyopathyin a murine model 25 In a canine modelwith left ventricular dysfunction produced by multiple sequentialintracoronary microembolizations long term treatment with metoprolol a 1 selective blocker has been reported to preventthe progression of LV systolic dysfunction and LV chamber dilatation 26 Similarly our present findings onthe effect of carvedilol indicated improvement of left ventricularfunction and smaller LV volumes Carvedilol prevented progressionof LV systolic dysfunction and LV dilatation as previously reportedin other models using blockers 18 26 Animals with dilated cardiomyopathy which received carvedilolshowed significant improvement in LV systolic function after 4 weeks Notably the improvement of LV systolic function in animals treatedwith carvedilol was associated with a decrease of LV volumes comparedwith non treated DCM animals Importantly both doses of carvedilolimproved LV contractile performance Fractional shortening wasincreased by an average of approximately 38 and impressively by80 in some individual animals These data seem to agree with the resultsof human clinical studies and are suggestive that carvedilol notonly slows deterioration of cardiac function but also improvescardiac function The trend that the 20 mg kg body weight dose might not have beenwell tolerated was demonstrated by some animals becoming moribundfor a short period after dosing which might be due to a reductionin heart rate and cardiac output with resultant reflect tachycardia We have previously shown a negative force interval relationship i e negative treppe in failing hearts with this model 18 This is in line with data from humanstudies which showed that when first administered blockers actually slowheart rate and diminish ejection fraction 27 The higher dose of carvedilol significantly reduced heart rate andblood pressure for up to eight hours Animals that tolerated thehigher dose did nevertheless benefit from the treatment This issimilar to human clinical studies where greater benefit is derivedfrom higher dosages if tolerated 28 Apoptosis in Animal Models of Heart Failure Heart failure is characterized by progressive deterioration ofglobal left ventricular function over time The mechanisms responsiblefor the worsening of cardiac function are not clear Loss of cardiacmyocytes has been suspected to be a feature of the cardiomyopathicprocess that contributes to progressive decline in left ventricularfunction and the development of congestive heart failure 29 Evidence supporting the concept ofmyocyte apoptosis occurrence and contribution in the progressionof heart failure has been obtained from a variety of observations including in vitro studies experimental animal modelsof cardiac dysfunction and studies on cardiac tissue obtainedfrom patients with end stage heart failure 5 7 8 9 29 We sought to evaluate the incidence and the extent of apoptosisin our animal model of heart failure Using the TUNEL techniqueas a means of detection we were able to document the occurrenceof apoptosis in ventricles from failing hearts which was characterizedby a higher percentage of apoptotic nuclei when compared to controls 5 64 vs 1 72 These apoptotic indexes are within the range of valuesin heart failure reported in the literature 0 2 to 35 3 30 31 32 33 The high degreeof variability reported in the literature in the magnitude of apoptosis maybe due to the diversity and specificity of methods used to quantifyapoptotic nuclei When reporting apoptotic nuclei using the TUNEL assay two observationsshould be considered 1 although apoptosis occurred in our modelof heart failure we might have missed in random histologicalsections evidence of apoptosis thereby under estimating the severityof programmed cell death due to the fact that apoptotic cells undergorapid phagocytosis with the entire process lasting less than twohours in some cell systems 34 and 2 apoptosisin the present study was evaluated at a single time point when theheart was still undergoing LV remodeling Hence the documentationof apoptosis at this stage may not reflect the true magnitude ofits occurrence during the initiation and transition to heart failure In a rat model of pressure overload hypertrophy produced by aorticbanding apoptosis appeared to peak at four days and gradually subsidedafter one month of aortic banding 9 Therefore a longitudinal study of apoptosis in failing hearts frominitiation to transition to failure is worth pursuing In this way the incidence of apoptosis can be documented as the heart movesprogressively from normal to compensated hypertrophy and finallyto overt decompensated heart failure These animals were in compensated heartfailure and often in the non treated group went into decompensatedheart failure when stressed during echocardiographic examination With improved cardiac function there should be a reduction inactivation of the adrenergic renin angiotensin axes as well as adecrease in activated cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor In our model of heart failure cardiac function correlated withthe incidence of apoptosis As described in Table 1and Figure 3 there were a higher number of apoptotic cells in hearts with a reductionin fractional shortening In contrast control hearts with normalventricular function showed low rates of apoptosis The extent andoccurrence of apoptosis may partially explain the lack of an overallincrease in heart weight in hearts from non treated DCM animals despite a pronounced increase in heart size These observations and the results from several animal models demonstrate that apoptoticcells are present in failing hearts suggesting that apoptosis mightbe a mechanism involved at least in part in the progression ofheart failure and the reduction of myocyte mass Carvedilol Inhibition of Apoptosis and Improvement of VentricularFunction The extent of apoptosis in cardiomyopathic animals was significantlyreduced by treatment with carvedilol Both the lower and higherdoses of carvedilol were effective in decreasing the rate of apoptosis approximately a 58 reduction This observation represents animportant finding in demonstrating the effectiveness of a cardiovasculardrug to protect against continual cardiac myocyte apoptosis in failinghearts in vivo Furthermore the inhibition of apoptosisby carvedilol was accompanied by signs of improvement in left ventricularfunction and heart size i e reduced LV volume in the myopathicanimals Whether the improved function small heart size and decreasedwall stress were responsible for a reduction in apoptosis is notknown However the derived cardiac benefit was independent of heartrate effects because benefit was obtained at both dosages Our data support the conclusions of Rossig et al in endothelialcells They reported levels of apoptotic cells for control andNYHA III IV hearts that were similar to our observations 35 We similarly believe that the suppressionof apoptosis by carvedilol is likely due to its antioxidative propertiesrather than the blocking effects 35 Webase this on our observation that a similar reduction in the incidenceof apoptosis was seen at both a non pharmacological no effect onheart rate or blood pressure as well as a pharmacological doseof carvedilol In a canine model of chronic heart failure producedby multiple sequential intracoronary embolizations metprolol a 1 selectiveblocker reduced the incidence of apoptosis supporting our experimentalobservations with carvedilol 36 The incidence of apoptosis was 5 32 0 77 in heart failure animalsthat were not treated which is similar to our findings of 5 64 0 49 in hearts from untreated animals with heart failure Recently Li et al have demonstrated that spontaneously hypertensive rats SHR with symptoms of heart failure had significantly higher levels ofapoptotic myocytes than control myocytes 37 When treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor thenumber of apoptotic cells in the SHR with symptoms of heart failurewas dramatically reduced to control levels controls were SHR withoutsymptoms of heart failure 37 Kajstura et al have also reported that angiotensin II increased the percentageof apoptotic cells in isolated adult rat ventricular myocytes andthis effect was mediated by AT 1 receptors 38 Although ventricular function was not assessed in these studies the observations raise the possibility that like our findings withcarvedilol the beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors or AT 1 receptorblockers in heart failure may in part be attributed to an inhibitionof myocyte apoptosis with a resultant improvement in in vivo cardiacfunction a concept that needs further study The data presented suggest that attenuation of apoptosis mayunderlie the beneficial effect of blockade on ventricular function and that the inhibition of apoptosis can possibly lead to improvementin ventricular function This represents a novel mechanism to slowthe progressive deterioration of myocardial function that can occurin patients with cardiac failure Because reactive oxygen radicalsplay a role in inducing cell apoptosis 39 andthe potent antioxidant property of carvedilol 12 we speculate that the beneficial effectsattributed to carvedilol i e inhibition of apoptosis and improvementof LV function are mediated in part by its prevention of oxygen derived freeradical damage 35 40 Our data supportsthis idea Therapeutic Significance With the clear demonstration that cardiac myocyte apoptosis ispresent in our heart failure model strategies for prevention ofapoptosis can be tested The clinical consensus has been that higherdoses of blockade should incur more benefits on ventricular remodeling However our studies demonstrated similar benefits at a therapeuticand sub therapeutic dose In light of the beneficial effect of carvedilolon the progression of heart failure and its unique multi actionsthat are not shared by any other blocking drug or by any otheragent currently used in the treatment of heart failure our findingsrepresent an important new mechanism of improved cardiac function The development of animal models of heart failure in which apoptosisis an important feature will allow the modulation of cell deathpathways through targeted interventions Understanding the roleof specific signaling pathways in cardiac myocyte apoptosis anddeveloping strategies to manipulate these intracellular pathwaysmay provide in the near future novel therapeutic approaches forthe management of heart failure Conclusions In conclusion our model of heart failure which shows a highlevel of congruence with the human condition has been shown tohave a high level of apoptosis that corresponds with cardiac failure Carvedilol a non selective blocker with blocking propertiesas well as antioxidant properties significantly reduced the incidenceof programmed cell death while improving cardiac function Thiseffect was independent of heart rate lowering effects i e blockade The beneficial effects of carvedilol can therefore be obtained withsubtherapeutic doses This is a novel observation and importantin treating patients who may not tolerate higher doses heart rateand blood pressure lowering of carvedilol The apoptotic processis linked to the development and progression of heart failure aswell as the improvement in cardiac function seen with blockade Methods Experimental Design One day old broad breasted white turkey poults obtained froma commercial breeder were wing banded for easy identification At seven days of age they were weighed and randomly divided intotwo groups using a random number generator The control group n 34 was maintained on a normal ration free from any additives and the experimental group n 91 was fed 700 parts per millionfurazolidone Fz for three weeks Furazolidone was stopped afterday twenty eight and the animals were randomized into three groups one group did not receive carvedilol treatment DCM 0 n 52 whereas the other two groups DCM 1 n 19 andDCM 20 n 20 were treated with carvedilol in the samedosages as respective aged matched control animals see following Similarly age matched control animals were randomized into threegroups one group received no pharmacological agent Con 0 n 13 whereas the other two groups received different dosagesof carvedilol 1 mg kg Con 1 n 11 or 20 mg kg bodyweight Con 20 n 10 The lower dose of carvedilol didnot lower heart rate or blood pressure However the higher doseof carvedilol resulted in a significant reduction in heart rate 15 and blood pressure 9 for up to eight hours We performeddose range studies using nine concentrations of carvedilol datanot shown At the time of euthanasia body
