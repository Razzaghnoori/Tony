 Don t be nervous OK What s your name Shannon Averitt And how old are you 19 And where are you from Charlotte NC Where in Charlotte West side of Charlotte OK And how was growing up in Charlotte Did you like it or Yeah I liked it a lot When um I was little I lived more near Lake Norman side of Charlotte If you re not from Charlotte you re not going to know where that s at but um it was really far away from everybody and behind the airport and stuff like that And um my junior year of high sch high school we moved into like the city the west side of Charlotte and I went to West Meck and that was a um culture experience I guess How how come Because it was more diverse Like in most schools in Charlotte if you go on other sides it s like everybody s just white but in my school there was every kind of person you could ever meet So I haven t met one person at UNC Charlotte that I didn t meet in my high school I can compare them to like black white Asian whatever grunge redneck it doesn t matter Do you think that s a good thing that it helped culture you or Yeah it did because I know people from Charlotte now that went to like not to slam Providence because I like a lot of those people but they like have like so many like stereotypes of people because they don t know anybody But then like I know people like that and they re people just like anybody else is OK And so is there anything in particular about growing up that you want to share that maybe changed you as a person Or made you the person that you are Anything in particular Hmm Tough question Yeah OK My dad um cause I wasn t really like I was a girl I mean I was a girl I mean like my junior year of high school the first dress I ever owned was my junior year prom dress Like because my dad always treated me like a boy because I was like I was the first girl on my dad s side of the family in like four generations or something like that Like my great grandfather s brothers and da da da da and then my dad had one brother and my two older cousins were both guys And then there was never like any female blood Averetts until like my oldest cousin had kids But like so I was always raised like a tomboy and everything like that and my dad treated me like a guy all the time And that s like I can totally see my dad in my personality Like when I lived at home we did not get along at all for anything in the world we would fight all the time I moved out and we get along perfect Cause we re like now I can say this because I m older or whatever and I can like deal with it I m exactly like my dad But when I was younger I would have shot myself before I would have admitted that me and my dad were the exact same So you guys get along really well now Yeah Unless I m like when I go home for like Christmas break after being there for like two weeks it was like I d never moved out and we get kind of like tense with each other Basically because we both um always think we re right I know about that Now what about your mom Were you close with her when you were growing up I was closer with my dad when I was little just because I did all the sports and everything like that and I ve always been close to my mom it was never like I didn t like my mom but um me my mom and I never really fight or anything like that but now me and my mom are a lot closer When I started doing like the whole shopping thing the make up thing everything like that me and my mom got really really close And then like now that I m in college like I call her like all the time and it won t occur that I should talk to my dad too But then like me and my mom will talk all the time and she ll come over here and she ll like have a beer and a cigarette with me and it doesn t matter anymore Just because you know she knows how I am I guess Do you think that s hard for your dad maybe that you re closer with your mom now than you are your dad Or do you think he kind of understands that s just the way Um it was hard for him at first I think because um like all of a sudden I was like so into softball so into sports and everything like that and I m still like I m still like that But it wasn t like Daddy s Little Wannabe Tomboy thing anymore you know Like I started doing more things with my mom I started doing this and I started doing that I think that was kind of hard for him you know Do you think he resents that now or I don t think he resents it I think he kind of had to suck it up and get it over with get over it Because like he saw that like I think he saw that I was like him before I would admit that I was like him Because he knew that I was going to do what I wanted to do without disrespecting my parents or do anything like that because I was still like not going to run out in a rampage and kind and be like a horrible person but it was just like my life now and And what s your major Theater Theater How do they feel about your being a Theater major Uh funny Actually my first semester at Charlotte I was a Pre Business major to go into Marketing and Advertising because I did that in high school too But I never wanted to do that I did that because that s what my dad wanted me to do And cause I was really involved in theater and stuff in high school and everything like that And kind of like coming in to college or whatever he kind of convinced me that what else am I going to do Uh huh If I he s like You re not going to do anything da da da He wasn t real supportive about it at all But um after my first semester was over with and I had like a real Theater class I knew that s what I still wanted to do Really And so I changed my major without telling my parents Oh gosh Then they got the whole schedule thing for the next year with the tuition bill on it and everything like that and my mom was reading it and it said Major THEA and she was like What is this She knew I was going to do it but Dad was pretty irate Then I started paying him half the tuition bill So Really Yeah That was the deal for them to get off my back and let me do what I wanted to do I pay half of my everything Was that hard for you Yeah Because my whole first year I didn t work But then ha ha that changed quickly Well actually when I went the whole first year the whole first semester because I worked at the pool on campus for a year Uh huh That was horrible Uh huh Because I m like a lifeguard every summer and this year I had to get a winter job all year And it s hard to go from having like your whole day to go to classes and do whatever you want to do and space out everything then like having to like drive across town and go to work Just to be able to have a job because I m not a big work fan That s probably why I m a theater major so I can kind of you know do what plays I want and then move on Do you think they ve become more ex do you think they ve accepted more what you ve decided to do or that s going to take a while Or if they ever will at all Um my mom has because she knows how important it is to me and everything like that and my dad actually two weeks ago when I went home I don t even remember why I went home but I went home for something and he s like he s still trying to convince me to double major To have something to fall back on and everything like that And I m like I m trying to convince him to you know if I don t make it and there s a strong possibility I won t I know that I m not stupid I m nor going to go to L A and make five million or more than that Right And do all that and I mean if I don t make it my life s not going to be over or something like I can t go back to school So you ll go back to school if that doesn t work out Yeah Did you tell parents that I think they know My mom knows My dad he I don t know he doesn t think I m stupid but he doesn t he wants better for me than what he has He thinks you know it s just kind of that whole thing he wants me to get everything now because he thinks once you re his age it s too late But he realizes it s not like that He could go and make more his self if he would get off his butt and do it What does he do What does he do for a living He s a brick mason which he builds like buildings Oh And he s been doing that since he got out of the hospital He went to college for two weeks and dropped out Oh you re kidding Yeah Like neither like I m the first one in my family to go to college on my dad s side That must be a really big deal Yeah It is That s why it s such like a big thing because my uncle he went he went into the military and then came out I don t know what he sells like cars or something And like my cousins like one of my cousins he s just like slack he dropped out of high school his senior year So I m kind of like the hope I guess That s a little bit of pressure though I guess I don t I kind of don t think about that though because I m like my life is my life you know And like my family s a big part of it I love them all to death but what they do doesn t like reflect who I am Right you know And stuff like that I m kind of going to do what I m going to do That s why I stand out in my family I think that s why they expect so much more of me It kind of gets tiring and that s what I don t like you know I don t like to talk about myself when I go around my family You know they re all like Oh good Da da da da da I m like Do they praise you a lot Yeah And you don t like that I love it I do but it gets to a point where like I feel like if I fail it s just going to be like way too much for everybody And I don t know it s like my grandparents I m the youngest one I m the only girl you know besides my cousin s kids who are like two and three Uh huh So nobody knows what they re going to be yet and considering Chris is raising them that doesn t you know say too much for them two little girls Whose girls My cousin s Oh Oh yeah I m making my family sound really bad but they re really not that bad No Everybody s family is different What does your mom do She s a she works in a warehouse now actually She used to be a waitress for the longest longest time Now she works at US Aid She does packages like First Aid stuff Does she like what she does Uh no No she doesn t at all She waits tables like one night a week at another job to help put me through and everything like that So What do you do Where where are you working now Now I m starting my whole lifeguard thing this summer I m opening up like five pools and they re giving me a headache because they all turned green today so that s like the most fun job for me This is the fourth summer I ve done it So now I m going to run three pools over the summer A big responsibility Yeah but I ve done it for so long I m used to like lifeguard and like everything like that Last year I managed one pool and the other pools are kind of small and like a few of our sisters are working for me So that ll TAPE 1 SIDE B work on stage and then go to L A and work in movies to begin with anyway So you wouldn t stay in Charlotte Your parents will be sad They know I ve told them My dad still doesn t believe me My mom believes me because she knows I ll go But um It s not like I ll never come back and visit or anything like that Like I mean if let s say I make it really big you know big famous person or whatever I ll live here And then I ll go and everything like that when I m big enough to make my decisions on when people are sending me scripts by then instead of me having to like audition and stuff You have a good attitude about it though That s good though you need to I guess You can t go into it and be like Oh I m going to be a big movie star one day and everything like that because the people like that are the ones that are disappointed the most and then like end up nowhere Right You know like I know one day I ll have to sit down and decide if I m where I want to be in life or if I m not And if I m not I ve got to do something about it That s a good attitude Well I definitely think you re going to do something with it and I want to thank you for talking to us No problem Bye
