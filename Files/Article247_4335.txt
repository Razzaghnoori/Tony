 The Iowa Democratic Debate Remembering Lenny I now understand why Gore wants to debate so much On his better days he s damned good at it In today s Des Moines Register debate in Iowa Gore was truly formidable performing better than he has in any of his five previous encounters with Bill Bradley To be sure Gore was demagogic gimmicky and condescending at times he can t help it But he was also lethal throughout Gore s most devastating shot came with the help of what I believe may be a technical innovation in presidential debating the use of human props As he put a question about agriculture to Bradley Gore asked a member of the audience named Chris Peterson to stand Peterson Gore explained was an Iowa farmer with 400 acres 300 of which were flooded in 1993 Bradley Gore noted voted in the Senate against emergency federal aid for those affected Why did you vote against disaster relief for Chris Peterson Gore asked Bradley who should have been prepared to defend this vote simply had no answer at all to the question of why he wanted to drown this friendly looking farmer along with his hogs and beans He tried to play Gore s question off with the lame bromide that the candidates should be talking not about the past but about the future When Gore came back at him again with the question Bradley irrelevantly asserted that he supported the federal tax subsidy for ethanol Bradley was so clearly nailed on this failing to pander charge that Gore was able to resist his usual urge to flog a dead horse and didn t bring it up a third time Though Gore s use of Peterson and of a public school teacher he had also planted in the audience was compelling I don t think it will lead to any good When Ronald Reagan introduced a similar device in his first State of the Union address in 1982 by inviting Lenny Skutnik a government employee who dived into the Potomac to rescue a survivor of an airplane accident it was a nice touch Since then though the heroes in the gallery gambit has gotten completely out of hand turning the State of the Union address into a version of the Grammys for people who can t sing Gore did one other notably shrewd thing this afternoon Responding to Bradley s bunker mentality charge from the last debate he finally stood up and took credit for the record of the Clinton administration The other night in a debate Sen Bradley criticized me and other Democrats for being in what he called a Washington bunker Gore said in his opening statement So I want to start by telling you what we were doing in that Washington bunker We created 20 million new jobs cut the welfare rolls in half passed the toughest gun control in a generation and created the strongest economy in the history of the United States of America I was wondering when Gore was going to get around to sticking up for the president Running away from Clinton as Gore has been doing makes the liability of Clinton fatigue into a self fulfilling prophecy But embracing Clinton s accomplishments plays to what I consider to be Gore s single greatest asset as a candidate that he represents the continuation of Clinton s popular and successful policies without the continuation of Clinton himself
