 What No FDR Building While Chatterbox wasn t paying attention the Old Executive Office Building a grand Second Empire pile that stands beside the White House and houses White House aides who aren t quite important enough to get offices in the executive mansion was renamed the Dwight D Eisenhower Executive Office Building This was apparently in tribute not to Eisenhower but to John Chafee an Eisenhowerish Republican senator from Rhode Island who had sponsored the bill to rename the OEOB as it s known shortly before he died on Oct 26 To read the AP story about all this click here Chatterbox has no problem naming something else in Washington after Eisenhower a great general and a pretty good president there s already a theater named after him in the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts but what about his erstwhile boss Franklin Roosevelt Time is reportedly getting ready to name him Man of the Century and there seems to be general agreement that he was the best president the United States produced during the last 100 years But apart from the FDR Memorial built only a few years ago no other public structure in Washington that Chatterbox can think of is named after him The Roosevelt Bridge is named after Teddy Considering that FDR built much of Washington this seems very unfair FDR buffs who want to set things right are invited to get in touch with one another in the Fray Chatterbox s only request is that they not choose the New Executive Office Building just up the street from the OEOB because it s really ugly
