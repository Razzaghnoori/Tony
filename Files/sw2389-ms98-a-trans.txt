 okay if you want to go first go ahead oh i think i think that the um woman s role has come a long way we ve gone more into the business aspect of uh like i say of i don t know working more and then and we i think we ve even gone into more of the labor aspect of it also yes definitely uh with the pay and everything you know well i feel that uh i we ve missed as far as the top jobs go you know the the higher echelon yeah uh huh because if you look at most corporations there isn t a woman you know that s on the board of directors or that type of thing they re mostly all men there there may be a few but very incidental and uh i i really think that it ll be a long time probably before we see that um hum yeah in one sense um i m i m an older person in my fifties so i feel that we ve lost some things in the sense that women have to work today uh huh you know that that they re not in the home by choice anymore um hum it s most of the time you know even even if you want to say home you can t you really can t oh and a lot of times you can t yeah it s it s it s you you know it s it s gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living and i don t think raises have kept up with you know a lot of the stuff uh you know as far as your medical insurance and uh just groceries and gasoline and all this you know um hum so i think that we we did come a long way in the sense that we have we re allowed to vote in you know like you say we re out in the labor force but i think we ve lost something too yeah my mom um she s a housewife and well there s twelve kids in my family so my mom never could really work you know because she was kind of pregnant from day one she never really had a chance to work oh God love her yeah uh she worked before she got married but um she um she doesn t believe in she s very old fashioned she doesn t believe in the woman working unless she has to that s what i mean and and you know there s a lot of truth to that if you re not going to have a family then that s fine then you you know a career is is a smart choice and i think it s great yeah um hum but if you you have a family i think you owe the family a responsibility um hum and to have children and just get a day care or someone to take care of it and not really have the bonding process that takes place with babies and stuff you know um hum uh i think that both the mother and the child lose and i think that s why there s so many problems you know with kids today because they don t have the family roots anymore yeah you know i m not saying that that it s totally gone but it s nothing like what it used to be yeah uh huh you know in that sense yeah um and also like my mom my mom thinks and i mean she she s kind of right with it when both um partners of of the marriage work she feels that that s taking more away from that s that s increasing more unemployment for people that need to work oh definitely you know like for for the men that don t have jobs if you know she feels that if those women weren t out there just because they want to do it she said that you know they could stay at home and with yeah that s right they don t want to take care of the kids and the house and that kind of thing that s very true but then they shouldn t have a family um hum yeah that s what i m saying you know i i think it s great that women have a choice today um hum that there are ways to prevent families you know like those basically there s contraceptives and all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies there s no need to have children if you don t want them yeah well what what do you think about that do you think that um what do what do you think about the women that are not having families because they want to continue their business that s fine that that s the freedom of choice and i i agree with that because anyone who has children that doesn t really want them isn t going to be a good parent i uh huh uh huh uh well i shouldn t say they re not going to be a good parent they won t be a caring parent like they won t have that uh um hum or they won t be as good as they could be right that s that s what i mean it they ll feel like it s uh a job um hum it s it s not like something that they really wanted like i had three children and i mean i i i wanted every one of them um hum i m not sorry i had any of them and i worked third shift for a good part of my life just so i would be home with them yeah you know i had to work but i tried to make it as painless as possible uh huh in fact at one time i worked as a second shift and uh uh one Saturday morning we were all sitting at the breakfast table and the kids were talking daddy this daddy that daddy this daddy that and i was sitting there it was like i didn t belong anymore and it was because i had worked for about nine months and when they were coming home i was going to work uh huh and i wasn t there at supper time or bed time or they couldn t tell me what went on at school because they d be coming in the door i d be going out exactly so we were i i felt i was losing my family uh huh and that s why i said that s it i either have to quit or you know try something else so i went on third shift um hum and i worked that shift for eleven years oh my yeah Bless you yeah just so that my kids would would have me at home uh huh you know and i feel that s very important it really is and it s too bad because because mothers miss out on so much too so i mean in the sense that we ve come a long way yes but we ve sacrificed a lot to get there um hum yeah i i agree and uh i really think that if uh like after second World War when women went to work in factories and all that that was like out of necessity because the men weren t here anymore uh huh but then it got to be a point where they got some independence and they just enjoyed the income the extra exactly a man can afford the necessities a woman affords the luxuries um hum and i notice today s uh kids you know like we had apartments before we had homes um hum and we had to walk before we had a car exactly and now kids at sixteen years old they have their birthday what what do they get they get a car oh i know and uh it to me it s like we ve lost our values in this country uh huh we really have and i i m not trying to be uh you know a prude or old fashioned or anything but i i don t think if you unless you earn something and you ve worked for it and you have a sense of pride about it because while i did this in uh you know no one gave it to me um hum you ll take better care of that and you ll prize that possession more than someone handing something to you exactly um hum and it s just like college too i think that if a kid goes to college and you can help them fine but i don t think you should pay the whole way see yeah see now um my parents there s no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college and um of course so far there s only two of us that have gone and my older brother has paid his entire way and i m on my i have six weeks left for and i ll you know i ll graduate and i paid my entire way and that s the way it ll go down the line and yeah like we i don t have a car because i m paying for college and if i want a car my parents always said if we wanted a car we paid for the car and we paid for our own insurance and and i think that s right because sure but i ll bet your values are a lot higher you know your your and your self esteem and the way the way you uh you know think about things is probably a lot more common sense um hum yeah than these kids that don t have that responsibility um hum like i ve had my you know like um like i know kids up here that have their own cars their money s just given to them like they still get their allowance they re twenty years old and they still get an allowance you that that well i ve held a summer job since i you know i was in the eleventh grade sure yeah and i have had to take care of my own money i have my own checking account i pay for my own life insurance and i know a lot of kids that don t even know what i mean i tell them i pay for my own life insurance and their mouths just drop to the floor you know sure they probably don t even have any well if they do they don t know of it you know or yeah exactly and that s what i say you ll you ll be you ll be so much better off for it as you get older because you know a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and and stuff but it s because you ve been there uh huh and no one can tell anyone anything anything you know you re going to find out for yourself but i mean i don t think you should just not listen to advice even if you don t take it just listen oh i know uh huh you know there s there s no harm in that whereas sometimes you can t even get that from a kid you know just attention you know uh huh but really uh what what do you feel the changes in the future like with the abortions and that type of thing women in politics and um president someday maybe actually i think abortion s going to take a turn where there s not going to be as many because i think contraceptives are going to be more popular i mean i realize that they are popular now but i think yeah yeah i i really i really think people are going to start using more contraceptives and with the abortion it i i don t think there s going to be many abortions but i don t know what women will do when they get into politics you know about abortion yeah yeah i think it ll be freedom of choice well i i still think people have a choice i you know if you can live with it and it s not you know your conscience is clear uh huh then i mean all all of us are going to answer to it one day maybe or maybe not i don t know i mean no one s said for sure you know exactly yeah um hum yeah but uh i think if a woman would get into politics or enough women get into politics i definitely i think it ll definitely be freedom of choice yes yes um hum which i mean i think it should be anyway i i do i m Catholic and i we we re not supposed to you know say that that s okay but i really feel that it s freedom of choice no yeah because i mean you as an individual what you would do that that to me is your business i do um hum and uh and and different circumstances call for different things exactly exactly that s
