and have made a number of requests to Bloomingdale s for a digital version of the bridal registry They offered to fax me information I told them I don t do faxes anymore Mike and Ellen the to be wedded parties are true digerati and have the expectation of electronic invitations with embedded links to Bloomie s for example for this bicoastal event in June Do you think I m expecting too much of Bloomie s Their Web site is lame and they don t seem to understand e commerce in the e world I do not want to be impolite but I do want them to understand the lucrativeness of this burgeoning market Mike and Ellen s wedding helper needs your guidance Wedded digitally Dear Wed Ah yes trouble with cybergifts Prudie is sorry for your frustration with Bloomie s being behind the e commerce curve Would you feel better to know that they sometimes screw up their plain old fashioned mail order business A friend of Prudie s ordered an expensive lamp as a wedding gift and the embarrassed groom inquired why she had sent an embroidered footstool bearing the wrong initials In defense of some high end retailers steering clear of the Web Saks announced they were aborting their Net effort because the results were next to nil This the store believed was due to the fact that catalogs show the merchandise more clearly and that selecting things is a touching and feeling exercise The Tish Baldridge part of Prudie s brain is a little put off by the idea of imbedded Web links to stores This makes the invitation seem a little more like an invoice than usual But by all means send Prudie s best to Mike and Ellen Prudie festively Dear Prudie My problem is one that I m sure affects many more women than you d believe I was widowed when I was 47 and have been on my own for five years My situation is something of a good news bad news thing The couples who were our friends have been wonderful to me They include me in everything something I know is unusual for a single woman The problem though is that not one of them has ever fixed me up with a man And it s not that they don t know any I m assuming they never think of me in this context because to them I was the other half of a couple with Rob and it would somehow be disloyal on their part to introduce me to other men I do not wish to seem aggressive but my friends are well connected and I don t know how to tell them that I am ready for introductions Any ideas JoAnne in Minnesota Dear Jo It sounds as if your friends are keeping you in widow s weeds longer than is necessary Ideally you would be able to include a gentleman you ve met independently in a function involving all the old friends thereby making a statement If no one suitable has crossed your radar mention to some of the women not the men that you are ready to meet appropriate escorts and perhaps they know of someone In other words spread the word And the reason to tell the women not the men is that it s been observed that women cannot accept the idea of any man being on his own So once you ve deputized the women in your group Prudie predicts results Prudie providentially Dear Prudie I feel so hopelessly clueless I m seeing an older man who works in the same company I do He is paid at least twice what I am and is well aware of that fact and dips into his salary only when he runs short of trust fund money He s obviously made a killing in the latest stock market boom Yet when we go out we split expenses When this man and I first started seeing one another I would offer to split the check not being of the persuasion that the man should automatically pay But it s been almost a year now and we ve grown close if you get my drift What s going on Wish I Were Making This Up Dear Wish What s going on is that your gentleman is close with a buck To louse up a well known Latin phrase he is fui generis in this case meaning What s mine is mine Unfortunately to be politically correct in the beginning you suggested going Dutch Now that you have become close drift received and your significant other is way better fixed than you Prudie suggests you have a heart to heart An opening gambit might be I can no longer afford our romance Explain that when you started dating you didn t know it would lead to something serious and wished to be correct Now however you think it would be appropriate for him to assume the expenses incurred when you are a twosome As of course you know money can be the Bermuda Triangle of relationships If this is a thorn in your side and Prudie believes it is state your case but be prepared to be disappointed If he doesn t see it your way just e mail him a farewell at www cheapskate com Prudie fiscally Dear Prudie Is it moral for the government to refuse to provide sterile needles to groups of intravenous drug users in order to prevent the spread of AIDS Does the excuse that needle exchange encourages and condones drug use seem reasonable David WorlRochester N Y Dear David You have pressed one of Prudie s buttons with this one Statistics show that needle exchange programs among other benefits are a way of getting people into rehab The government is being both foolish and cowardly afraid of being attacked by conservatives for doing anything that might be labeled immoral The real immorality of course is failing to do whatever is possible to lessen illness and disease To imagine that withholding clean needles from addicts will keep them away from drugs is like telling the tides to stay still Prudie disdainfully
