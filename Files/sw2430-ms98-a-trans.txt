        well what is it that you prefer to provide as far as maintenance on your vehicle   i do all my own maintenance matter of fact i just finished putting a timing chain in my wifes Toyota  i do i do all of that myself   wow how about that that im not quite as mechanically inclined although that some of the the basic things that you need to do for uh the maintenance of your warranty on a vehicle   oh sure sure   is is stuff that you can do yourself just the oil uh changed and things of that nature thats about where i my expertise ends in in that category just you know   well theres two things that drive that up here one is we is the lack of good service people   umhum   because there just arent are not any left hardly around up in this area   i believe that   and the other thing is the cost its almost prohibitive to bring it to a dealer   boy i tell you i just got my car back from a dealer and when it was in there i had them just go ahead and change the oil and filter thirty four dollars   oh sure sure the the price is astronomical but what i do is i like to do this okay and i and i i like to play with mechanics and thats i really ive done that all my life so   huh well thats uh thats quite a savings having that talent   and the the little the little Toyota is a nineteen eighty three so  i really dont have too much to lose if i mess it up too bad you know   how many miles there is that now what did you just replace   the timing chain well the camshaft timing chain   now im not even familiar with what that where that is   okay its in the front of the engine uh say like directly behind the radiator or the water pump   umhum   and it it drives from the crankshaft it drives uh a chain that drives the camshaft which is an overhead cam in those foreign cars   umhum   and uh it it was getting kind of worn the car has a hundred and one thousand miles on it and it was getting a little noisy so   hm   not so much for the noise but if it were to jump a tooth or something of that nature i would be in serious problems on the freeway and i didnt want to chance Irene driving the car like that so   sure well how much how long did it take to replace that   i oh three nights i worked on it three nights and about four hours on last Saturday and i just put it in the garage and worked on it i have i have a new Oldsmobile so i really   uhhuh   uh its its its just a little hobby and if its not too cold outside and the weathers starting to get pretty nice so if its not too too cold out i can go out work on it dont have heat in the garage or anything but   oh sure umhum how much would uh something like that cost in the garage   uh well i figured if i had it done in the garage at the Toyota dealer i would be looking at probably three or four hundred dollars   jimminy   between the gasket kit and the new distributor cap i put on and the new uh chain and the labor   and how much do you think the parts was by itself   well the parts to to me i spent twenty two dollars on the parts   oh really   yeah   wow   so i really i really dont have heart burn at all with doing it myself over four nights tie i tied the car up if four days but were fortunate we didnt need it   oh gosh yeah four at a hundred dollars a night thats not still not too bad   no i know but you know you you save the markup on the parts and of course you buy them whole sale from the parts store and and you can save a little bit there and you can save an awful lot on the labor which is high today like all the rest of us we expect top dollar for what we do and   sure   i dont i dont blame the garage people its just that its very very hard to find anybody here thats willing to do that type of work   umhum   all of our so called garages are now a convenience stores that sell gasoline and they really dont do any repairs anymore so you know youre youre youre youre almost tied to the dealer to go back to them and   right exactly   well it seems like theyre just swamped with work so   well yeah well unfortunately i just had replaced the the power antenna uh you know it kind of dumb having the garage door i drove out before the door was completely up and the radio was on so it took off the antenna   sure sure   but the mast itself cost uh thirty four two dollars   uhhuh   and i went i called the dealer and they wanted two hundred and twenty to put it in   sure and thats thats held in by two bolts and a bracket and a plug of wire in the bottom of it no   and gosh and then i went to well it i i looked at it myself to see if i could do it myself because i you know i i feel im so pretty competent and handy but unfortunately unfortunately they buried this one in the sixty six Mazdas you have to remove the dash and the fuse box to get to the motor   im sure you could of uhhuh uhhuh   and so they say theres uh three hours of labor just to uncover where the the metal shaft goes in because it goes through the through the door in between the windshield and the drivers side door and comes out above the drivers head   okay yeah thats one of those that sits up at an angle back there yeah okay yeah yeah   yeah so its terribly engineered   well thats thats another problem you know and if you dont have all these special tools of course like i said were very fortunate with the older cars we can work on them what um if you dont have all the special tools and the technology i id i would hate to buy a brand new car today with the electronics that are in them   everything was visible oh yeah   i imagine that would be a bear to work on you know uh   anymore just putting everything on a chip is your going to have to replace the chip unless you have the tools to diagnose whats the problem with the chip   sure uhhuh yes thats absolutely true uh have you done have you done much repair work yourself other other than just routine maintenance like oil changes and stuff   but i had a a seventy nine Mustang uh Mazda RX   yeah   first year of the rotary engine that i used to do i used to work on because it you know heck seventy nine if i was to do something screw it up electrically uh i could i handled everything i put in antennas there you know the power antenna the replacement parts all that kind of thing   sure   but when it came to ever giving kind any kind of tune ups or things like that id take it into the shop anything basically with the yeah   that rotary engine always fascinated me i was i was always enthralled by the rotary engine i think thats a neat idea and im surprised we havent gone that way more and and   yeah and they just stop making them now   yep yep   so its kind of interesting when its work great smooth   its a smooth running quiet car i i just i dont know why well perhaps the the retooling cost were probably prohibitive to most companies you know   i suppose but i had a hundred and twenty eight thousand on it when i sold it   the uh the automotive industry is in dire needs of something in this in this country and its too bad uh the Toyota we bought i i bought second hand i did not buy it new uh   yeah umhum   but if you look at whats in that little car and as opposed to whats in some of the American cars you can see where were probably a half a step behind and i think i think were trying to do something to correct that but i think we got away from us a little bit so   yeah   but i i i i just like i say to work on it myself i one i like to do that uh i i think i would do all of the maintenance i change my own oil and i change of course spark plugs and stuff like that thats routine that i i would call routine maintenance once a year i do that every fall i get ready for the winter   umhum   and i even lubricate the car myself because i have a i have means of of running it up on on jack stands and and you know i have a creeper and i crawl around underneath it so its not a big deal   wow sure sure   but even today like with your waste oil when you drain the oil and change the oil now i have to bring it to a disposal center i can i no longer can put it in in the trash you know or in a container yeah we have      oh really   were were really on an ecology kick up here i guess like all the rest of the country and   well thats good   and and they really really they come down and pound you real hard if they catch you dumping oil on the ground because it does go in and it effects the lakes and streams and it eventually winds up on the ocean here and it really makes a mess around around New England   sure   so we have to take the oil to uh a uh a disposal center thats an EPA you know authorized disposal center   umhum   and they gladly take it but they only take it like for two hours on a Saturday morning you know and its it gets to be a pain sometime to go through that but i think its still worth it in the long run   right   because oil you can buy for eighty five cents a quart but if you buy that same oil at a dealer its going to cost you probably two dollars a quart   sure sure of course   and uh and now the labor to put it in   of course   and uh i i again i like to do that i i would do all the maintenance on my car if i could uh   umhum   you know even even into major things just to keep our car longer because i dont think we get the money that we put into them out of them in two years or three years and of course i was never in a position where i could trade my car off every two years   right well it seems like youve got a very valuable talent   uh well i i like i said ive done mechanics all my life and i do that with the company so uh im a senior engineer for them so i am mechanics and i i just uh i enjoy it i really its like a diversion for me i i think if i had to do it   oh great   if i had to do automotive repair or or anything i love to do woodwork and too and its a diversion because i know id really dont have to this okay so i think i like that because i know i dont have to do this but if if i were forced to do it that may be a different situation   hum yeah thats true well its been good talking to you   uh it sure has i really appreciate your call and uh  its nice to talk with you folks from from down in the in the main office area and   every once in a while down here at the main site   yeah sure hows your weather its pretty good   oh its been beautiful   yeah were just starting to get some nice little warm
