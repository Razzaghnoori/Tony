                alright   okay   okay um so what kind of uh uh piece of property have you got   weve got a home and uh very large front and back yard we had a lot of Dallas grass what they call Dallas Dallas grass and others  parts of country call Crab grass that real thick grass and we had a problem with that but weve seemed tove taken care of it how about you   um umhum umhum well um i um up here we dont have too much trouble with Crab grass or anything like that um uh weve uh like we rent the house that we live in but weve got a pretty large piece of uh land that we live on even though very close into Washington DC   umhum   and so most of the work that we have to do involves mowing the lawn and um uh uh my sweetheart who i live with uh does a lot of uh flower gardening and stuff around the house she gets a lot of pleasure from that   what flowers does she like   hm um well it changes from year to year and shes thinking this year shes gonna get into bulbs and that sort of thing but most of the sorts of things that she uh has grown in the past have been um i guess wild flowers and uh some stuff that our neighbors sort of brings over periodically shes also she likes things like Hollyhocks and uh Peonies and and uh oh lets what else has she got oh the other things shes really into is Morning Glories and uh in the summer time we have Morning Glories just all over the house its great all different colors   umhum yeah they climb too   yeah its its a lot of fun its real pleasant in fact our next door neighbor in Christmas time this year couldnt resist giving us a set of coffee cups had Morning Glories all over them       and uh she she found them and she said oh i just had to buy them for you but uh were also really into vegetable gardening   do you have a problem with any type of uh insects or gophers or anything     actually yeah actually we do we we dont have any um any uh you know varmints or anything like that       that that tend to bother the garden but we do have a lot of trouble with insects particularly caterpillars um weve had very very poor luck with uh all of the core crops and like um uh and cabbage and and uh broccoli and  cauliflower and that sort of   if you uh sprinkle lime on your young plants before they get too big that should help that   uhhuh well thats um exactly what weve done and youre youre advice is is dead on in in our experience in fact uh thing that weve found works even better than lime is diatomaceous earth   yeah that works thats kind of hard to get a hold of sometimes   uh yeah well um Jackie got a hold of a huge box of it so much of it that i dare say that well probably still using be using it five years from now       she went out to some uh pool supply place and and got this huge box of it and its really its big and she came home with it and she was real proud and she said okay well weve got a lifetime supply now so weve got no excuse and uh     what vegetables do you grow the most   well we uh have uh i guess in the last two or three years really discovered that were really fond of hot peppers and so um we grow tomatoes down one side of the house where we get a lot of sun and then in our regular garden plot this past uh couple of years weve grown a lot of different varieties of hot peppers     do you have jalapenos   uh yes which of course are our favorites and uh but weve also grown a lot of real um uh hot uh smaller varieties like Tais and um     umhum do you have the small red ones cayenne   uh yeah yeah the cayennes and weve even grown some little funny uh uh peppers and ive never ive never been sure one of them i believe is called Chili Tepid and the other one is called Pequine and um theyre theyre little tiny hot things that we she takes them inside and she dries them and then we eat and   ive heard of the Chili but ive never heard of the Pequine what are they are they green red and yellow what   theyre little green literally pea size peppers theyre theyre just little tiny guys and they dry up even smaller than they are when theyre theyre you know fresh food on the um   umhum   the plant but the plants are just incredibly prodigious they just produce zillions of them um     what do you use them for mainly   uh all kinds of dishes we like i say we grind them up and um we freeze some of them and then use them in stews and uh whenever we make egg dishes or anything like that we tend to       to put some on it its just incredible with the numbers of ways that we come up to use them and uh its its funny i mean we were laughing at ourselves one night because we uh we realized that um we had uh  we were having it with every meal       but anyway it its uh its something that we enjoy immensely and it we get a lot of pleasure out of i love tilling up the garden every year and um uh you know getting out there and just spending some
