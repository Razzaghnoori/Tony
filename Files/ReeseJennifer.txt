 Can I talk now Yeah go ahead and try it OK I was four years old from what my mom tells me I was four years old and I was walking on the beach with my grandfather and apparently I stepped on a sticker bush and I had like four stickers in my foot And it just stressed me terribly and I was crying and crying and I kept on just saying I need a doctor I need a doctor Get me a doctor And I guess my grandfather convinced me to take them out of my foot and I lived to tell this story Good thing Well Okey dokey Um let s see some other stories that I remember let me think Stop me can I stop me while I think Um um What stories do you tell Gage Like books do you read to him Um we read what do we read We read all kinds of books Whatever he pulls off of the shelf And he has a hundred books What s his favorite Um he doesn t really have a favorite he picks whichever one is going that night He just got a book it s called um Eagle Boy and it s about a um a Indian tribe on the CA coast who does uh they run out of food in the area where they are And Anyway so it s about this Indian tribe on the CA coast and wherever they are they run out of food and they decide that they have to move Well this one little boy had always um been real nice to the eagles and thought they were really cool and all this and um for whatever reason the tribe decides that they need to leave him behind and they leave him on the beach as they paddle off Well he was starving and an eagle came by and dropped a salmon down for him or some fish and he was able to eat And it s because he had always been nice to the eagles and talked to the eagles and all that and they saw that he was in trouble Well he really liked one of the little girls who had gone off with the rest of the tribe and so he told the eagles to drop her some food because he knew they were starving too and the eagle did And then they realized that it was all because of the him that the eagles were dropping them food and so they came back and got him and it was one big happy tribe again And the little girl and boy married and lived happily ever after And so that one he just got and he likes that one Um he likes what other stories do we tell He really likes to make up stories He ll like it s usually about a Power Ranger And the Power Ranger has to overcome some huge enemy and it s usually a bloody battle but the Power Ranger always wins He ll make up those from Eden to Greensboro which is 40 minutes long and you have to do it And so he that he usually does that with his grandmother and they make up a story the whole way home And he tries to get me to do it but I cannot talk to like that 40 minutes so we just usually make it halfway with our stories Um what other stories do we tell Any good life experience stories No Um we tell Gage about like we ll tell him about like if you do this you know could be hurt Like um When I was little I knew a boy who stuck his head out and got hit by the by the telephone pole while he was in the car and killed him Don t stick your head out Um like when he one time we were at my mom s house and she had just made pies and he saw them come out of the oven and he knew they were hot but it had been sitting on the stove for a little bit And he went up to grab it and he burned his fingers and so we told him you know times that we burned ourselves and that it hurts and that it will stop And plus you know Rob can talk away fire so we had to call Daddy and tell him to talk away Rob Gage s fire And um so we tell him about that How does Rob talk away this fire He he does some I don t know See he can t tell you but he does something like this and then he has to know your birth date your birth date your age I don t know something else and it it works I m not kidding It makes things stop hurting It makes your burn stop hurting The next time you burn call Rob and he ll say How old are you and what s your birthday and then you just hang up and it will go away He does he says something it s very weird I m being serious though it works I ve burned myself and called him and he does it and it stops hurting Now maybe if I never called him it would just stop hurting anyway but I don t know So Rob can do that Let s see what s another story Um what s something else Anything good you remember just like childhood story like something you did when you were a child teenager No teenager
