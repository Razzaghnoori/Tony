 Background The adult mammalian ovary is a complex tissue composed of four fundamental cell types the oocytes granulosa interstitial and corpora luteal cells Within this basic quartet are many other cell types such as the ovary surface epithelium and blood vessels in addition to the classic subtypes of granulosa membrana periantral cumulus and corona radiata theca interna and externa and luteal cells granulosa and theca lutein The coordinated control of proliferation differentiation and apoptosis in these cell types is the underlying basis for primate and non primate menstrual and estrous cycles respectively The process by which each cell type obtains its state of differentiation is the subject of intense study The role of hormones in this process is clear however new results indicate that autocrine paracrine or growth factor mechanisms also have important roles The bone morphogenetic protein BMP family including ligands receptors and binding proteins has emerged as a central player in ovary physiology and female fertility 1 The BMPs represent a large subclass of the transforming growth factor TGF surperfamily of ligands whose biological responses are mediated by Ser Thr kinase receptors via the Smad signaling molecules 2 The mRNAs encoding several BMP family members have been identified in the murine ovary including the ligands BMP 2 3 BMP 3 3 BMP 3b 3 BMP 4 4 BMP 6 5 BMP 7 4 BMP 15 6 7 8 the BMP receptors BMPR IA BMPR IB and BMPR II 4 and the BMP binding protein follistatin FS 9 In the murine BMP 4 and 7 mRNA have been identified in the theca interstitial cells 4 BMP 6 and 15 in oocytes 5 6 7 8 BMPR IA BMPR IB and BMPR II in oocytes and granulosa cells GCs 4 and FS in granulosa and lutein cells 9 10 The direct involvement of the BMP system in regulating ovary function has been established In vitro experiments with rat GCs have demonstrated that BMP 4 and 7 inhibit and stimulate FSH induced progesterone and estradiol production respectively 4 In related studies BMP 6 and BMP 15 were found to block FSH action through inhibiting FSH dependent adenylate cyclase activity and FSH receptor expression respectively 11 12 The importance of these findings is underscored by the fact that FSH action is obligatory for normal folliculogenesis and female fertility In addition BMP 7 and 15 but not BMP 6 have stimulatory effects on GC DNA synthesis indicating they may play a mitogenic role in follicle growth 8 12 13 The importance of this finding is underscored by the fact that the control of GC proliferation is crucial for follicle dominance and atresia Equally important other studies have shown that loss of function and naturally occurring mutations in BMP ligands and receptors are associated with dysregulation of folliculogenesis and ovulation 14 15 16 17 18 19 Of particular interest is the finding that ewes having a mutation in the bmp15 gene in both alleles are infertile whereas the heterozygotes are superfertile 16 Thus the bmp15 gene can control ovulation quota through a dosage sensitive mechanism Evidence that a mutation at the Ser Thr kinase domain of BMPR IB leads to high fecundity in ewes 17 18 19 provides further support that BMP signaling pathways play a key role in specifying ovary function Although it is becoming clear that intrinsic BMPs are important players in the ovary the cellular localization of BMPs in the ovary is poorly understood and a proper understanding of how the cell specific expression of the BMP system changes during the cycle is still lacking As part of our ongoing investigations of the roles of BMPs in ovary physiology we have analyzed the spatiotemporal expression patterns of the BMP system in the rat ovary cell types during the normal estrous cycle Materials and Methods Animals Adult female Sprague Dawley rats 2 3 months of age were housed four animals per cage in isolation under controlled lighting conditions 14 h of light 10 hr of darkness lights on from 0500 to 1900 h at 23 C and provided formulated rat chow and water ad libitum Vaginal smears were taken daily and rats exhibiting two or more consecutive 4 day estrous cycles were used The animals two at each time of the cycle were sacrificed on proestrus P1000 and 2000 h estrus E0200 and E1000 h diestrus I DI 1100 h and diestrus II DII 1100 h The rats were handled in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocols were approved by the University of California San Diego Animal Subjects Committee Plasmid construction for synthesizing riboprobes Probes for in situ hybridization studies were made by RT PCR Total RNA from adult rat ovaries was prepared and single stranded cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcriptase and then subjected to PCR as described previously 20 To design primers for PCR DNA sequence information was first collected from GenBank and primers for PCR were designed based on standard guidelines All sequence information was derived from rat cDNA clones except for BMP 2 7 BMPR IB and BMPR II whose cDNA sequences in rat have not been deposited into the GenBank However because cDNA sequences in human and mouse are available from the GenBank we designed the PCR primers by choosing the homologous DNA sequence regions between human and mouse homologues Specifically these primers are derived from the cDNA clones at the following

accession number AF003942 for BMPR II 25 These primers were selected from different exons of the corresponding genes to discriminate PCR products that might arise from possible chromosome DNA contaminants All PCR products were cloned into pBluescript SK and their DNA sequences confirmed The plasmid containing FS was constructed by sub cloning of the XbaI PstI fragment derived for rat FS cDNA clone 9 pROF304 into pBluescript SK In situ hybridization Ovaries were fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde at 4 C washed in PBS dehydrated and embedded in paraffin Eight consecutive sections 8 m were cut from each ovary and mounted onto poly L lysine coated glass slides The sections were digested with proteinase K acetylated washed and dehydrated as previously described 10 26 Anti sense and sense cRNA probes were prepared by means of in vitro transcription using T3 or T7 RNA polymerase Hybridization was carried out with the 35S labeled RNA probe 4 6 10 6cpm ml in a solution containing 50 vol vol deionized formamide 0 3 M NaCl 10 mM Tris pH 8 2 1 mM EDTA 0 05 yeast tRNA 10 mM dithiothreitol 1 Denhardt s solution and 10 dextran sulfate Hybridization solution 20 l was placed over each section and covered with a 60 22 mm acid washed siliconized coverslip Coverslips were sealed with liquid DPX Sections were hybridized for 16 h at 58 60 C in a humidified chamber After hybridization the sections were treated with ribonuclease A and washed in 15 mM NaCl 1 5 mM sodium citrate at 60 62 C for 30 min Dehydrated slides were exposed to X ray film for several days After adequate X ray film images were obtained the ovary sections were treated with xylene rinsed in 100 ethanol air dried and then coated with Kodak NTB 2 liquid autoradiograph emulsion Slides were exposed for four weeks at 4 C in a linedesiccated dark box After exposure the slides were developed Kodak D19 3 5 min 14 C rinsed briefly in distilled water and fixed After washing in distilled water for 1 h slides were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin After an autoradiography and counterstaining the sections were analyzed microscopically The in situ experiments were performed two times for each BMP ligand and receptor The intensity of the hybridization signals were determined as previously reported 26 27 28 A subjective comparison of eight sections from each ovary from six animals hybridized with the same concentrations of sense and antisense cRNAs and exposed for the same time 4 weeks was made The hybridization signal was estimated on a scale of 1 to 4 as originally described by Meunier 29 silver grains sparse but positive hybridization silver grains are numerous but do not cover the cell type in question silver grains are very numerous and begin to merge in some places silver grains are very dense and form a near uniform mass above the cell type in question there was heterogeneity in the hybridization signal e g some of the histological units contained a signal others did not no detectable hybridization signal The slides were analyzed simultaneously by two investigators and the results confirmed independently by another researcher In each experiment tissues hybridized with the sense probe were used as the negative control In all cases the sense probes showed no specific hybridization to the adult ovaries above background see for example Fig 1C Results Expression of BMP 2 mRNA In adult rat ovaries BMP 2 mRNA is highly expressed in the GC of atretic follicles and at relatively high levels in the GC of Graafian follicles GF and some corpora lutea CL Table 1 Fig 1A 1B BMP 2 mRNA is also expressed at lower levels in the secondary interstitial cells SIC and theca interstitial cells TIC but undetectable in other ovary cell types Table 1 In the SIC BMP 2 mRNA was constitutively expressed at low to moderate levels over the cycle A weak variable expression was sometimes seen in the TIC Table 1 In the GC BMP 2 mRNA is expressed in a precise manner indicating that gene activity is regulated during follicle development A weak hybridization signal was first detected in some GC of early primary follicles consistent with BMP 2 gene activation during recruitment As folliculogenesis progressed BMP 2 mRNA expression increased rapidly reaching maximal levels in the GC of secondary follicles The expression of GC BMP 2 mRNA was heterogeneous In preantral follicles BMP 2 mRNA expression was confined mainly to the membrana GC with little or no expression in the corona radiata GC next to the oocyte Fig 1D 1E This indicates that the GC become functionally diverse very early in follicle development i e about the time the follicle has two layers of GC As the follicle undergoes its development to the preovulatory stage i e from selection at E 0200 h through ovulation at E 0200 h the next cycle the membrana but not the cumulus and periantral GC express high levels of BMP 2 mRNA Fig 1F 1G These findings indicate that the oocyte may regulate GC BMP 2 gene expression by a morphogen gradient mechanism Finally the highest levels of BMP 2 mRNA in the ovary were seen in the GC of atretic follicles Fig 1H 1I BMP 2 mRNA expression in the dominant follicle was rapidly down regulated following ovulation As such there was no detectable BMP 2 mRNA in the new CL I during luteinization i e E 2000 h to DI 1100 h Fig 1J 1K The message was re expressed at DII 1100 h luteolysis with strong hybridization for BMP 2 appearing in clusters of endothelial cells scattered throughout the CL I Fig 1A 1B 1L 1M This correlation suggests a possible function for endothelial derived BMP 2 in luteolysis Fig 1N Expression of BMP 3 and 3b mRNA The hybridization signal for BMP 3 was relatively weak in the ovaries examined data not shown BMP 3 mRNA expression was present in the TIC of healthy Graafian follicles and in the theca lutein cells TLC of the CL I at DI 1100 h Table 1 This is consistent with a role for theca derived BMP 3 in regulating the dominant follicle and CL A strong expression of BMP 3b mRNA was seen in some ovaries Table 1 During folliculogenesis the theca cells T of the theca interna TI and externa TE of dominant follicles strongly expressed BMP 3b mRNA Fig 2A 2B 2C In the TI the expression appeared mainly in the TIC located nearest the TE Fig 2C After ovulation the signal was reduced In the CL I BMP 3b mRNA was expressed at low to moderate levels in the TLC and TE cells during luteinization Fig 2D 2E Little or no BMP 3b mRNA was evident in degenerating CL Table 1 Fig 2A 2B Interestingly there was high expression in the ovary surface epithelium OSE Fig 2F and in the epithelial cells of the sex cords SC located in the hilum of the ovary Fig 2G In atretic follicles BMP 3b mRNA expression was undetectable Fig 2H 2I Expression of BMP 4 mRNA BMP 4 mRNA was expressed in a variety of ovary cell types with the highest levels appearing in the theca CL OSE SC and endothelium of some blood vessels Table 1 Fig 3A 3B 3C BMP 4 mRNA was constitutively expressed at high levels in both the SC Fig 3C and the endothelium lining the large sinusoids in the mesovarium Fig 3D A weak hybridization signal was occasionally seen in some oocytes of primary follicles but it was rare In the theca the levels of BMP 4 mRNA change during folliculogenesis A weak BMP 4 signal was first detectable in primary follicles being localized to a few stroma fibroblasts near the basal lamina This finding is consistent with the intriguing idea that the theca may begin to develop very early in preantral folliculogenesis i e during the initial steps of primary follicle development In secondary follicles BMP 4 mRNA was present at moderate levels in an outer layer of flattened cells the TE and in a subset of TIC adjacent to these cells Fig 3E 3F 3G BMP 4 mRNA was expressed at high levels in the theca of developing dominant follicles again being localized to the TE and adjacent TIC Fig 3H 3I 3J Unlike healthy follicles BMP 4 mRNA was very low or undetectable in atretic follicles High levels of BMP 4 mRNA continue to be expressed in the TE of the CL throughout luteogenes i e luteinization E 0200 h to DI 1100 h and luteolysis DII 1100 h to E 0200 h the next cycle Fig 3K 3L A potentially important finding is that the OSE covering the ovulated follicle and newly formed CL I expressed high levels of BMP 4 mRNA while little or no BMP 4 mRNA was detected in other areas of the surface epithelium Fig 3M 3N 3O This is consistent with a role for BMP 4 in OSE regeneration following ovulation Expression of BMP 6 mRNA BMP 6 mRNA was present in the oocytes GC CL blood vessels and the OSE Table 1 Fig 4A 4B In the vascular system BMP 6 mRNA was continuously expressed at relatively high levels in the endothelial cells of some large arteries and veins in the medulla Fig 4C Thus BMP 6 like BMP 4 could have a role in ovarian blood circulation BMP 6 mRNA showed relatively high expression in the OSE throughout the cycle suggesting a general non regulated role for BMP 6 in the OSE and or adjacent tissues Fig 4A 4B The expression of BMP 6 mRNA in oocytes was developmentally regulated There was no detectable BMP 6 mRNA in primordial and primary follicles Table 1 however a weak hybridization signal was detected in oocytes of early secondary follicles when the second layer of GCs was forming Fig 4D Thereafter expression increased sharply and was maximal in oocytes after the fourth layer of GC had developed Fig 4E 4F High levels of BMP 6 mRNA were present in oocytes of all Graafian follicles both healthy and atretic Fig 4A 4B 4E 4F 4G 4H 4I 4J The developmental changes in oocyte BMP 6 mRNA expression showed no obvious cyclic variation Like oocytes BMP 6 mRNA was first detected in the GC at the early secondary stage Expression increased as the follicle grew and was maximal after the fourth layer of GC had formed Fig 4D 4E 4F In the preantral follicles only the membrana GC expressed BMP 6 mRNA consistent with a role of the oocyte in regulating GC BMP 6 expression Fig 4E 4F BMP 6 mRNA was not detectable in the GC of dominant follicles Fig 4G 4H This loss of BMP 6 mRNA became evident soon after selection at E 0200 h and continued through dominant follicle development This suggests the inhibition of GC BMP 6 gene activity may be required for the formation of dominant follicles The finding that BMP 6 mRNA is strongly expressed in GC during atresia Fig 4I 4J is consistent with this idea It is notable that BMP 6 mRNA was expressed in the TE of the CL I from ovulation throughout luteolysis Fig 4A 4B 4K 4L Expression of BMP 7 mRNA As with BMP 4 relatively high expression of BMP 7 mRNA was identified in the theca CL and SC Table 1and Fig 5A 5B 5C A specific pattern of BMP 7 expression was identified in the theca during folliculogenesis and luteogenesis The theca of developing follicles first exhibited BMP 7 mRNA when the second layer of GC appeared i e at the primary secondary follicle transition Table 1 Subsequent follicle growth was accompanied by increased BMP 7 mRNA expression which reached high levels in the theca of dominant follicles Fig 5D 5E An intriguing feature of theca BMP 7 mRNA expression is that it restricted to the inner most layer being present in a subset of fibroblast like cells juxtaposed to the basal lamina and a sub population of adjacent TIC Fig 5D 5E 5F Notably this pattern of theca BMP 7 mRNA expression is just the opposite of BMP 4 mRNA whose expression is limited to the outer half of the theca These observations are consistent with the novel concept that the TIC of the TI represent two classes based on the BMP mRNAs that they expressed As atresia occurs BMP 7 mRNA is rapidly decreased to low or undetectable levels indicating that BMP 7 is a marker for healthy follicles Following ovulation BMP 7 mRNA was expressed in moderate amounts in groups of TLC of the newly formed CL I from E 1000 h to DI 1100 h Fig 5A 5B 5G however after the initiation of luteolysis at DII 1100 h BMP 7 mRNA becomes undetectable Thus BMP 7 transcripts are down regulated in both the luteolytic CL and apoptotic follicles Expression of BMP 15 mRNA BMP 15 mRNA expression was strictly germ cell specific and was developmentally regulated during normal folliculogenesis over the estrous cycle Table 1 Fig 6A 6B BMP 15 mRNA was absent in oocytes of primordial follicles When the squamous GC start to become cuboidal a weak hybridization signal was detected in the oocyte Fig 6C indicating BMP 15 gene activation is closely correlated with recruitment Low levels of expression were seen throughout the growth of the primary follicle but began to increase when a second layer of GC was forming Fig 6D As follicle development proceeded the expression of BMP 15 mRNA increased dramatically and very high near maximal levels were seen after the third layer of GC had formed Fig 6E Expression was maintained at high levels from this stage through ovulation Fig 6F It is notable that the BMP 15 mRNA levels appeared to decrease during atresia Table 1 Fig 6G The stage in the cycle did not appear to affect the BMP 15 expression Expression of BMPR IA mRNA The BMPR IA mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in the adult rat ovary indicating a broad function in a variety of ovary cell types during the cycle Table 1 Fig 7A 7B The highest expression was in the oocytes GC theca and CL with the greatest concentrations appearing in developing oocytes Table 1 Constitutively low to moderate expression was seen in the vascular system SIC SE SC and TE Table 1 The potential importance of oocyte BMPR IA mRNA is illustrated by its continuous expression throughout the course of oogenesis as it occurs within the adult ovary A weak hybridization signal could be identified in primordial follicles Fig 7C In the early stages of primary follicle development the levels of BMPR IA mRNA in the oocyte increased and were maximal in late preantral follicles Fig 7D 7F During the development of the dominant follicle BMPR IA mRNA was abundantly expressed but the signal appeared weaker than in the secondary follicles Fig 7G 7H In atretic follicles BMPR IA mRNA was highly expressed Fig 7I 7J In the GC Fig 7C 7D 7G 7H the pattern of BMPR IA mRNA expression during folliculogenesis was similar to that found in developing oocytes In CL moderate amounts of BMPR IA mRNA were expressed as it underwent luteinization and luteolysis In the theca BMPR IA mRNA expression was not notable except for a stage specific increase among the early tertiary follicles at P 1000 h Fig 7E 7F Expression of BMPR IB mRNA The expression of BMPR IB mRNA was strong in oocytes GC CL and SC Table 1 Fig 8A 8B 8C There was also expression in the theca vascular and SIC tissues but at lower levels In blood vessels the BMPR IB mRNA was moderately expressed in the tunica adventitia of the ovarian arteries suggesting a role for the BMPs in the ovary arterial system Fig 8D In the theca some TIC and TE cells showed BMPR IB expression with the highest levels appearing in dominant follicles at proestrus Table 1 Fig 8A 8B 8H 8I As with BMPR IA the message for BMPR IB was clearly visible in oocytes of primordial and primary follicles Fig 8E At the primary secondary follicle transition a sharp increase in oocyte BMPR IB mRNA expression occurred Fig 8G High expression was observed in all dominant follicles In the GC there were also clear follicle stage specific shifts in BMPR IB mRNA expression BMPR IB mRNA was first detected in some cuboidal GC of newly recruited primary follicles Fig 8E 8F The formation of a second layer of GC at the primary secondary follicle transition was marked by a sharp increase in BMPR IB mRNA expression in all the GC Fig 8G The entire mass of GC in developing dominant follicles strongly expressed BMPR IB mRNA Fig 8A 8B 8H 8I Cells in atretic follicles GC and oocyte continued to show high expression of BMPR IB mRNA Fig 8J 8K There was a marked decrease in BMPR IB mRNA following ovulation whereby little or no expression was evident in the CL I during the luteinization i e E 0200 h to DI 1100 h Table 1 However when luteolysis was initiated at DII 1100 h the BMPR IB mRNA is expressed in the TE Fig 8L 8M Then at P 2000 h there was strong BMPR IB expression in both the TE and in groups of endothelial cells scattered throughout the luteolytic CL I Fig 8N 8O Expression of BMPR II mRNA Over the cycle the GC expressed the highest levels of BMPR II mRNA with the CL SC and the vascular endothelium showing low variable levels of expression Table 1 Fig 9A 9B Although the oocytes of most follicles showed no hybridization signal above background a weak expression was consistently seen in some oocytes of primary and early secondary follicles Table 1 Fig 9C There was no detectable BMPR II mRNA expression in GC of the primordial follicles however a low expression was detected in primary follicles after recruitment Fig 9C During preantral follicle growth expression increased reaching high maximal levels in the GC of secondary follicles Fig 9A 9B High expression was seen in all the GC of the dominant follicle except at ovulation when there appeared to be a decrease in BMPR II mRNA within the cumulus GC Fig 9D 9E Ovulation was accompanied by a rapid decrease in the levels of BMPR II mRNA During the life of the CL low to moderate expression was seen in the lutein but not the endothelial cells Fig 9H BMPR II mRNA was strongly expressed in all GC during atresia Fig 9F 9G Expression of FS mRNA The message for the BMP antagonist FS was highly expressed during the estrous cycle being present in the GC CL and SIC Table 1 Fig 10A 10B It is notable that a striking change in FS mRNA expression occurred in the SIC during the preovulatory period In all the SIC FS mRNA was absent during most of the cycle but at P 2000 h it was very strongly expressed Fig 10C 10D 10E This observation suggests a burst of FS gene activity that may be associated with the preovulatory surge of LH during proestrus Folliculogenesis and luteogenesis were accompanied by striking changes in FS expression some of which were cycle dependent During the preantral stages of folliculogenesis FS mRNA was poorly expressed in the GC By comparison FS mRNA was highly expressed in all the GC of the dominant follicles over the cycle Table 1 Fig 10A 10B Then during atresia FS mRNA was low or absent in the GC Table 1 Thus FS gene activity and follicle dominance appear to be physiologically coupled After ovulation the CL showed high levels of FS mRNA expression during luteinization at E 0200 h and E 1000 h and moderate levels at DI 1100 h Fig 10F 10G 10H 10I 10J 10K The high expression of FS mRNA correlates with a high expression of progesterone by the new CL I Interestingly FS mRNA fell to non detectable levels in the CL I when luteolysis occurred at DII 1100 h Fig 10L 10M FS mRNA remained undetectable in the CL until P 2000 h when high expression was induced in a subset of lutein cells Fig 10N 10O This high expression in the luteolytic CL I persisted through estrous of the next cycle Discussion To better understand the physiological role of the BMP family in ovarian function the spatiotemporal expression patterns of a number of relevant BMP ligands receptors and a binding protein were determined by in situ hybridization in rat ovaries over the estrous cycle The general principle to emerge from our data is that the developmental programs of folliculogenesis recruitment selection and atresia ovulation and luteogenesis luteinization and luteolysis are accompanied by precise cell specific changes in the expression of the genes encoding the BMP family Therefore we hypothesize the regulated expression of BMP gene activity forms a part of the controlling network that ensures the proper timing of the developmental events that generates a normal estrous cycle The finding that the genes encoding the three types of BMP receptors are expressed in primordial follicles indicates that these fundamental reproductive units are targets for the BMPs In this regard we have shown recently that BMP 7 can promote primordial follicle growth 13 Thus it is reasonable to propose that one function of the BMP receptors in the primordial follicle might be to mediate the activation of recruitment by endogenous BMP 7 As there is no evidence that primordial follicles express BMP ligands the mechanism by which this activation occurs would be paracrine most likely involving BMP 7 from adjacent tissues such as the theca secondary interstitial or sex cords Unlike lower vertebrates the developing mammalian follicle is composed of more than one layer of GC One of the most important concepts generated in the ovary BMP field is that oocyte derived GDF 9 14 plays a role in the mechanisms governing the development of the second layer of GC i e the primary secondary follicle transition The question of how GDF 9 controls this step has yet to be answered Our data show that the primary secondary transition stage is accompanied by some rather dramatic changes in BMP expression including increased expression of i BMP 6 BMP 15 and BMPR IB in the oocyte ii BMP 2 BMP 6 and BMPR IA IB and II in the GC and iii BMP 4 and BMP 7 in the theca Because folliculogenesis in the murine proceeds to the preovulatory stage in the absence of BMP 6 30 BMP 15 15 and BMPR IB 31 one can assume that the marked increases in these regulatory molecules are not essential for the development of a second layer of GC The question of whether the increased expression of BMPR II and BMP 2 4 and 7 contribute to this important developmental event remains to be answered One interesting implication of our BMP 2 data is that the GC have already attained different states of differentiation by the early stages of secondary follicle development Based on previous work 32 33 it is not unreasonable to propose that oocyte morphogens may have control over GC fate beginning as early as the primary secondary follicle transition It will be interesting to investigate how this phenomenon fits into the mechanisms underlying the primary secondary follicle transition Our results demonstrate for the first time that the theca interna of healthy follicles is composed of two distinct populations of theca interstitial cells TIC One group which expresses BMP 4 is present as an outer layer of cells juxtaposed to the theca externa TE and another which expresses BMP 7 is present at the proximal side of the theca interna near the basal lamina of the follicle These differences can be found throughout folliculogenesis beginning during the secondary stage This together with the failure to detect BMP 4 and 7 in the theca of atretic follicles supports the idea that the cellular sites and coordinate expression of these BMP genes may have important regulatory roles in maintaining folliculogenesis In this regard a recent study has demonstrated the ability of BMP 4 to inhibit cyclic AMP stimulated androgen production by the cultured human theca cell line presumably by activating BMP receptors BMPR IA IB and II which are expressed in these cells 34 Because theca derived androgen is required for follicle estrogen biosynthesis and has been implicated in ovary pathology 35 it will be interesting to determine how the expression and functions of these TIC specific BMPs are integrated into the overall processes of physiology and pathophysiology Besides the TI a high level of BMP expression BMP 3b and 4 is found within the smooth muscle cells of the TE during the process of follicle formation Very little is known about the role of the TE in folliculogenesis however this new finding raises the possibility that BMP 3b and 4 could have autocrine actions on TE histogenesis and or paracrine actions on theca follicle morphogenesis The rapid cessation of mitosis and the expression of apoptosis in the GC is the sinequanone of follicle atresia Our results suggest a possible role for BMPs in follicle atresia The supporting data are as follow First a striking feature of atresia in the rat ovary is the cessation of BMP expression BMP 3b 4 and 7 within the theca compartment This observation is particularly interesting with respect to BMP 7 In previous work we demonstrated that BMP 7 could stimulate DNA synthesis in rat GC 13 as it does in human osteoblasts 36 Equally relevant several reports have demonstrated the role for BMP 7 in preventing apoptosis in other cell systems 37 38 Together these data suggest that theca derived BMP 7 might be a follicle survival factor through its ability to enhance GC proliferation and suppress apoptosis Second atresia is accompanied by a relatively high level of expression of BMP 2 and 6 and the BMPR IA IB and II Significantly this occurred in the absence of the BMP antagonist FS Thus it is possible that GC BMP receptor signaling pathways are under maximal stimulation by BMP 2 and 6 during atresia How this phenomenon contributes to atresia is unknown but our finding 12 that BMP 6 inhibits FSH signaling is relevant because there is compelling evidence that continuous FSH stimulation is essential for follicle survival The expression of the family of BMPs ligands receptors and a binding protein in the fundamental cell types of the dominant follicles DF argues for a physiological role of an intrinsic BMP in directing growth and cell fates in the DF This is supported by two main lines of evidence First we found that the genes encoding the BMP receptors BMPR IA IB II are highly expressed in the DF throughout its course of development And second the BMP ligands BMP 4 6 7 and 15 act on the GC to control the level of mitosis and FSH receptor signaling 1 In this regard one particularly interesting observation is the dramatic loss of BMP 6 mRNA in the GC when the DF is selected at E 0200 h Because BMP 6 can prevent FSH action 12 the rapid loss of BMP 6 expression may be required for FSH to exert its crucial functions during DF development The secondary rise of FSH on estrous morning is obligatory for DF selection and we have preliminary data showing that FSH induces the loss of BMP 6 mRNA in GC Thus the secondary rise of FSH may down regulate BMP 6 expression in the DF It is notable that the absence of GC BMP 6 is a marker for the DF Finally with regard to FSH action FS has been shown to neutralize the bioactivity of the FSH inhibitor BMP 15 39 It is possible therefore that the strong expression of FS by the DF may serve to modulate BMP 15 action such that sufficient FSH receptors are expressed in the GC to permit the development of a preovulatory follicle A role for the BMPs in regulating luteogenesis is strongly suggested our data Some key findings are as follows First the classical view of CL development is that luteinization is inhibited by oocyte derived luteinization inhibitors 32 40 41 two of which have been identified as BMP 6 and 15 8 12 Therefore the loss of oocyte BMP 6 and 15 at ovulation undoubtedly plays an especially prominent role in activating luteinization Second the fact that CL BMP 2 expression is suppressed and activated during luteinization and luteolysis respectively suggests that BMP 2 might be a novel luteinization inhibitor Further work is necessary to investigate this possibility Third FS is strongly expressed during luteinization but is undetectable at luteolysis Thus it is conceivable that the cycle specific expression of FS within the CL may control the level of progesterone production through anti BMP mechanisms And fourth a role of BMPR IB in luteogenesis was suggested by our finding that luteinization and luteolysis respectively are characterized by the absence and presence of BMPR IB expression in the CL A functional link between the expression of BMPR IB and luteolysis comes from loss of function studies showing that the CL of the cycle continues to secrete progesterone in the absence of BMPR IB 31 This work together with our finding that BMPR IB is selectively expressed in the TE of the CL at luteolysis supports the novel hypothesis that the regulation of inducible and TE specific BMPR IB gene expression may control luteolysis The observation that the ovarian sex cords SC express an intrinsic BMP system replete with ligands BMP 3b 4 7 and receptors BMPR IA IB II is novel The SC are vestiges of the cranial portion of the mesonephric tubules and ducts and in the adult ovary appear as a cluster of blind tubules in the hilar region Although little is known about the physiology and biology of ovarian SC they have been linked to the genesis of ovary cancer through distinct TGF signaling pathways 42 43 Significantly the importance of FS in the genesis of this cancer has been established 44 Given the evidence that BMPs are potent growth factors and that FS can modulate their bioactivity it will be interesting to investigate the possibility that this intrinsic BMP system may be involved to pathogenesis of SC tumors Because SC were occasionally found juxtaposed to developing follicles blood vessels and secondary interstitial cells one cannot exclude the possibility that the SC derived BMPs may have paracrine functions A functional role for the BMPs in the ovary surface epithelium OSE is suggested by the strong expression of BMP 3b 4 and 6 Based on our data BMP 3b and 6 appear to be constitutively expressed throughout the epithelium over the cycle a finding consistent with a maintenance type role for these OSE BMPs An interesting finding is the cell specific induction of BMP 4 gene expression in a subset of epithelial cells covering the ovulated follicle and the newly formed CL I Although the function of this inducible and cell specific gene expression is unclear it is tightly correlated with the replenishment of the surface epithelium that is exfoliated from the surface of ovulating follicle Thus the importance of this highly specific expression of BMP 4 may relate to the regeneration of the OSE during postovulatory repair Although BMP 4 expression appears tightly regulated over the cycle it remains to be determined how the regulation is controlled Because the OSE does not appear to express BMP receptors the OSE derived BMP 4 probably acts as a paracrine growth factor in the underlying stroma It is noteworthy that epidemiological studies have shown that the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer is decreased by factors that suppress ovulation i e pregnancy breast feeding and oral contraceptive pill 45 46 Given the relationship between LH dependent ovulation and the induction of BMP 4 expression it will be important to explore a possible link between the risk of ovary cancer and the ovulation inducible and OSE cell specific BMP 4 gene expression It is clear from this work that the regulation of inducible and cell specific expression of the BMP family is a general property of the mammalian ovary Consequently the potential for independent and coordinated contributions of different BMPs to control growth differentiation and apoptosis is widely distributed throughout all the histological units of the ovary The current challenges are to understand how specific hormone growth factor interactions regulate BMP expression in the fundamental ovary cell types and how these interactions are integrated into the morphological and histological events that generate the estrous cycle The clinical relevance is emphasized by our previous finding that the expression of GDF 9 is dysregulated in oocytes of women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome 47
