 Background The biliary system is more than a passive conduit transporting bile from the liver to the intestines Hepatic bile is actively modified by the epithelial cells that line the bile ducts and gallbladder Biliary epithelial function is partially under the control of secretin and vasoactive intestinal peptide 1 Other extracellular agonists that influence biliary function include neuropeptides 2 3 ATP 4 5 and bile salts 6 In addition to the well documented role that cytokines play in the immune response and inflammation 7 8 cytokines also modify the functioning of epithelial cells For instance tumor necrosis factor TNF can modify intracellular signal transduction and regulate ionic channel activities in various epithelial cells 9 A few studies have shown that cytokines can alter biliary epithelial cell function 10 11 Biliary epithelial cells are capable of producing a great variety of physiologically active compounds For example it has been shown that biliary epithelial cells synthesize nitric oxide a strong vasodilator 12 and endothelin 1 13 a potent vasoconstrictor Various cytokines are also produced by biliary epithelial cells 14 As biliary epithelial cells are capable of both producing and responding to cytokines these cells may use cytokines for the autocrine paracrine regulation of their own function as well as that of other cells Bile in the biliary ducts and the gallbladder often contains bacteria and the bacterial product lipopolysaccharide LPS This may be due to ascending infection from the intestine or descending infection via portal venous blood 15 16 Bacterial infection usually leads to activation of the immune system followed by inflammation While inflammation is an important element in the defense against infection it can also contribute to cholestatic biliary diseases and cholelithiasis Therefore the control of the immune and inflammatory response of biliary tissue to bacteria is important in determining disease progression While the biliary epithelium can act as a physical barrier to limit bacterial infection of the underlying tissue 16 its physiological response to bacteria and bacterial products is not well characterized Like pulmonary and intestinal epithelial cells biliary epithelial cells might respond to bacteria in bile by producing cytokines and other factors To test this hypothesis we used cultured normal mouse gallbladder epithelial cells MGBE as an in vitro model system to examine the ability of gallbladder epithelium to produce mRNA for various cytokines and chemokines The synthesis and secretion of TNF protein was also measured These cells demonstrated distinct changes in their cytokine and chemokine mRNA expression profile and TNF protein production in response to LPS Methods Materials Analytical grade chemicals and tissue culture supplies were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co St Louis MO except where noted Vitrogen bovine dermal collagen was purchased from Collagen Corp Palo Alto CA Transwell inserts 24 mm diameter 3 m pore size were purchased from Corning Corp Acton MA Cell culture MGBE were grown as previously described 17 In brief MGBE were grown on Vitrogen coated Transwell inserts suspended above human gallbladder myo fibroblast feeder cells The cells were fed with Eagle s minimum essential medium containing 10 fetal bovine serum 2 mM L glutamine 20 mM HEPES 100 IU mL penicillin 100 g mL streptomycin plus Insulin Transferrin Sodium Selenite Media Supplement MEM vitamins and MEM non essential amino acid solution Sigma Chemical Co Confluent MGBE have well differentiated morphology and high transepithelial electrical resistance 163 cm 2 17 Prior to each experiment Transwell inserts with confluent MGBE were transferred to new plates without feeder cells RT PCR assay of cytokine and chemokine mRNA Confluent MGBE were fed serum free medium Cells were treated with LPS from E coli serotype 0111 B4 or Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 10 at 100 g mL added to the apical compartment of the insert After two hours the cells were harvested by trypsinization and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent Gibco BRL Gaithersburg MD Five g of total RNA was reverse transcribed according to the manufacturer s protocol Superscript II Preamplification System Gibco BRL using oligo dT as primer cDNA prepared from 0 5 g RNA was subjected to PCR using murine gene specific primers for 8 different cytokines and chemokines Table 1 as previously detailed 18 All of the primer pairs spanned at least one intron in the corresponding genomic DNA Positive RNA controls were performed previously to confirm specificity of primer pairs data not shown Negative controls were performed by omitting the RT step or the cDNA template from PCR amplification For qualitative PCR target sequences were amplified at 56 C for 25 cycles for semi quantitative PCR target sequences for TNF IL 1 and MIP 2 CXCL2 were amplified at 56 C between 22 and 32 cycles in order to yield visible products within the linear amplification range PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 2 agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide All RT PCR bands at the expected size were also directly sequenced to confirm their identity Glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH or acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein ARP were used as internal controls TNF Immunoassay Confluent MGBE were fed serum free medium with or without LPS added to the apical side LPS concentration 2 or 100 g mL Medium from the apical and basolateral compartment was collected separately at measured intervals and immediately frozen at 70 C The cells were lysed with 1 NP 40 buffer 150 mM NaCl 50 mM Tris pH 8 0 containing 100 g mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 g mL aprotinin sonicated for 30 seconds then frozen TNF was measured in cell lysate and undiluted medium using the Mouse TNF Immunoassay Kit from R D Systems Minneapolis MN Statistical analysis on the TNF immunoassay data was performed using Student s t test Cell viability was assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release into the medium as previously described 6 Changes in transepithelial permeability was measured using 3H mannitol as a small molecular weight probe Tritiated mannitol 2 Ci with cold mannitol 0 15 mM was added to the apical medium and samples of the basolateral medium harvested and counted at 1 2 4 and 24 hours after LPS treatment Results RT PCR Using cytokine chemokine specific primers with RT PCR untreated MGBE showed distinct bands representing mRNA of TNF RANTES Regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted CCL5 and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 MIP 2 CXCL2 Figure 1 Upon apical treatment with LPS from E coli for two hours these cells additionally produced mRNA for interleukin 1 IL 1 IL 6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 MCP 1 CCL2 There was no detectable expression of IL 10 or KC murine GRO CXCL1 mRNA before or after LPS treatment Semi quantitative RT PCR using specific primers for TNF MIP 2 CXCL2 and IL 1 showed that LPS treatment caused the amount of TNF mRNA to slightly increase compared to the already abundant levels found in untreated cells figure 2and 3 In contrast there was a substantial increase in the expression of MIP 2 CXCL2 mRNA and IL 1 mRNA following LPS treatment compared to control Similar responses were seen when the cells were treated with LPS from P aeruginosa Figure 2and 3 All visualized PCR product bands were of the expected size and nucleotide sequence confirming proper identification Although the RANTES CCL5 sample had extra bands of unknown origin the band at the expected size of 205 bp had a nucleotide sequence that matched RANTES TNF Immunoassay The immunoassay experiments showed no detectable TNF in untreated MGBE or their surrounding media after 5 hours of incubation limit of detection 5 1 pg mL In contrast following treatment with 100 g mL E coli LPS the concentration of TNF protein in the cells was 33 6 pg per 10 6cells in one hour Figure 4 Intracellular TNF concentration reached a peak two hours after LPS treatment with a subsequent decrease by five hours After two and five hours of LPS treatment there was measurable release of TNF into the media of both the apical and basolateral compartments figure 5 Three different species of LPS E coli P aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae stimulated TNF release in a similar fashion figure 6 Treatment with 2 g mL E coli LPS showed comparable results None of the treatments increased lactate dehydrogenase in the medium compared with controls showing that the LPS treatments did not alter epithelial cell integrity data not shown LPS treatment also had no effect on the transepithelial permeability of these cells for up to 24 hours as measured by 3H mannitol diffusion experiments when compared to controls data not shown Discussion Bacteria are found in the bile of the gallbladder and bile ducts 15 16 the presence of which may have relevance to clinical diseases such as stone formation 19 20 21 primary sclerosing cholangitis 22 and cholestasis 23 24 Direct exposure of sub epithelial tissue to LPS from gram negative bacteria causes release of cytokines by resident leukocytes and activation of macrophages 25 The biliary fluid of patients with cholangitis has increased concentrations of the inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL 6 suggesting that bacterial infection leads to an increase in cytokines released into the bile 26 Adding LPS to the bile of guinea pig gallbladders in vivo led to increased IL 1 concentration in the bile 27 What role biliary epithelial cells play in the response to bacteria in bile is not known While most cytokine research has focused on cells of the immune system other cell types produce cytokines including the epithelial cells of the lung 28 29 retina 30 and intestines 31 32 Among the few studies involving the biliary system it was demonstrated that cultured human intrahepatic duct epithelial cells produce functional IL 8 and MCP 1 CCL2 14 33 Isolated human intrahepatic epithelial ducts expressed immunoreactive IL 6 when treated with IL 1 or phorbal myristate acetate 34 Intracellular TNF mRNA and protein was detected in intrahepatic biliary duct cells in tissue sections 35 but not in cultured intrahepatic epithelial cells therefore there was no clear demonstration that biliary epithelium secretes TNF Little research has focused on the ability of the epithelial cells of the extrahepatic biliary system to produce cytokines or chemokines As described in this paper MGBE were used as an in vitro model system of gallbladder epithelium to measure the endogenous production of cytokines and chemokines by extrahepatic biliary epithelial cells These cultured cells consist exclusively of normal non neoplastic epithelial cells 17 without other cell types such as leukocytes ordinarily found in biliary tissues The experiments showed that unstimulated MGBE express mRNA for TNF MIP 2 and RANTES CCL5 After treating the apical surface of the cells with LPS the mRNA levels for TNF and MIP 2 CXCL2 increased while mRNA for IL 1 IL 6 and MCP 1 CCL2 appeared for the first time Therefore cytokines TNF IL 1 and IL 6 a C C type chemokine MCP 1 CCL2 and a C X C type chemokine MIP 2 CXCL2 are all up regulated at the RNA level by bacterial product interaction with the epithelial cells The effects of LPS treatment for two hours on cytokine and chemokine mRNA expression clearly suggests that biliary epithelial cells can modify their own cytokine and chemokine production after bacterial challenge at the mRNA level As with all in vitro cell systems there is the possibility that the cells in culture may have phenotypic changes to their cytokine profile compared to in vivo cells In other parameters tested i e morphology mucin secretion etc these cells retain the normal phenotype of cells in vivo Measurements of TNF protein showed that MGBE synthesize and secrete TNF when exposed to LPS while untreated cells do not This demonstrates that gallbladder epithelial cells themselves secrete a cytokine in response to bacterial products The results from RT PCR showing a relatively high TNF mRNA expression levels in untreated cells which is only slightly increased by LPS treatment along with the immunoassay results suggest that TNF mRNA is constantly present in these cells but is not translated into protein until certain triggers are provided This is consistent with the post transcriptional regulation of TNF observed in other cells 36 In contrast the mRNA of other factors such as IL 1 IL 6 and MCP 1 CCL2 are not synthesized until the cells are stimulated suggesting that their production is under transcriptional control The protein expression of these other cytokines and chemokines along with the precise nature of the interaction between LPS and cell surface receptors warrants further study While the exact role that gallbladder epithelial cells play in inflammatory and infectious diseases has yet to be determined our research supports the hypothesis that gallbladder epithelium have some innate cytokine producing capabilities in response to the presence of bacteria on their apical surface The accumulation of TNF in the gallbladder bile of patients with cholangitis may be due in part to the apical release of TNF by biliary epithelial cells In contrast basolateral secretion of TNF could lead to a focal accumulation of TNF in the sub mucosa of biliary tissue Sufficient cytokine secretion could then stimulate the leukocytes in the sub epithelial tissue leading to inflammation of the tissue without the need for the bacteria to pass through the epithelial barrier The production of cytokines by gallbladder epithelial cells following LPS exposure demonstrates that biliary epithelial cells may be an active partner with the immune system in the detection of and defense against bacteria in bile During sepsis biliary epithelial cells could mediate biliary secretory function through cytokine and chemokine production Dog gallbladder epithelial cells demonstrated increased mucin secretion following TNF treatment 10 In addition exogenous TNF altered the absorptive properties of cultured human gallbladder epithelial cells 37 It is therefore reasonable to suggest that TNF produced by gallbladder epithelial cells in response to LPS could affect cellular function in an autocrine manner Since mucin secretion and gallbladder transport properties play vital roles in cholelithiasis changes in these parameters caused by endogenous cytokines and chemokines may promote stone formation Epithelial derived cytokines and chemokines also may alter biliary function leading to cholestasis Conclusions Gallbladder epithelial cells demonstrated distinct patterns of expression of mRNA for various cytokines and chemokines and responded to treatment with LPS by altering their expression of certain cytokine and chemokine RNA and increasing TNF protein synthesis and secretion The ability of biliary epithelial cell to control endogenous cytokine and chemokine production has important implications for biliary inflammation and diseases such as cholangitis cholestasis and cholelithiasis Competing interests None declared Authors
