                so what do you think about the uh income taxes   well i could do with a lot less than that   where do you live   i live in Dallas   okay i live in Dallas too   oh good well i live in Plano in that case   okay i live in uh in the Village do you know where that is i   oh yeah i do yeah   yeah well one thing i can tell you i hate about the taxes in Dallas is the eight and a quarter percent sales tax   yes   it i think its like the highest in the US because my sister lived in New York and it was only seven percent there   uhhuh   Washington DC was only six percent and where i moved from Virginia was only four and a half percent and i can tell you we were upset when it went to four and a half   i know   it was only four percent   and you know we had no sales tax here about oh i dont know maybe ten years ago we had none at all and thats how it started with uh four percent five percent   really umhum umhum   and all of a sudden here we are now       and its horrible   what since theres no uh state tax i assume that thats why it went up fast because Virginia does have a state tax   well its true but they did without it all those years   umhum hm   and they keep talking about the state tax and theyll probably put one in and theyll have this too so   yeah it if they put state tax in i mean ill be pretty upset   yeah   because i mean part of the reason part of the incentives of moving to Texas from Virginia was the fact that you have no state tax and basically it adds about sixty dollars to your paycheck   uhhuh   uh every two weeks and uh  if that comes back in   yeah   ill be pretty mad because sixty dollars a paycheck is a lot of money actually you know   yeah   so uh i dont know im not very much for a for state tax   well i hope it doesnt but you know how it goes so     yeah they keep talking about uh you know the light rail system adding taxes   uhhuh   and then uh there was another issue that came up i forget uh the horse racing   yeah   theyre putting up the the racing fees they said they may raise taxes because of that yeah they said uh to build okay   raise them   apparently they said the builders would provide thirty million dollars in funds and the state would need to provide sixty five million dollars in funds   oh   well in order to get the sixty five million dollars it would cause an increase in taxes but it seems like it would pay itself off   oh well it will   so you know  whats the purpose of the increasing the sales tax you know   probably the first season   yeah so you know   but theyre funny about things like that here   yeah things like that you know   they really are when i came here you couldnt buy beer couldnt buy a drink  nothing was open on Sunday not even a grocery store i mean nothing nothing you know   umhum   no huh   so it was a lot worse and as more people come in it does get better but they still have some real funny laws   umhum i mean you know federal tax i mean everybody has to pay standard around the US and that doesnt bother me that much you know the you buy a house you cut your taxes a little bit the rest of it you pay what you owe   yeah yeah   but uh  like sales tax and i where i lived in uh in Virginia they had personal property tax in the counties   uhhuh   and that was a lot my parents paid almost four thousand dollars a year in personal property tax on the house they paid almost a thousand dollars on uh   oh that is   on two of our cars and they paid like a couple hundred dollars on the other cars but the personal property tax itself used to add up   oh   you know just i mean itself would probably add up to seven or eight thousand dollars a year   hm yeah   and thats a lot of money you know most places go ahead and just you know put it into your mortgage payment so you dont forget about it at the last minute you know and have to come up with the funds at the end of the year   that is yeah hm   but that gets real expensive   oh yeah that is   do they have that kind of tax down here on the houses at all do you know   uh uh they well they do a little bit but um its its like next to nothing ive seen it its on my when you pay your registration and stuff like that there is a little place   um umhum well you know like every year they renew the registration here kind of like fifty or sixty bucks   uhhuh it costs what   so its only like fifty or sixty bucks to renew your registration here but in Virginia they wont renew your registration till you pay your property personal property tax   yeah yeah uhhuh   and i had a i  i paid you know twelve hundred dollars a year for my last car   really   for personal property tax alone so that was kind of a relief i guess   God   thats not too bad but other than that everything worked out   yeah so you havent been here very long   whats that   you havent been here very long   ive been here about two years now   two years   but uh in the two years ive ive been here ive been through ive had two cars   umhum   so ive never really like you know i dont know if they if they ever will assess a personal uh any kind of tax   uh yeah   on the car other than what i paid when i registered uh registered the car   yeah   so thats the only thing i can really think of so so do you work for TI or you just doing this   no i dont im a nurse i work down at Presbyterian   okay yeah someone just mentioned this program to me so i thought itd be kind of cool   yeah oh it is you know theyre supposed to cut you off at ten calls at least thats what i heard that you could could get to do ten calls   oh do they really yeah i i dont know how the thing works uh   and this is like the seventeenth   oh really  all right you   yeah so its great
