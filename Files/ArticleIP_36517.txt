 The Round Up What happened old as the hills ancient as the ax the horse water in a clay cup dirt under the fingernails The river forgets the fish and the winter sun slides beyond the far hills All of them had mothers and all the mothers sang while swimming and as the women sang the birds left the trees which ringed the water for the clouds where the distance whispered a different dream than the dream dreaming this dark afternoon The men were boys not that long ago delicate confident paddling alongside their mothers through the hot afternoons The water dark green with splash and shout summer just a whistle and gone Of course the night will still hold stars the moon s journey the planet s orbit There will always be nests branches the swaying and the saying They have names and are men exactly like you lined up in jackets boots and caps cold with the waiting It is unbelievable even some of the soldiers begin to sob Trucked out to no where are doctors lawyers plumbers builders bankers It is winter snow rides the collapse of clouds There are just shades of brown and grey a line of trees a dark scribble like markings done by a child As each man is shot whether he drops backward or to the side he forgets us his own name this place civilization like the kiss in the evening at the lit threshold whose intent was to swear return
