 Upon arrival from Europe now more than two decades ago I was taken aback by the level of violence in the American media I do not just mean the daily news even though it is hard getting used to multiple murders per day in any large city No I mean sitcoms comedies drama series and movies Staying away from Schwarzenegger and Stallone does not do it almost any American movie features violence Inevitably desensitization sets in If you say for example that Dances with Wolves the 1990 movie with Kevin Costner is violent people look at you as if you are crazy They see an idyllic sentimental movie with beautiful landscapes showing a rare white man who respects American Indians The bloody scenes barely register Comedy is no different I love for example Saturday Night Live for its inside commentary on peculiarly American phenomena such as cheerleaders televangelists and celebrity lawyers But SNL is incomplete without at least one sketch in which someone s car explodes or head gets blown off Characters such as Hans and Franz We re going to pump you up appeal to me for their names alone and yes I do have a brother named Hans but when their free weights are so heavy that their arms get torn off I am baffled The spouting blood gets a big laugh from the audience but I fail to see the humor Did I grow up in a land of sissies Perhaps but I am not mentioning this to decide whether violence in the media and our ability to grow immune to it as I also have over the years is desirable or not I simply wish to draw attention to the cultural fissures in how violence is portrayed how we teach conflict resolution and whether harmony is valued over competitiveness This is the problem with the human species Somewhere in all of this resides a human nature but it is molded and stretched into so many different directions that it is hard to say if we are naturally competitive or naturally community builders In fact we are both but each society reaches its own balance between the two In America the squeaky wheel gets the grease In Japan the nail that stands out gets pounded into the ground Does this variability mean as some have argued that animal studies cannot possibly shed light on human aggression Nature red in tooth and claw remains the dominant image of the animal world Animals just fight and that is it It is not that simple First each species has its own way of handling conflict with for example the chimpanzee Pan troglodytes being far more violent than that equally close relative of ours the bonobo P paniscus de Waal 1997 But also within each species we find just as in humans variation from group to group There are cultures of violence and cultures of peace The latter are made possible by the universal primate ability to settle disputes and iron out differences There was a time when no review of human nature would be complete without assertions about our inborn aggressiveness The first scientist to bring up this issue not coincidentally after World War II was Konrad Lorenz 1966 Lorenz s thesis was greeted with accusations about attempts to whitewash human atrocities all the more so given the Nobel Prize winner s native tongue which was German But Lorenz was hardly alone In the USA science journalist Robert Ardrey 1961 presented us as killer apes unlikely to ever get our nasty side under control Recent world events have done little to counter this pessimistic outlook The opposition argued of course that aggression like all human behavior is subject to powerful cultural influences They even signed petitions to this effect such as the controversial Seville Statement on Violence Adams et al 1990 In the polarized mind set of the time the issue was presented in either or fashion as if behavior cannot be both learned and built upon a biological foundation This rather fruitless nature nurture debate becomes considerably more complex if we include what is usually left out which is the ability to keep aggression under control and foster peace For this ability too there exist animal parallels such as the habit of chimpanzees to reconcile after fights by means of a kiss and embrace Such reunions are well documented in a multitude of animals including nonprimates such as hyenas and dolphins They serve to restore social relationships disturbed by aggression and any animal that depends on cooperation needs such mechanisms of social repair Aureli and de Waal 2000 de Waal 2000 There are even indications that in animals too cultural influences matter in this regard This may disturb those who write culture with a capital C and hence view it as uniquely human but it is a serious possibility nonetheless Nonhuman culture is currently one of the hottest areas in the study of animal behavior The idea goes back to the pioneering work of Kinji Imanishi who in 1952 proposed that if individuals learn from one another their behavior may over time grow different from that of individuals in other groups of the same species thus creating a characteristic culture reviewed by de Waal 2001 Imanishi thus brought the culture concept down to its most basic feature that is the social rather than genetic transmission of behavior Since then many examples have been documented mostly concerning subsistence techniques such as the sweet potato washing of Japanese macaques Macaca fuscata and the rich array of tool use by wild chimpanzees orangutans Pongo pymaeus and capuchin monkeys Cebus spp Whiten et al 1999 de Waal 2001 Hirata et al 2001 Perry et al 2003 van Schaik et al 2003 However much less attention has been paid to social culture which we might define as the transmission of social positions preferences habits and attitudes Social culture is obviously harder to document than tool use In human culture for instance it is easy to tell if people eat with knife and fork or with chopsticks but to notice if a culture is egalitarian or hierarchical warm or distant collectivistic or individualistic takes time and is difficult to capture in behavioral measures A well documented monkey example of social culture is the inheritance of rank positions in macaque and baboon societies The future position in the hierarchy of a newborn female can be predicted with almost one hundred percent certainty on the basis of her mother s rank Females with relatives in high places are born with a silver spoon in their mouth so to speak whereas those of lowly origin will spend their life at the bottom Despite its stability the system depends on learning Early in life the young monkey finds out against which opponents it can expect help from her mother and sisters When sparring with peer A she may utter screams that recruit massive support to defeat A But against peer B she can scream her lungs out and nothing happens Consequently she will come to dominate A but not B Experiments manipulating the presence of family members have found that when support dwindles dominant females are unable to maintain their positions Chapais 1988 In other words the kin based hierarchy is maintained for generation after generation through social rather than genetic transmission Returning to the issue of aggressive behavior here the effects of social culture can be felt as well Without any drugs or brain lesions one experiment managed to turn monkeys into pacifists Juveniles of two different macaque species were placed together day and night for five months Rhesus monkeys Macaca mulatta known as quarrelsome and violent were housed with the more tolerant and easy going stumptail monkeys M arctoides Figure 1 Stumptail monkeys easily reconcile with their opponents after fights by holding each others hips the so called hold bottom ritual whereas reconciliations are rare in rhesus monkeys Because the mixed species groups were dominated by the stumptails physical aggression was rare The atmosphere was relaxed and after a while all of the monkeys became friends Juveniles of the two species played together groomed together and slept in large mixed huddles Most importantly the rhesus monkeys developed peacemaking skills on a par with those of their more tolerant group mates Even when at the end of the experiment both species were separated the rhesus monkeys still showed three times more reconciliation and grooming behaviors after fights than typical of their kind de Waal and Johanowicz 1993 Primates thus can adopt social behavior under the influence of others which opens the door to social culture Not unlike rhesus monkeys baboons have a reputation for fierce competition and nasty fights With the study by Robert Sapolsky and Lisa Share published in this issue of PLoS Biology we now have the first field evidence that primates can go the flower power route Sapolsky and Share 2004 Wild baboons developed an exceptionally pacific social tradition that outlasted the individuals who established it For years Sapolsky has documented how olive baboons Papio anubis on the plains of the Masai Mara in Kenya wage wars of nerves compromising their rivals immune systems and pushing up the level of their blood cortisol Sapolsky 1994 An accident of history however selectively wiped out all the male bullies of his main study troop As a result the number of aggressive incidents dropped dramatically This by itself was not so surprising It became more interesting when it was discovered that the behavioral change was maintained for a decade Baboon males migrate after puberty hence fresh young males enter troops all the time resulting in a complete turn over of males during the intervening decade Nevertheless compared with troops around it the affected troop upheld its reduced aggression increased friendly behavior and exceptionally low stress levels The conclusion from this natural experiment is that like human societies each animal society has its own ecological and behavioral history which determines its prevalent social style It is somewhat ironic that at a time when researchers on human aggression are increasingly attracted albeit with a far more sophisticated approach to the Lorenzian idea of a biological basis of aggression Enserink 2000 students of animal behavior are beginning to look at its possible cultural basis There is no reason for animals with a development as slow as a baboon with adulthood achieved in five or six years not to be influenced in every way by the environment in which they grow up including the social environment How this influence takes place is a point of much debate and remains unclear in the case of the peaceful male baboons in the Masai Mara Given their mobility the males themselves are unlikely transmitters of social traditions within their natal troop Therefore Sapolsky and Share look at the females for an answer female baboons stay all their lives in the same troop By reacting positively to certain kinds of behavior for example females may be able to steer male attitudes in a new direction This complex problem is hard to unravel with a single study especially in the absence of experimentation Yet the main two points of this discovery are loud and clear social behavior observed in nature may be a product of culture and even the fiercest primates do not forever need to stay this way Let us hope this applies to humanity as well
