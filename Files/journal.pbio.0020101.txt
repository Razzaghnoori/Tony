                            Upon arrival from Europe now more than two decades ago I was taken aback by the level        of violence in the American media I do not just mean the daily news even though it is        hard getting used to multiple murders per day in any large city No I mean sitcoms        comedies drama series and movies Staying away from Schwarzenegger and Stallone does not        do it almost any American movie features violence Inevitably desensitization sets in If        you say for example that         Dances with Wolves the  movie with Kevin Costner is violent people        look at you as if you are crazy They see an idyllic sentimental movie with beautiful        landscapes showing a rare white man who respects American Indians The bloody scenes        barely register        Comedy is no different I love for example         Saturday Night Live for its inside commentary on peculiarly American        phenomena such as cheerleaders televangelists and celebrity lawyers But         SNL is incomplete without at least one sketch in which someones car        explodes or head gets blown off Characters such as Hans and Franz Were going to pump        you up appeal to me for their names alone and yes I do have a brother named Hans but        when their free weights are so heavy that their arms get torn off I am baffled The        spouting blood gets a big laugh from the audience but I fail to see the humor        Did I grow up in a land of sissies Perhaps but I am not mentioning this to decide        whether violence in the media and our ability to grow immune to itas I also have over the        yearsis desirable or not I simply wish to draw attention to the cultural fissures in how        violence is portrayed how we teach conflict resolution and whether harmony is valued over        competitiveness This is the problem with the human species Somewhere in all of this        resides a human nature but it is molded and stretched into so many different directions        that it is hard to say if we are naturally competitive or naturally communitybuilders In        fact we are both but each society reaches its own balance between the two In America        the squeaky wheel gets the grease In Japan the nail that stands out gets pounded into the        ground        Does this variability mean as some have argued that animal studies cannot possibly        shed light on human aggression Nature red in tooth and claw remains the dominant image        of the animal world Animals just fight and that is it It is not that simple First each        species has its own way of handling conflict with for example the chimpanzee         Pan troglodytes  being far more violent than that equally close        relative of ours the bonobo         P paniscus  de Waal  But also within each species we        find just as in humans variation from group to group There are cultures of violence        and cultures of peace The latter are made possible by the universal primate ability to        settle disputes and iron out differences        There was a time when no review of human nature would be complete without assertions        about our inborn aggressiveness The first scientist to bring up this issue not        coincidentally after World War II was Konrad Lorenz  Lorenzs thesis was greeted        with accusations about attempts to whitewash human atrocities all the more so given the        Nobel Prize winners native tongue which was German But Lorenz was hardly alone In the        USA science journalist Robert Ardrey  presented us as killer apes unlikely to ever        get our nasty side under control Recent world events have done little to counter this        pessimistic outlook        The opposition argued of course that aggression like all human behavior is subject        to powerful cultural influences They even signed petitions to this effect such as the        controversial         Seville Statement on Violence Adams et al  In the polarized        mindset of the time the issue was presented in eitheror fashion as if behavior cannot        be both learned and built upon a biological foundation This rather fruitless        naturenurture debate becomes considerably more complex if we include what is usually left        out which is the ability to keep aggression under control and foster peace For this        ability too there exist animal parallels such as the habit of chimpanzees to reconcile        after fights by means of a kiss and embrace Such reunions are welldocumented in a        multitude of animals including nonprimates such as hyenas and dolphins They serve to        restore social relationships disturbed by aggression and any animal that depends on        cooperation needs such mechanisms of social repair Aureli and de Waal  de Waal         There are even indications that in animals too cultural influences matter in this regard        This may disturb those who write culture with a capital         C  and hence view it as uniquely human but it is a serious possibility        nonetheless        Nonhuman culture is currently one of the hottest areas in the study of animal behavior        The idea goes back to the pioneering work of Kinji Imanishi who in  proposed that if        individuals learn from one another their behavior may over time grow different from that        of individuals in other groups of the same species thus creating a characteristic culture        reviewed by de Waal  Imanishi thus brought the culture concept down to its most        basic feature that is the social rather than genetic transmission of behavior Since        then many examples have been documented mostly concerning subsistence techniques such as        the sweet potato washing of Japanese macaques         Macaca fuscata  and the rich array of tool use by wild        chimpanzees orangutans         Pongo pymaeus  and capuchin monkeys         Cebus spp Whiten et al  de Waal  Hirata et al         Perry et al  van Schaik et al  However much less attention has been        paid to         social culture  which we might define as the transmission of social        positions preferences habits and attitudes        Social culture is obviously harder to document than tool use In human culture for        instance it is easy to tell if people eat with knife and fork or with chopsticks but to        notice if a culture is egalitarian or hierarchical warm or distant collectivistic or        individualistic takes time and is difficult to capture in behavioral measures A        welldocumented monkey example of social culture is the inheritance of rank positions in        macaque and baboon societies The future position in the hierarchy of a newborn female can        be predicted with almost one hundred percent certainty on the basis of her mothers rank        Females with relatives in high places are born with a silver spoon in their mouth so to        speak whereas those of lowly origin will spend their life at the bottom Despite its        stability the system depends on learning Early in life the young monkey finds out        against which opponents it can expect help from her mother and sisters When sparring with        peer A she may utter screams that recruit massive support to defeat A But against peer B        she can scream her lungs out and nothing happens Consequently she will come to dominate A        but not B Experiments manipulating the presence of family members have found that when        support dwindles dominant females are unable to maintain their positions Chapais  In        other words the kinbased hierarchy is maintained for generation after generation through        social rather than genetic transmission        Returning to the issue of aggressive behavior here the effects of social culture can be        felt as well Without any drugs or brain lesions one experiment managed to turn monkeys        into pacifists Juveniles of two different macaque species were placed together day and        night for five months Rhesus monkeys         Macaca mulatta  known as quarrelsome and violent were housed        with the more tolerant and easygoing stumptail monkeys         M arctoides  Figure  Stumptail monkeys easily reconcile        with their opponents after fights by holding each others hips the socalled holdbottom        ritual whereas reconciliations are rare in rhesus monkeys Because the mixedspecies        groups were dominated by the stumptails physical aggression was rare The atmosphere was        relaxed and after a while all of the monkeys became friends Juveniles of the two species        played together groomed together and slept in large mixed huddles Most importantly the        rhesus monkeys developed peacemaking skills on a par with those of their more tolerant        group mates Even when at the end of the experiment both species were separated the        rhesus monkeys still showed three times more reconciliation and grooming behaviors after        fights than typical of their kind de Waal and Johanowicz  Primates thus can adopt        social behavior under the influence of others which opens the door to social culture        Not unlike rhesus monkeys baboons have a reputation for fierce competition and nasty        fights With the study by Robert Sapolsky and Lisa Share published in this issue of         PLoS Biology  we now have the first field evidence that primates can go        the flower power route Sapolsky and Share  Wild baboons developed an exceptionally        pacific social tradition that outlasted the individuals who established it For years        Sapolsky has documented how olive baboons         Papio anubis  on the plains of the Masai Mara in Kenya wage        wars of nerves compromising their rivals immune systems and pushing up the level of their        blood cortisol Sapolsky  An accident of history however selectively wiped out all        the male bullies of his main study troop As a result the number of aggressive incidents        dropped dramatically This by itself was not so surprising It became more interesting when        it was discovered that the behavioral change was maintained for a decade Baboon males        migrate after puberty hence fresh young males enter troops all the time resulting in a        complete turnover of males during the intervening decade Nevertheless compared with        troops around it the affected troop upheld its reduced aggression increased friendly        behavior and exceptionally low stress levels The conclusion from this natural experiment        is that like human societies each animal society has its own ecological and behavioral        history which determines its prevalent social style        It is somewhat ironic that at a time when researchers on human aggression are        increasingly attracted albeit with a far more sophisticated approach to the Lorenzian        idea of a biological basis of aggression Enserink  students of animal behavior are        beginning to look at its possible cultural basis There is no reason for animals with a        development as slow as a baboon with adulthood achieved in five or six years not to be        influenced in every way by the environment in which they grow up including the social        environment How this influence takes place is a point of much debate and remains unclear        in the case of the peaceful male baboons in the Masai Mara Given their mobility the males        themselves are unlikely transmitters of social traditions within their natal troop        Therefore Sapolsky and Share look at the females for an answerfemale baboons stay all        their lives in the same troop By reacting positively to certain kinds of behavior for        example females may be able to steer male attitudes in a new direction This complex        problem is hard to unravel with a single study especially in the absence of        experimentation Yet the main two points of this discovery are loud and clear social        behavior observed in nature may be a product of culture and even the fiercest primates do        not forever need to stay this way        Let us hope this applies to humanity as well
