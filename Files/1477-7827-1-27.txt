 Background The egg is a transcriptionally inactive cell and as such is a storehouse of maternal proteins and mRNA required for fertilization and the initiation of zygotic development However many of the proteins comprising the mature egg proteome have yet to be identified Identification and molecular characterization of such proteins will provide much insight into the regulation of fertilization and early embryogenesis The surface of the egg consists of an extracellular matrix or zona pellucida and plasma membrane or oolemma which sits beneath The three proteins that comprise the zona pellucida ZP1 ZP2 and ZP3 and their roles in sperm binding are well characterized 1 In contrast little is known about the surface proteins of the egg plasma membrane Almeida et al 2 demonstrated the presence of 6 1 and v 3 integrins at the egg surface by indirect immunofluorescence and PCR and showed involvement of the 6 1 integrin in sperm egg fusion by peptide and antibody inhibition assays Currently however the functional significance of egg surface integrins is unclear Data from Zhu and Evans 3 substantiates the involvement of 4 9 integrin and 6 integrin in sperm egg binding while other results have been contradictory 4 5 see Primakoff and Myles 6 for review There is now compelling evidence demonstrating that CD9 a tetraspan membrane protein is present on the oolemma and essential for sperm egg fusion possibly by organizing functional multimolecular complexes in the egg 7 Glycosyl phophatidyniositol GPI anchored proteins have also been described on the oolemma and implicated in sperm egg fusion removal of GPI anchored protein from the egg plasma membrane results in greatly reduced fertilization rates without affecting sperm zona pellucida binding 8 Other egg surface molecules are the adhesion molecules NCAM VCAM 1 ICAM 1 and ECAD 9 and the selectins 10 Additionally the IgG receptor 11 complement receptors C1q 12 CD35 and CD11b 13 and the Fc gamma receptors 14 exhibit oolemmal expression in a variety of mammalian species Molecular chaperones bind to nascent proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum ER promote proper protein folding and prevent the aggregation of nonnative and misfolded proteins Most are constitutively expressed at low levels in almost all cell types but a number are upregulated in response to cellular stresses and these are known as the heat shock proteins HSPs A number of molecular chaperones are retained in the ER due to a conserved signal sequence at the C terminal end of the protein KDEL which binds to a receptor in the Golgi apparatus 15 More recently however molecular chaperones bearing the ER retention signal have been localized to the surface of different cell types Calnexin Calreticulin GRP94 glycoprotein 96 and GRP78 BiP have been identified on the cell surface of immature thymocytes 16 17 Cell surface expression of GRP94 is found in lymphocytes and lymphoid like cells from several vertebrate species and is phylogenetically conserved 18 Calnexin has been found on the surface of pro B cells 19 as well as in a variety of mammalian culture cells 20 and a number of HSPs are found expressed on the cell surface in human and murine tumor cells 21 22 23 24 Calreticulin GRP78 and PDI were described on the plasma membrane of different cell types 25 26 27 28 GRP78 GRP94 and PDI have been found on the surface of rat exocrine pancreatic cells 29 30 and GRP78 cell surface expression was recently shown in human endothelial cells 31 A number of reports have characterized constitutive expression of HSP70 and HSP90 in both immature oocytes and ovulated eggs from various species 32 33 34 35 36 HSP70 and HSP89 are constitutively synthesized in the immature preovulatory mouse oocyte although the expression is not heat inducible 37 Levels of HSP70 mRNA decrease following oocyte maturation and ovulation 38 and HSP70 is one of the first genes to be transcribed at the onset of zygotic gene activation in the early 2 cell mouse embryo 39 40 Interestingly while previous investigators did not localize HSP70 to the oolemma they did demonstrate that the presence of anti HSP70 antibody reduces bovine sperm egg binding in vitro indicating a possible role for HSP70 in fertilization 41 An egg surface sperm receptor identified on sea urchin oocytes bears a sperm binding domain with sequence similarity to HSP70 and its recombinant protein binds sperm and inhibits fertilization in vitro 42 Among the other molecular chaperones described here calreticulin has been found in oocytes from a number of species 43 Interestingly Munoz Gotera et al 44 showed that calreticulin localizes to cortical granules in guinea pig oocytes and is released into the perivitelline space following activation PDI has been identified in sea urchin eggs 45 though localized only to the ER Calnexin GRP78 GRP94 and ORP150 have not been previously identified in oocytes of any species In order to identify maternal proteins present in the ovulated mouse egg we performed 2D gel electrophoresis of proteins extracted from 2850 whole mature eggs and cored those protein spots that appeared to be most abundant Concurrently we surface labelled zona free eggs with biotin and performed 2D avidin blotting to attempt to identify surface proteins Proteins that appeared to be surface labelled were then cross referenced between corresponding silver stained 2D gels of egg extracts and compared to microsequence data from the coomassie stained reference gel We report here the preliminary identification of nine highly abundant HSPs and related chaperones in the mature mouse egg that also appear to be surface labelled To support the hypothesis that these molecular chaperones localize to the egg surface we performed indirect immunofluorescence analysis and found that antibodies to HSP90 GRP94 GRP78 and Calreticulin specifically bind to proteins on the oolemma Methods Egg isolation Mature metaphase II arrested mouse eggs were collected from superovulated 24 gram ICR female mice Harlan Breeders Indianapolis Hilltop Labs Philadelphia primed with 7 IU PMSG 48 hr and 7 IU HCG 15 hr prior to egg collection Cumulus oocyte complexes were collected from oviducts of superovulated ICR strain females in medium 199 M199 Gibco BRL Invitrogen Carlsbad CA Cumulus cells were removed by treating

incubated in M199 medium overlaid with light mineral oil for 3 h at 37 C in a 5 CO 2 incubator to allow for recovery before use 2D Electrophoresis The eggs were extracted in Celis lysis buffer see 46

of the egg extracts IEF was performed using the Mini PROTEAN II tube cell apparatus according to the manufacturer s protocol Bio Rad Richmond CA with ampholines of pH 3 5 5 30 3 5 10 40 5 7 20 and 7 9 10 Pharmacia Biotech Uppsala Sweden The tube gels were placed on 12 minislab gels and the focused proteins were separated in the second dimension at 20 mA per gel The gel was stained with coomassie BioRad Hercules CA for 30 min washed and abundant protein spots as determined by intensity of staining were cored and submitted for microsequencing by TMS Protein microsequencing Peptide sequencing was performed by the W M Keck Foundation Center for Biomedical Mass Spectrometry at the University of Virginia Surface labeled egg proteins were identified on 2D streptavidin immunoblots and corresponding silver stained protein spots were cored from a 1 5 mm thick 2D SDS PAGE gel that had been run in tandem The gel core was diced into small pieces destained with 1 1 v v 30 mM potassium ferricyanide and 100 mM sodium thiosulfate reduced in 10 mM DTT and alkylated in 50 mM iodoacetamide in 0 1 M ammonium bicarbonate After reagents were removed the gel pieces were incubated with 12 5 ng l trypsin in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate overnight at 37 C Digested peptides were extracted from the gel fragments in 50 acetonitrile 5 formic acid and evaporated to 25 l for microsequencing Peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry using a capillary HPLC column interfaced to a Finnigan MAT TSQ7000 electrospray ionization tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer Selected peptides were mass analyzed using capillary liquid chromatography yielding a collision activated dissociation CAD spectra from which the amino acid sequence could be determined Amino acid sequences were entered into and searched against the protein and DNA databanks using Sequest software available from GenBank Surface labeling This procedure is explained in detail in Coonrod et al 1999 8 Briefly after collection zona free eggs were washed six times in BWW medium Irvine Scientific Santa Ana CA containing 100 g ml polyvinylalcohol PVA Sigma St Louis MO biotinylated with 2 mg ml Sulfo NHS biotin Pierce Rockford IL in BWW PVA for 7 min at room temperature and washed six times in BWW PVA Biotinylated eggs were extracted in Celis buffer and run on a 2D gel as described above The proteins were then electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes at 125 mA for 45 min The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in PBS with 0 1 Tween and 5 dried milk for 30 min at room temperature washed 1 in PBS 0 1 Tween and probed with 20 mg ml streptavidin HRP Pierce Rockford IL for 30 min at room temperature The blots were washed 3 15 min in PBS 0 1 Tween and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence Amersham Corp Buckinghamshire UK for 5 min An identical number of eggs were collected and remained untreated prior to protein extraction and proteins from these eggs were separated according to the same protocol outlined above This gel was silver stained according to Hochstrasser et al 48 Indirect immunofluorescence with zona free Eggs Antibody Reagents All antibodies used in these experiments were purchased from Affinity Bioreagents Golden CO and all were diluted in M199 media to desired concentration Anti GRP94 clone 9G10 is a rat monoclonal IgG antibody used at 50 g ml Purified rat IgG was diluted to 50 g ml for use as a negative control Anti calnexin clone AF18 Anti HSP90 clone 3B6 and anti HSP70 5A5 are mouse monoclonal IgG antibodies and were used at a 1 100 dilution Purified mouse IgG was diluted 1 100 for use as a negative control The secondary antibodies used were cy3 conjugated anti rat or mouse antibody at 1 200 Anti calreticulin cat PA3 900 and anti GRP78 cat PA1 014 are rabbit polyclonal antibodies and were used at a 1 200 dilution Normal rabbit serum was used at 1 200 as a negative control The secondary antibody used was a cy3 conjgated anti rabbit antibody at 1 200 Hoechst chromatin stain was used at 10 g ml in PBS in order to determine which if any eggs had been activated or were undergoing degeneration as a consequence of manipulation Zona free eggs were prepared as described above and allowed to recover for 3 h at 37 C in a 5 CO 2 incubator before use After the recovery period eggs were washed through 4 50 l wash drops of M199 media see 8 for recipe Live eggs were then incubated with primary antibody or control IgG as noted The eggs were subsequently washed in M199 media and incubated in the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h at 37 C in a 5 CO 2 incubator to determine the localization of primary antibody reactivity Eggs were then washed in M199 media and incubated in 10 g ml Hoechst chromatin stain at 37 C for 10 min Staining of the live eggs was visualized using ultra violet light and a fluorescent filter on a light microscope Standard 18 model Zeiss Microimaging Thornwood NY Results 2D Electrophoresis and TMS identification of abundant egg proteins 2D gel electrophoresis of whole egg extract from 2850 mature metaphase II arrested untreated mouse eggs was performed in order to identify some of the more abundant proteins of the egg proteome The 2D gel repertoire of whole untreated eggs is presented in Fig 1 Abundant coomassie stained egg protein spots were cored from the gel and submitted for TMS analysis Of the spots submitted a subset matched known chaperones HSP proteins these are HSP70 HSP90 GRP78 GRP94 Calreticulin Calnexin PDI and ORP150 as indicated by labelled arrows in Fig 1 displayed in Table 1 Biotinylation and avidin blotting identifies surface labeled egg proteins Separation of surface labeled biotinylated egg proteins followed by avidin blotting was utilized to identify surface labeled proteins For these experiments proteins from 800 zona free biotinylated mouse eggs were extracted The extracts from the treated eggs were separated by 2D gel electrophoresis electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with streptavidin HRP Biotinylated proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence Another 800 untreated zona free eggs were extracted separated by 2D electrophoresis and the gel was silver stained The 2D gel repertoire of biotin labeled oolemmal surface proteins is presented in Fig 2A The corresponding silver stained 2D gel of untreated eggs from which protein spots were cored for TMS is presented in Fig 2B To ensure that plasma membrane proteins were biotinylated and cytoplasmic proteins were not the blot shown in Fig 2Bwas stripped of streptavidin HRP and re probed with antibodies to tubulin and actin two known cytoskeletal proteins The antibodies to the cytoplasmic markers only recognized two spots on the blot and these spots correspond to the expected mass and pI of tubulin and actin data not shown No surface labeling of these cytoskeletal proteins occurred validating the surface specificity of the labeling method Additionally 2D blots of non biotinylated oocytes were probed with streptavidin HRP Two proteins in the unlabeled eggs bound streptavidin corresponding to endogenous non specific avidin binding proteins not included in the repertoire of surface labeled proteins data not shown see figures in Coonrod et al 46 Immunofluorescence with antibodies to surface labeled chaperones HSPs In order to provide additional evidence for surface localization antibodies to five of the eight molecular chaperones identified by surface labelling were used in immunofluorescence experiments Hoechst chromatin stain was utilized to determine whether eggs had parthenogenetically activated activated eggs are mitotic and exhibit two chromatin poles rather than one as indicated by an asterisk in Figs 3 4 5 When zona free mature eggs were incubated with anti GRP94 the antibody specifically bound to isolated regions of the plasma membrane in several eggs however the majority of eggs did not show any reactivity Fig 3A In contrast incubating in rat IgG alone did not result in any antibody reactivity Fig 3B It is not clear from these preliminary results what common feature this subpopulation of positively staining eggs shared in common but there does not appear to be an association between activation status and the degree of positive staining Anti HSP90 antibodies reacted very strongly with the egg plasma membrane of the majority of those eggs examined Fig 4A Incubating eggs in mouse IgG alone did not result in any reactivity Fig 4B Intriguingly HSP90 staining was primarily localized to the microvillar region of normal eggs the region opposite the pole containing the metaphase chromatin whereas the staining became delocalized and more intense following activation Anti calreticulin antibodies bound to the plasma membrane in approximately half of the eggs and no association with activation status was observed Fig 5A Anti GRP78 antibodies bound to the plasma membrane in the majority of the eggs examined Fig 5B Incubating eggs in normal rabbit sera alone did not result in any reactivity Fig 5C Neither anti HSP70 nor anti calnexin antibodies resulted in positive immunostaining in any of the eggs examined data not shown A more rigorous quantitative analysis of the surface localization of these molecular chaperones to the oolemma is now required Discussion It has been estimated that individual mammalian cells express from 5 000 to 10 000 proteins at any given point in time 49 Analysis of the 2D gel shown in Fig 1shows from 3000 eggs only several hundred proteins can be resolved by coomassie staining and therefore these proteins are likely some of the most abundant proteins in the ovulated mouse egg In this study we have found that a subset of these highly abundant proteins are molecular chaperones It will be of interest to establish the functional role of these proteins in the egg and early embryo HSP70 is one of the first genes to be expressed following zygotic gene activation in the two cell mouse embryo 38 39 40 and appears to play a role in developmental processes in a number of species 50 51 52 53 Endogenous HSP90 has also been implicated in developmental regulation in the mouse 52 and GRP78 is described as having a stress response function during avian development 54 Activation of the zygotic genome initiates an accumulation of embryonic transcripts in the early two cell embryo and this likely requires machinery to ensure the accurate translation and folding of nascent proteins The HSPs and chaperones found in the mature egg may represent a maternal stockpile of such folding machinery Another preliminary finding of this study is that several molecular chaperones appear to be localized to the egg surface Although HSPs were originally identified as a family of proteins that are upregulated in response to cell stress most are also endogenously expressed under physiological conditions Constitutive expression of a number of HSPs and molecular chaperones has been characterized in immature oocytes and mature mouse eggs 38 39 40 though none as yet have been localized to the oolemma Members of the chaperone HSP protein families including those containing an ER retention signal e g KDEL KKXX have been described on the cell surface in a wide variety of cell types 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 27 26 28 30 31 though this phenomenon has not been previously described in oocytes or eggs How these proteins are escaping ER retention is not yet known It is possible that in association with another protein or protein complex the chaperone s KDEL sequence is sterically prevented from binding with ER retention receptors and this allows the protein to be transported to the plasma membrane Another hypothesis is that alternative folding of the chaperone protein itself masks the retention sequence allowing it to escape the ER Further studies are needed to confirm the surface localization of these molecules and to determine which if any of these potential mechanisms are being employed The functional significance of surface expression of ER chaperones in different cell types has yet to be determined A sperm receptor identified on the surface of sea urchin oocytes has an extracellular domain that shows sequence similarity to HSP70 and appears to be required for fertilization 42 Additionally members of the HSP family are known to be involved in the regulation of apoptosis see 55 for review HSP70 and GRP78 both have anti apoptotic activity whereas HSP90 appears to have both pro apoptotic and anti apoptotic activities depending on the specific stimuli received Early bovine embryos cultured in the presence of HSP70 antibodies exhibit increased apoptosis and reduced embryo viability 41 However it is still controversial as to whether the unfertilized egg is actively apoptotic or undergoes necrosis in the reproductive tract During development selective cell death by apoptosis becomes crucial and chaperone molecules in the egg may play a role in later apoptotic events Future experiments need to be performed before the significance of findings presented here can be addressed both at the functional and mechanistic level In general the molecular chaperones are proving to play a wide variety of roles in diverse cellular processes and this list will likely grow as our understanding of these molecules increases Conclusions Using 2D electrophoresis and TMS we have identified eight molecular chaperone proteins that are abundantly expressed in the mature mouse egg Of these proteins GRP 94 GRP 78 Calreticulin and HSP 90 can be surface labeled by biotin and appear to be localizing to the egg surface based on preliminary immunofluoresence data These results provide preilimary evidence for the presence of these molecular chaperones on the egg surface
