              Dear Alumnus      When was the last time you stopped at IUPUI since you graduated Was      it as recently as last year that you could find your way around or has      it been so long that if you were to visit the main campus you could not      recognize it Whether you are a recent or notsorecent graduate I      invite you to watch us grow as a maturing urban university on the go In      addition to expanded physical facilities since the completion of Science      Engineering and Technology Building Phase Two several of the programs in      the school have expanded in terms of student and faculty size the      research and development contracts with federal and state agencies and      private industry exceeded one million dollars in value for the first time      last year interaction of faculty and students with the other schools on      campus increased drastically in terms of joint research projects on      medical imaging computational neuroscience and biomechanics and the      partnership with Naval Avionics Warfare Center and Naval Weapons Center      flourished with the moving of Electronic Manufacturing Productivity      Facility from California to a new facility within one mile of the main      campus      Since the beginning of our Annual Fund in  alumni have been      important partners in the development of our programs In September we      will begin our annual telefund Gifts received will be used in various      ways Our school is continually challenged to provide stateoftheart      training for its students In order to do this laboratories must be      developed and maintained with equipment that will provide firstrate      handson experience for our students Also there is the area of      student support The departments and programs within the School of      Engineering and Technology provide thousands of dollars of scholarship      support each year to students Still there is great need especially in      the way of endowed scholarships These funds would insure that      scholarships are available to students as long as there are students to      support I am confident that as a proud graduate of our school you will      participate in supporting our telefund and extend the promise of Purdue      programs at Indianapolis to many new students in the s
