 Dear Alumnus When was the last time you stopped at IUPUI since you graduated Was it as recently as last year that you could find your way around or has it been so long that if you were to visit the main campus you could not recognize it Whether you are a recent or not so recent graduate I invite you to watch us grow as a maturing urban university on the go In addition to expanded physical facilities since the completion of Science Engineering and Technology Building Phase Two several of the programs in the school have expanded in terms of student and faculty size the research and development contracts with federal and state agencies and private industry exceeded one million dollars in value for the first time last year interaction of faculty and students with the other schools on campus increased drastically in terms of joint research projects on medical imaging computational neuroscience and biomechanics and the partnership with Naval Avionics Warfare Center and Naval Weapons Center flourished with the moving of Electronic Manufacturing Productivity Facility from California to a new facility within one mile of the main campus Since the beginning of our Annual Fund in 1984 alumni have been important partners in the development of our programs In September we will begin our annual telefund Gifts received will be used in various ways Our school is continually challenged to provide state of the art training for its students In order to do this laboratories must be developed and maintained with equipment that will provide first rate hands on experience for our students Also there is the area of student support The departments and programs within the School of Engineering and Technology provide thousands of dollars of scholarship support each year to students Still there is great need especially in the way of endowed scholarships These funds would insure that scholarships are available to students as long as there are students to support I am confident that as a proud graduate of our school you will participate in supporting our telefund and extend the promise of Purdue programs at Indianapolis to many new students in the 1990s
