 The Curse of Slate Last Friday April 18 was a good news bad news kind of day for Dean Buntrock The good news was that he and his wife were No 1 on the Slate 60 Quarterly Update That is as of the end of March they had donated more money to charity in 1997 than any other Americans that we could find out about 26 million to be exact to St Olaf College in Minnesota But no good deed goes unpunished That same day a stockholder rebellion more or less forced Buntrock to offer to step aside as head of WMX Corp formerly known as Waste Management Inc a company he founded and has run for decades We trust he takes comfort in the thought that his beneficiaries appreciate him even if his stockholders don t Meanwhile friends of Lewis and Dorothy Cullman No 3 on the list with a 10 million gift to Yale and another 10 million to the New York Public Library were quick to note that they did not recognize Lewis Cullman in our alleged photograph of the generous couple We did have a photograph of the Cullmans posing with the president of the library Paul LeClerc We then made the classic error of cropping out the wrong man We hope nobody saw Dorothy Cullman with the library president and thought Poor Mr Cullman This is the thanks he gets for his 10 million In any event through the magic of Internet technology i e the ability to erase your mistakes we have restored Dorothy to the arms of her husband Our apologies to all three Fray of Hope Slate s Fraymistress Pavia Rosati has been on leave the past few weeks and will be out of The Fray for a few more weeks During her absence two of our earliest and most energetic Fraygrants have been filling in CoHost Nedfagan is the handle of Ned Fagan and CoHost IrvSnod is also known as Irving Snodgrass Both of them lead rich nonvirtual lives in faraway locales so we appreciate their involvement in and dedication to Slate s community bulletin board If you haven t yet entered the Fray please give it a try You must register in order to post a message it s easy and free but you can lurk i e read what other people are saying without registering Michael Kinsley
