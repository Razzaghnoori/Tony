 Glass Wear About 30 years ago I attended an exhibition of corsets at a great costume collection in Manchester England In a dim room were gathered a dozen elegant undergarments each in its own glass case and each accompanied by at least three paragraphs of scholarly labeling about materials structure and shape Chosen from a collection of hundreds of corsets these garments dated only from the second quarter of the 18 th century They were masterpieces of delicate craftsmanship no two were exactly the same Looking at them was like looking at ancient Etruscan bronzes or Renaissance enameled boxes But it was also like a private showing Nobody else was there In those days costume was dear only to a few obsessed antiquarians with no connection to the mad scuffle of fashion in real life A show back then at the Metropolitan Museum of Art s Costume Institute might have displayed a tired ecclesiastical vestment from 17 th century Spain or a stiffly embroidered linen nightcap looking inert and inscrutable No longer The current Costume Institute show Our New Clothes Acquisitions of the 1990s vibrates with modern energy Under curator Richard Martin s direction fashions of the moment resonate backward into the past and the modes of olden days awaken to new life next to their modern revisions Martin also succeeded in intermingling history and the present day in an earlier show called The Ceaseless Century by which he meant the 18 th There were reasons for picking that century Chic outfits in good condition date back only as far as about 1700 or maybe a little before that Except for bits and pieces no gorgeous suits from Shakespeare s day survive no gold bordered gowns from Mona Lisa s wardrobe none of King Richard III s rich doublets fitted to his humpback The dazzling styles of the distant past live only in pictures A fashion designer can put old imagery to use But a museum collector needs history in material form the better to display its links with the productions of more recent ateliers The earliest and most magnificent item in the current show is a bright salmon pink English lady s ensemble from 1708 made of silk damask brocaded in bold patterns with multicolored silk floss and metallic thread The strong color and buoyant presence of this ornate dress command our attention the dress has no mustiness at all Another French ensemble from around 1760 all in canary yellow silk taffeta self trimmed in miles of applied pleated ruffles creates a similar effect These dramatic dresses easily compete in intensity or sensationalism with the vivid works by Issey Miyake and Alix Gr s nearby Some 18 th century men s outfits are equally bold especially a French coat dated between 1787 92 which is to say just at the Revolutionary moment This lean unadorned high collared garment in plain fire engine red wool contrasts wonderfully with a peach velvet and green satin coat and waistcoat men s ensemble from about 1765 its cuffs and vest covered with embroideries its buttons glittering with paste diamonds The latter was made at a time when the king s head was still on and refined elegance could still relax and keep refining A bright blue checked linen tailcoat from America dated around 1815 neat and tight fitting with self covered buttons is a nice contrast to both of these Its summery simplicity suggests fresh American artlessness and love of convenience The antique menswear in this show has a clarity of line and color that claims an affinity with the surges of invention in men s clothes right now There s Tom Ford s red velvet suit from his 1996 97 winter collection displayed next to the red wool French Revolutionary coat Its old fashioned 1970s redness sets up vibrations with older fashioned 1790s redness and both look timely A brotherhood of male expression communicates across time and we start to imagine the red coats of the future Jean Paul Gaultier of course has already begun after all this is the only designer who has repeatedly offered skirts for men Gaultier s dark red and white man s jacket in silk and rayon twill has a modern classical shape but it s printed with variably modulated stripes that form the vision of a nude Greek classical torso complete with arms and thighs At the groin the two sides of the jacket discreetly curve apart to unveil the wearer s own black trouser clad crotch Numerous white dresses are gathered in a group The earliest is another French 18 th century damask ensemble It s in ivory and dates from 1770 and its flavor and trimmings are consciously echoed by an American wedding dress from about 1880 The intervening snowy marvels are in cotton crisp and vigorous or frothy and delicate followed by the modern silky columns that cling fall or drape in unexpected ways The possibilities of feminine white turn out to be infinite to mirror any emotional and erotic nuance in the souls of women for three centuries The exhibit made me hope that the fashion of the future will be all the more liberated for seeking its sources in the liberties of the past But the show made me realize something else as well that our present clothes are already museum pieces The largest change in fashion since 1968 has been an immense new consciousness of what clothes mean so that people have got used to thinking about what their own outfits say By bringing together old and new this exhibition encourages that habit of looking for significance in our own garments While we stare with detached sociological attention at the garb of generations who lived in complex past times we re invited to stare the same way at contemporary modes to see them as the historical artifacts of our own fraught epoch And the gulf between Those Days and These once unbridgeable starts to disappear
