forever The recent big life events are the marriage of Barbra Streisand and James Brolin and the impending divorce of Demi Moore and Bruce Willis Because of their deadlines the supermarket tabs were unable to reveal this week if they managed to breach Streisand s perimeter of security But the rest of the gossip media did their best to glean details of the wedding when they weren t being driven mad by Streisand loudspeakers blaring music from the same heavy metal band White Zombie once used by the military to drive former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega from his compound according to the New York Daily News The News reported that Streisand a well known um perfectionist almost delayed the much rescheduled wedding because the caterer delivered San Pellegrino water instead of the

ancient frozen corpses that occasionally turns up in the Alps Brolin melted her He was so overcome during the ceremony reports the News that he blubbered Streisand remained dry eyed The News did not report if this had anything to do with the terms of the couple s prenuptial agreement Way back in 1987 when they got married Bruce Willis was a mere TV actor and Demi Moore was just one of the members of the Hollywood Brat Pack and neither was thinking about a prenuptial says the Star That s why the tabloid is salivating over the prospect of just how these now full fledged movie stars will divide their 150 million fortune which consists of everything from real estate to an interest in the Planet Hollywood restaurants to a doll collection that numbers in the thousands All three supermarket tabs agree the reason for the split was the basic one the wandering eye The Star and the Globe both place the bulk of the blame on Willis I can t go on with this charade Moore sobbed to a friend in vintage tabloid speak according to the Star The publication links Willis with everyone from his young Armageddon co star Liv Tyler to a group of Hawaiian Tropic swimsuit models But Moore who once played a liposuctioned Hester Prynne is not portrayed only as the wronged woman The Star brings up her flirtations with actors Brad Pitt and yet another Armageddon star Ben Affleck The National Enquirer reports Moore hired a private eye to detail Willis activities which included it says both individual girlfriends and a penchant for hanging out at strip clubs The couple agreed to split after the

Day brunch at the Ramada Inn in Farmington N M where the family had gone to be with Moore s dying mother a friend called Willis with the news the Enquirer alleges After the two stars had a shouting match Willis stormed out and installed himself in the Best Western motel across the street The Globe in a contrarian mood blames Moore It reports Willis latest philandering was retaliation for her dates with who else Leonardo DiCaprio In the tabloid world DiCaprio is becoming the equivalent of the Norse god Loki a handsome mischievous shape shifter who leaves chaos in his wake The Moore Willis split is not the only uncoupling of the month All three supermarket tabs report the end of the marriage of singers Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown a decision the Globe says was cemented by his latest arrest this time for allegedly having touched a woman against her will The Globe says the usually forgiving Houston is unmoved by his plight but both the Enquirer and the Star say she is concerned

constantly the Enquirer quotes her as saying But it s all for a higher purpose That old biological clock is really racing away she says Reproduction is also the reason newly coupled Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt can t keep their hands off each other according to the Globe The star of Friends allegedly confided to a friend Every time Brad and I sleep together I hope I ll conceive I m totally
