 all right do you have any kids okay no i ve got two and it is hard to find day care for them what um what do you think needs to be the criteria set for those oh what would you like to see in one well i i ve seen the bad side in most of them uh huh i took my son to a day care one time when he was just you know just uh not even three months old and uh you know it was a desperate thing and uh when my husband went to pick him up she he said that the baby had been crying the whole time he was asleep but you know how they cry in their sleep yeah and uh you know this uh couldn t catch his breath even in his sleep and that turned me off of day cares i bet and then when i took uh i ve seen these kids that uh it s a church volleyball they have a day care set up there for people playing volleyball and uh one of the girls was real mean to the kid uh huh hm and that was you know he she d just she had treated him like family does you know and um yeah it you know it uh i know most of the girls up there and the ones that keeps my kids are real good uh my son doesn t like people too much yeah but uh when when we leave there he uh gives the girl a hug and tells her i ll miss you so you know oh well that s good so i know they treat him good yeah uh is it i don t know maybe would you think a better student to teacher ratio do they have too many kids in most day cares for the people they have yeah yeah uh i don t know much about day cares itself you know uh you know this is more of just the nursery for three and under um hum and uh there s only there s two people taking care of about five kids uh where i m where i m taking my two uh huh and but uh in most places yeah they got forty five kids at best i guess oh my goodness you know and maybe about four teachers and that s a lot of kids yeah um we don t yeah we don t have any but we have you know plenty of sisters and brothers that that have them and uh i m not sure that there is a solution to that as far as uh the day there you know everybody has in their mind the kind of day care that they want but it seems you know that there s not really the perfect one out there no there s not nobody can take care of your kids better than you right and that s not even possible anymore i don t think to be able to take care of your own kids without you know with everybody working these days well i had to quit my job because of uh my my two you know uh day care wise or babysittingwise and stuff uh because you know my sister was keeping them uh uh we just lucked out and she uh met a military man who lived down here and we came down here for TI uh huh and uh so i had her baby sitting but she was six months pregnant and it was getting too much for her so i just quit i d rather quit and take care of my own kids than let somebody else raise them oh yeah yeah that seems probably the best way to do it well you know they re getting raised right yeah yeah um i haven t really the only day cares that i have been familiar with are the ones that are local here with the churches and they seem to from my experience be the best at what they re doing just because of what they re based on yeah yeah if um i i know one church that uh there was some problems with but that was just uh basically a personal problem between the mother and the uh person that was taking in charge oh but uh the church uh day care that my kids uh they don t go to a day care you know it s uh during Sunday School and stuff uh the people there are really nice uh huh yeah yeah i think i think that s that s important yeah well they i think it s one of the important things um hum if uh because if they don t like it uh you can t get them that separation thing and i need that my kids i need to cut the strings on them they re not very old but yeah how old are they three and uh four and two oh so you know they re they re good kids you know they do bad things but they re good kids um hum but you know kids kids do those yeah uh but i don t like the punishment the day care does you know i don t know exactly what they do but i don t want no one punishing my kids but myself uh huh right and that s another problem with day care because you re not there so you don t what they re doing right right and if yeah they re probably i would think needs to be i don t know if they have any type of uh formal or informal spontaneous or routine drop ins of agencies you know people checking up on like they do nursing homes you know they drop in to see if you re meeting all of the requirements by law and and i think they need to do that with day cares and just see what s going on yeah that s that s that s something that should be brought up with these people so but i m not really sure i don t know if they do it either to be truthful yeah i don t either it s not until you have kids i guess you worry about those things well uh with me i just decided not to face it and you know in most in in so many words you know in one way or the other i just decided not to face that issue and i just keep them with me yeah uh huh well i don t know what we ve done to solve any of this but i ve enjoyed talking with you yeah so have i oh and welcome to Texas oh well thanks and i guess i we ve we ve been on long enough so you have a good day all right bye bye thank you bye bye
