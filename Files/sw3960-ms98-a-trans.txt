                okay Jean what what have you recently painted   well im not uh painting of the artist variety what i like to do is i like to paint the inside of a house   umhum   paint cabinets or paint furniture but im not doing much of that right now havent for quite some time   umhum uhhuh   how about you   well i painted a shed this summer that i built and i went and borrowed a uh a paint sprayer from a a fellow that i know im good friends with and its the only way to go  i painted eight gallons of paint um i i put some stain and stuff on a on a redwood deck i made and i painted the uh       my shed and it probably took me about six hours but it was just its just incredible how much easier it is uh with a spray gun how much smoother it goes on and even and more professional looking and um i dont know i was just really pleased with it do you use some kind of a power painter rollers or something when you paint or   just just uh old fashioned brush and roller yes yeah when   is that right you you you do it the hard way i shouldnt   yes uh a a very messy way too uh we havent done much painting   these sound so hard but      interior or exterior in the last uh two years two and a half years we we bought a mobile home and with the natural oak   umhum   or natural wood paneling on the inside we dont have that painting to to contend with but uh my husband has painted uh some of our storage buildings and when he put the uh skirting around the the mobile home then it had to be uh sealed painted   umhum um how do you uh oh i would imagine that the weathers pretty hard on paints down there is it is it not   yes it is uh probably the summers the summers are harder winters actually than the winters are because it uh the sun you know bakes and dries them out and we dont have an a lot of freezing weather like you would in Idaho   uhhuh uhhuh how frequently do you have to paint then   uh usually not more often than about every oh three to five years depending on the type of finish that you use and too the the type of wood that youre putting it on   how how do you uh prep your wood is there a fast easy way or is it just the old scraper brush on the outside is i guess what im speaking of   oh that is the um the only thing that that i know of we um were fortunate in that the last uh painting work that my husband did was on new finish so it didnt have to be   umhum   prepped anyway we had painted uh or had paint i had a house painted that we owned over in uh Greenville and we had it brushed and scraped and uh a primer coat brushed on and then the in fact i think there was two coats of primer and then three coats of the uh paint that went on that it was an old frame frame house but it lasted very very well it must have been on there nearly ten years before it needed painting again   hm inside how do you keep the paint off your carpet or do you have that problem  anytime i try something like that i got paint all over the carpet       and were in there with uh i have to use water base paint and and uh in there with a big wet towel and about every three minutes i got to stop and clean my paint specks up all over   yeah that sounds familiar too my husband hates to see me get the painting bug because he says im i make a a terrible mess and i guess i do but um   huh   uh in the times that he has helped me taping the uh one of those plastic drop cloths to the baseboard   yes   and then setting chairs or something against it to keep the keep it from getting kicked loose is about the best way to keep it you know from speckling all around   umhum uh   how did you get involved in the uh this project that were doing on the       voice recording   uh Brian White from down there as i mentioned before sent his his wife and my uh and my wife of course are sisters are sisters and they got involved in it they got us involved in it   uhhuh   but kind of enjoyed it um dont always have time to to pick the phone up and participate
