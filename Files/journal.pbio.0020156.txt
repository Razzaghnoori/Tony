                                      This is the second in a series of three editorials that aim to address          recurring concerns about the benefits and risks associated with openaccess publishing in          medicine and the biological sciences                Scientific societies serve their members their broader scholarly communities and the        different components of their missions in many important ways Making peerreviewed        literature immediately accessible searchable and reusable to anyone in the world with an        Internet connection is a uniquely direct means of achieving a number of goals that are        common to most scholarly associations and of advancing the diverse interests of their        constituencies        Setting aside for the moment the question of how feasible it is for societies to alter        their journals access policies there is by now a broad consensus that widespread open        access to scientific publications is good for scientists and good for science Society        members want to maximize the impact of their workand articles that are freely available        online are cited more frequently than those that are not Lawrence  Most societies        are committed to catalyzing innovations within and across scientific disciplinesand        openaccess archives of fulltext literature provide a valuable tool for sharing        information globally in order to accelerate the rate of scientific progress Many societies        articulate in their mission statements the goal of communicating the benefits of their        members discoveries with the publicand openaccess publishing is a direct means to        accomplish this goal        In addition to an interest in exploring new ways to serve their members and their        missions societies have another compelling reason to investigate open access for their        journals the rapidly changing landscape of scholarly publishing From  to  the        average price of an academic journal subscription increased  per year Create Change         While societyrun and nonprofit journals may not be the major contributors to those        spiraling costs societies that rely on revenues from subscriptions and site licenses may        bear a disproportionate share of the negative consequences of skyrocketing serials prices        As libraries are forced for a variety of reasons including decreased budgets and the        increasing prevalence of big deals and journal bundling to eliminate subscriptions        society journals may be among the hardest hit Journals that appeal to a relatively        specialized readership and those that are not part of larger publishing groups are        particularly vulnerable to the contraction of serials collections that has already begun        and will likely accelerate Create Change                     A Society Is More Than a Journal        The confluence of forces in favor of open access says nothing about its fiscal        implications for scientific societies As any systemic change in research or publishing        would the movement toward open access has generated concern about its ramifications for        the scholarly associations that often serve as the backbones of scientific communities        However the strength of those societies and their essential role in the communities they        serve are precisely what should allay fears about the revenueeroding effect that some        argue would plague societies if they converted their traditional subscriptionbased        journals to open access        Scientific societies perform an array of tremendously valuable functions for their        constituents and disciplines Researchers educators and others join societies for the        many benefits of membership beyond simply discounted or free subscriptions to journals        so the concern that openaccess publications would be the death knell of voluntary academic        associations is misguided As Elizabeth Marincola executive director of the American        Society for Cell Biology recently noted her society offers a diverse range of products        so that if publications were at risk financially we wouldnt lose our membership base        because there are lots of other reasons why people are members Anonymous         While openaccess publication can in fact be paid for in a number of different ways        there is no question that a transition toward the elimination of online access barriers        requires most societies to restructure the business models for their journals If journal        subscriptions generate surplus revenue that supports other society activities then the        business model of the society as a whole may need to be examined This is not to say that        openaccess journals cannot generate a surplus or profitsimply that they do not do so by        restricting access to their primary research content                    Testing the OpenAccess Waters        There are a number of societies that have already begun to take transitional steps to        wean themselves from subscription revenues One of the earliest societies to commit to        openaccess publication the American Society for Clinical Investigation ASCI has since         provided the         Journal of Clinical Investigation JCI freely online and recently        reaffirmed its commitment to open access The financing having been resolved through        author charges and other means John Hawley the executive director of the ASCI writes        the         JCI hopefully can bring the greatest benefit to its authors and readers        regardless of who they might be It is in this spirit that the         JCI has always been free online and will remain so Hawley         In order to experiment cautiously with new access policies several societies have        implemented hybrid models of accessrestriction for their publications The American        Physiological Society for example offers authors in         Physiological Genomics the option to pay a surcharge for their articles        to be made freely available online immediately upon publication A recent survey by the        Joint Information Systems Committee JISC in the United Kingdom suggests that many authors        would use such an option if it were more widely available  of authors who had never        published in an openaccess journal and  of authors who had done so indicated that they        would be willing to pay a publisher of a journal sold according to the traditional        subscription model an additional fee for them to make the authors particular paper open        access JISC         JISC is also directly encouraging society and nonprofit publishers to implement hybrid        models and other openaccess experiments and to launch new openaccess journals by        providing grants to offset the publication charges for authors during this transitional        phase In the long run of course open access will prove sustainable when more funders of        research in addition to interested third parties designate funds specifically for the        costs of publishing articles to be made freely available searchable and reusable        online                    Starting the Dialogue        Reaching a steadystate system of openaccess publishing by scientific societies will        require three critical components recognition that open access serves societies members        and missions diversified revenue streams not solely dependent on subscription or        sitelicense fees and society publishers making use of recent innovations in journal        production and dissemination which can dramatically reduce the costs of publishing It is        after all the increased efficiencies born of new technologiesfrom the Internet itself to        electronic journal management systemsthat have made the idea of open access possible And        while proponents of open access are confident that publication charges of around  per        article will be sufficient to cover the costs of publishing an efficiently operated society        journal there is no question that many existing journals may need to update their        infrastructure in order to make open access financially viable PLoS         There is also no question that many societies do not at present have a wealth of        revenue streams beyond the proceeds from their journals which they often use to fund        valuable activities from education initiatives to annual meetings As openaccess journals        become more established however and as the benefits of open access to scientific and        medical literature become more apparent to society members the demand for the broadest        possible dissemination of research is only likely to grow Those societies that embrace the        developments taking place in scholarly publishing may well see their membership and        publications thrive more than societies that cling to the potentially unstable status        quo        In any case a constructive discussion about the pitfalls to be avoided and the benefits        to be gained through a transition to openaccess publishing would be a worthy first step        for any scientific society to takeand PLoS welcomes the questions comments and feedback        of those who are intrigued by the potential that open access affords and want to learn        more
