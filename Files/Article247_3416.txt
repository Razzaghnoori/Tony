 Giuliani Springsteen and Other Bosses ELLEN Still on the possible Hillary Clinton run for Senate in New York I m not sure why you think Nita Lowey should the first lady drop out would be the best Democratic candidate Perhaps she best represent your politics and those of many New Yorkers but she certainly doesn t have the juice to defeat Giuliani a politician who gives most people the creeps But that s why Giuliani will probably win People know he s mean that he grandstands that he s a control freak So he s somewhat immunized against such lapses in a campaign Lowey wouldn t stand a chance RFK Jr would win going away Andrew Cuomo would have an even shot Like the Clintons Ken Starr is a lame duck Any report he issues will have a two day news cycle life Starr whom I believe is a decent courageous man was one of Bill Clinton s victims He ended up as a zealot unprepared to deal with the likes of Sidney Blumenthal and James Carville He had a terrible sense of public relations and was demonized successfully by the Clinton spin machine However he wasn t Bill Clinton s last victim That honor goes to Al Gore I assume you won t be voting for George Bush do you prefer Gore or Bradley Or Warren Beatty You may be correct but where do you get your information that the stock market is shaky It certainly was last October with a recession looming but the rapid communications system in place today alerted the people who could do something about it unlike the recession of 90 91 Back to your old turf I don t know if you read the Times today but there was an unspeakably awful article by Neil Strauss about a Bruce Springsteen concert in the arts section As a woman who s written memorable rock criticism what do you think of today s reviewers Strauss worship of Springsteen was very hard to read Only at the end of the piece does he acknowledge the pop star s vast wealth but still gives him a bye He writes But at the same time he has gotten more than he wanted only to discover that a dream fulfilled is no longer a dream it is a new and heavier weight Yikes I ll bet the unemployed blue collar workers Springsteen sings about so mournfully would trade places with him in a second Best RUSS
