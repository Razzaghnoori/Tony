 Chicago Daily Law Bulletin Donald Hilliker Steps to the Fore at Legal Aid Organization Julia Brunts September 5 2002 Donald B Hilliker has his work cut out for him as much as 1 million worth Hilliker a long time member of the board for the Legal Assistance Foundation of Metropolitan Chicago has taken over as president of the organization Hilliker s term is one year and it happens to be the year in which the foundation anticipates large reductions in funding from several of its money sources Sheldon Roodman LAF executive director since 1976 said the foundation has an annual budget of about 12 million Of that about 6 4 million has in the past come from the Legal Services Corp the entity that disburses federal money for legal aid In the wake of the 2000 census which showed 35 000 fewer poor people in the state as well as a change in the distribution formula LAF expects to get 350 000 less from LSC starting next January Roodman said In addition he said several foundations that give money to the LAF have seen their endowments shrink with the declining stock market and the money available from the Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts program also has dwindled as interest rates have approached zero At the same time requests for services from the foundation which has the mission of providing free legal aid to poor people in order to make equal access to justice a reality have increased as the economy has softened We re caught in a vise here with more demand and less resources he said There is a real challenge for our board of directors to help us raise additional funds to help offset these losses and to help prevent reductions in staff and services to our clients He said Hilliker will be a good person to lead the organization through such an effort An LAF board member since the mid 80s Hilliker has been involved with legal aid in some way for his entire career Hilliker earned his law degree from Northwestern University School of Law and was admitted to practice in 1969 His first job was in legal services as a Reginald Heber Smith fellow Hilliker is now a complex litigation partner in McDermott Will Emery and chairman of the firm s Pro Bono Committee He said he s never lost interest in having lawyers do what they can to help those in need The central issue is that we are a society of laws and for that to truly work there must be equal access to the justice system for everyone whether they have the ability to pay or not he said Roodman said Hilliker is in an excellent position to help the foundation attract more private donors and recruit lawyers in private practice to volunteer their services I think Mr Hilliker brings extraordinary leadership to the organization he said Because of his many years of service on our board he knows its strengths and the importance of its work He will be good at getting the whole board to take a more active role in fund raising
