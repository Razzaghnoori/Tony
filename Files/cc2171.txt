 Introduction Each year approximately 750 000 patients in the USA suffer from sepsis Treatment for this disease costs 16 7 billion annually 1 Despite advances in supportive intensive care and use of appropriate antibiotics the mortality associated with sepsis remains high especially among those who develop hemodynamic shock 2 3 4 Such patients frequently progress to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome which results in a much higher mortality rate than among patients who do not develop such complications 3 5 6 7 This life threatening syndrome is largely attributed to the cardiovascular abnormalities associated with septic shock requiring supportive therapy e g mechanical ventilation fluid resuscitation and vasopressors with volume loading oxygen delivery and regional perfusion 8 However there are still many controversies regarding choice of fluids 9 10 11 12 vasopressors 13 14 15 hemodynamic end points for resuscitation 16 17 18 19 20 and monitoring techniques Findings from a national survey of intensive care unit ICU utilization showed differences in types of procedures performed between unit types and hospital sizes 21 The goals of the present study were to examine systematically the variations in overall resource use therapeutic modality use and outcome in patients with severe sepsis across academic medical centers and to evaluate relationships between therapeutic modality use and variation in resource use Methods Patient population All participating centers were members of the Academic Medical Center Consortium which sponsored the study All eight centers were large tertiary care academic medical centers with approximately 18 800 43 700 admissions annually 22 Patient enrollment occurred between January 1993 and April 1994 Patients surveyed represented a stratified random sample of patients in ICUs and outside ICUs for whom blood cultures were either positive or negative as previously described 22 Among non ICU patients with blood cultures that were negative at 48 hours sampling at all centers was fixed at 10 Among ICU patients and patients with a blood culture positive for a pathogen within 48 hours the fraction of patients sampled was established at each center and varied from 30 to 60 In addition all patients who died in an emergency department or an ICU and all patients who received a novel therapy for sepsis syndrome were surveyed The ICUs involved included both open and closed units Although previous reports included 1342 episodes of sepsis among 1166 unique patients with 1190 hospital admissions 22 23 the results presented here from the same database were based on the 1011 87 patients representing 1028 86 admissions with 1173 87 episodes of sepsis syndrome for whom billing information was available When patients had more than one episode in an admission only the first episode in that admission was evaluated Definitions Sepsis syndrome was defined as described by Sands and coworkers 22 using a modification of the criteria developed by Bone 24 and involved assessment of the presence of both screening criteria and confirmatory criteria for sepsis syndrome Either of the following were required for a patient to satisfy the screening criteria all four of temperature greater than 38 3 C or less than 35 6 C rectally respirations greater than 20 min or mechanical ventilation heart rate greater than 90 beats min and clinical evidence of infection or one or more blood cultures positive for a pathogen at 48 hours following admission Presence of any of the following seven features without an alternative cause was required for satisfaction of the confirmatory criteria ratio of partial arterial oxygen tension to inspired fractional oxygen below 280 intubated or 40 face mask in use nonintubated arterial pH below 7 30 urine output below 30 ml h systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg or a fall in systolic blood pressure by more than 40 mmHg sustained for 2 hours despite fluid challenge systemic vascular resistance below 800 dynes s cm 5 prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time greater than normal or platelets below 100 0 10 9 l or platelets decreased to less than 50 or most recent measurement before current day and documentation of deterioration in mental status within 24 hours In addition all patients who received a form of novel therapy for sepsis syndrome were enrolled in the sepsis syndrome group Because all patients with sepsis syndrome also meet the criteria for severe sepsis the term that is most popular now below we use the term severe sepsis Acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS was defined as partial arterial oxygen tension below 50 mmHg despite fractional inspired oxygen in excess of 50 and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates without signs of heart failure Disseminated intravascular coagulation DIC was defined as a positive D dimer or elevated fibrin degradation products plus a falling platelet count of 25 of less of baseline and elevation of either prothrombin time or partial prothrombin time or clinical evidence of bleeding Central nervous system CNS dysfunction was defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale score below 15 in patients with normal results at baseline neurologic examination or at least 1 point lower than baseline in patients with a previously abnormal examination result Renal failure was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of at least 2 0 mg dl during the sepsis episode if creatinine was below 1 5 mg dl at baseline or an absolute increase of 1 0 mg dl or more if baseline creatinine was at least 1 5 Liver failure was defined as present if total bilirubin was 2 0 mg dl or greater and either the alkaline phosphatase or a transaminase level was greater than twice normal in the absence of confounding disease Shock after onset of sepsis was defined as either at least 1 hour of decreased systolic blood pressure by at least 40 mmHg or systolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or less after adequate volume replacement and in the absence of antihypertensive agents or continuous infusion of pressors Uncontrolled hemorrhage was defined as active and live threatening bleeding requiring transfusions of more than 4 units within 24 hours of onset of sepsis Moderate or severe liver disease was defined as cirrhosis with portal hypertension or hepatic failure with coma or encephalopathy within the preceding 6 months Data collection Surveyors recorded the presence of all screening criteria for every day that a patient was a valid member of the surveillance group If screening criteria were met then the patient was enrolled as a case and detailed information including demographic historical clinical and laboratory data were abstracted from the medical record into a standardized data collection form for which all variables and criteria were defined Additional data including information on antibiotic use treatment modalities pulmonary artery catheter PAC use ventilator support pressor support albumin infusion het astarch and dextran complications ARDS renal failure liver failure DIC and shock and associated outcomes were abstracted 28 days after the first onset of severe sepsis or at the time of death or hospital discharge whichever came first Hospital length of stay LOS before and after the onset of severe sepsis and total hospital charge were obtained from the unified Academic Medical Center Consortium hospital billing database We calculated the patient s Charlson comorbidity score 25 a higher score reflects greater comorbidity We also obtained information on discharge diagnosis relative groups DRGs and DRG weight The current generation of DRGs was originally based on ICD 9 CM and takes into consideration operations complications and comorbidities Each DRG was preassigned an average LOS and reimbursement rate by the US Health Care Financing Administration The higher the DRG weight the higher the level of reimbursement Analyses Because the sampling fractions from different strata varied 22 individual cases carried different weight 23 and all calculations including means and proportions were performed using appropriate case weights We compared the proportion of sepsis patients receiving each intervention therapy and then the proportion with complications among eight academic centers using weighted 2statistics We also calculated the ratio of the highest to lowest proportion for each intervention and complication Multivariate comparisons were made using generalized linear modeling with post onset LOS and hospital charges as dependent variables and study center coded as dummy variables as the main covariate adjusting for age sex Charlson comorbidity score discharge DRG weight organ dysfunction ARDS uncontrolled hemorrhage moderate or severe liver disease or acute renal failure and service surgical versus medical at onset of sepsis The same adjustment of variables was applied in logistic regression models to compare the likelihood that a sepsis patient at a particular center received an intervention and experienced a complication arbitrarily choosing center 1 as the reference center Because patients within the same center could share some common characteristics generalized estimating equation regression models were used to perform the analyses on the comparisons of resource use between patients with and without use of modalities The r 2value was calculated for each model All analyses were performed using the SAS statistical package SAS Institute Inc Cary NC USA 26 Results Variation in resource use There was significant variation in mean total charges among admissions with severe sepsis among the study centers varying from 65 162 median 42 802 to 244 293 median 181 758 Table 2 The mean post onset LOS varied from 16 1 days to 24 8 days median range 9 16 days among centers Other measures of resource utilization including total LOS and LOS in the ICU were also significantly different across centers with means of 22 7 36 9 days and 5 0 17 8 days respectively After adjusting for age sex Charlson comorbidity score discharge DRG weight organ dysfunction and service at onset of sepsis the variations in mean total charges and post onset LOS remained significant ranging from 69 429 9562 to 237 898 12 129 and from 15 9 2 0 days to 24 2 1 8 days respectively Table 3 Variation in therapeutic modality use Interventions used frequently after the onset of severe sepsis included PACs 19 4 ventilator support 21 8 pressor support 45 8 and albumin infusion 14 4 Table 4 Although there were variations across medical centers for each therapeutic modality variation profiles differed substantially among the modalities Modalities with moderate variation profiles among the eight participating centers included PACs varied 4 0 fold 95 confidence interval CI of 2 6 fold to 6 4 fold range 8 7 to 35 1 ventilator support varied 3 2 fold 95 CI 2 1 fold to 4 9 fold range 11 5 to 36 4 and albumin infusion within 24 hours after sepsis onset varied 4 9 fold 95 CI 2 2 fold to 10 9 fold range 6 0 to 29 1 In contrast use of pressor support varied only 1 9 fold 95 CI 1 4 fold to 2 6 fold across centers ranging from 31 4 to 60 4 and antibiotics given within 24 hours after onset had the least variation of 1 1 fold 95 CI 1 0 fold to 1 1 fold and ranging from 87 0 to 98 5 Use of hetastarch and use of dextran within 24 hours after onset in sepsis patients were the least common therapeutic modalities among the eight centers with ranges of 0 6 8 and 0 6 2 respectively Of patients receiving pressors within 24 hours after sepsis onset 28 3 received low dose dopamine only 5 g kg per min the proportion varied 7 fold 95 CI 2 4 fold to 20 8 fold across centers ranging from 6 4 in center 5 to 44 8 in center 1 data not shown The results of models adjusting for age sex Charlson comorbidity score discharge DRG weight organ dysfunction and service at onset of sepsis are shown in Fig 1 Centers that had rates significantly higher than the reference center were centers 3 4 5 6 and 8 for PAC use centers 2 3 4 5 and 8 for ventilator support center 7 for pressor support and centers 2 7 and 8 for albumin infusion In contrast significantly lower rates for antibiotic use within 24 hours after onset were identified in centers 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 Variation in outcomes Among all patients with severe sepsis frequent complications included shock 45 4 renal failure 19 7 CNS dysfunction 18 9 liver failure 12 2 DIC 10 3 ARDS 9 1 and death 30 0 within 28 days after sepsis onset Table 5 There was significant variation in each type of complication across the eight centers with ranges of 23 9 70 0 for shock 9 5 35 0 for renal failure 0 3 37 5 for CNS dysfunction 4 1 27 9 for liver failure 5 5 15 0 for DIC 2 8 21 8 for ARDS and 19 3 49 1 for 28 day mortality rate Figure 2shows the results of differences in rates of sepsis complications adjusted for age sex Charlson comorbidity score discharge DRG weight organ dysfunction and service at onset of sepsis Analysis of the 28 day in hospital adjusted mortality rates revealed 3 fold variability among centers Compared with the reference center higher rates were found for ARDS among one center C8 for renal failure among five centers C3 C4 C5 C7 and C8 for liver failure among one center C4 for shock among six centers C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 and C8 and for 28 day mortality among four centers C3 C6 C7 and C8 Also a significant inverse correlation was seen between antibiotic use within 24 hours after onset of episode and the 28 day mortality rates r 2 0 72 P 0 01 Fig 3 This correlation remained significant even after excluding patients with do not resuscitate orders r 2 0 63 P 0 02 Significant associations were not found between 28 day mortality and the use of other modalities across the eight centers data not shown Relation between resource use and modalities Comparisons of resource use among patients treated with specific modalities and those who were not showed that administration of antibiotics within 24 hours after sepsis onset had no impact on any of the LOS categories but was associated with total and daily hospital charges Table 6 Use of other modalities including albumin infusion was associated with increased resource use for daily hospital charges Total hospital charges and LOS in the ICU were significantly higher among patients who were given pressor support and or albumin infusion after onset of sepsis as compared with those who were not Increased post onset LOS and LOS in the ICU were associated with use of PACs No associations were found between total LOS and the modalities studied Discussion Overall we found moderate variation in resource and therapeutic modality use among patients with severe sepsis in academic centers In general this variation had little relationship to clinical outcomes although clinical outcomes varied substantially between the centers The exception is that even adjusting for potential confounders early antibiotic therapy was associated with a lower 28 day mortality rate Increased use of some of the therapeutic modalities was associated with greater resource utilization Prior studies have shown variability in the use of therapeutic modalities including PACs ventilator and intravenous vasoactive and inotropic agents among ICU patients 21 27 and different impacts on outcomes and use of hospital resources associated with these treatments 16 17 18 28 29 In general with the exception of the recent trial demonstrating benefit of early goal directed treatment involving oxygenation including ventilatory support if necessary and blood pressure including intravenous pressors if necessary 30 few data are available that demonstrate that these modalities improve outcomes Colloids and crystalloid are equally effective in restoring tissue perfusion in patients with septic shock 31 However the choice of fluid has considerable cost implications colloids cost more for volume replacement Largely inappropriate use of colloids was found in a survey of academic health centers despite guidelines from a US hospital consortium recommending that colloids be used in hemorrhagic shock only until blood products become available and in nonhemorrhagic shock only if an initial infusion with crystalloid is insufficient 32 33 A recent systematic review of randomized controlled trials comparing colloids and crystalloid solutions for volume replacement found that resuscitation with colloids in critically ill patients was actually associated with an increased risk of mortality 10 In addition vasopressors have been recommended to achieve end points of hemodynamic and normal or supranormal oxygen transport variables in sepsis patients who remain hypotensive despite adequate volume therapy However after reviewing the literature on the use of vasopressors in patients with sepsis syndrome Rudis and colleagues 13 found that catecholamine therapy resulting in increased hemodynamic and oxygen transport measures did not change the overall mortality with the exception of two instances in which epinephrine adrenaline and norepinephrine noradrenaline were given alone after volume repletion The results from a recent trial of low dose dopamine in critically ill patients who had systemic inflammatory response syndrome and were at risk for renal failure did not show benefit in renal protection and survival from the treatment 34 However a very recent trial of early goal directed therapy in treatment of sepsis did demonstrate substantial improvement in outcome 30 Another technology is monitoring central pressures by PAC which is often used in ICUs to assess the effect of pharmacotherapy on the cardiac index in patients with septic shock This is done even though the efficacy of the PAC has never been demonstrated convincingly in a large randomized controlled trial A number of randomized controlled trials have examined the effectiveness of PACs or PAC guided strategies in sepsis patients 16 17 18 19 20 35 36 and other specific patient groups 29 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 with conflicting results A recent case mix adjusted observational study of a large sample of ICU patients found that PAC use was associated with increased risk for mortality and resource use 28 Mechanical ventilation in patients with ARDS has been reported to be associated with pneumonia and lung injury 44 45 46 47 Properly constructed trials are still needed to define the best use of mechanical ventilation in sepsis although early ventilatory support was a component of the recent early goal directed intervention by Rivers and coworkers 30 Use of some therapeutic modalities does appear correlated with organizational characteristics For example results from a national ICU survey conducted by Greoger and colleagues 21 showed that more technologies were used in surgical units as compared with other units as well as in larger versus smaller hospitals and in university affiliated facilities In addition a large prospective multicenter study evaluated the differences in ICU characteristics and performance among teaching and nonteaching hospitals 48 The results of that study revealed more frequent use of monitoring and therapeutic interventions and greater resource utilization in teaching hospital ICUs Also a recent report from a large retrospective database study of ICU patients 27 confirmed that organizational characteristics of ICUs were associated with variation in PAC use In addition that report indicated that economic incentives and insurance coverage as well as clinical variables were associated with PAC use Similarly much of the variation in resource use and modality use across centers in the present study may not be due to patient related factors but rather to organizational factors and physician beliefs We did find a number of relationships between modality use and resource utilization In particular there were associations between LOS in the ICU and use of PACs pressor support and albumin infusion These may probably be accounted for in part by the fact that patients with longer LOS in the ICU were more likely to be treated with supportive technologies In general however modalities with higher variation profiles reflect areas of greater disagreement in terms of treatment decision making Such areas may be fertile for additional investigation It is striking that delay in antibiotic therapy was associated with a higher mortality rate and that some delays were present in this very ill population Delays are common in American medicine 49 even in urgent situations such as treatment of life threatening laboratory abnormalities 50 Although we do not know the causes of delays in antibiotic initiation they appeared more common in some institutions than in others We speculate that some may have occurred because of problems related to crowding for example emergency rooms or ICUs might have been full resulting in delayed transfer or the clinical importance of changes in vital signs might not have been recognized Approaches such as protocols for early recognition and treatment of severe sepsis and facilitation of medication orders that are really needed urgently may be helpful Guidelines for the management of severe sepsis are probably most applicable for certain treatment modalities such as PACs albumin dextran and hetastarch Even use of organ failure treatment modalities such as ventilator support and renal replacement therapies might be different if such guidelines were developed An important underlying issue is why variation occurs 51 52 It should not be surprising that it is present in this domain because the pioneering work of Wennberg 52 identified variation across a broad array of domains One of the major causes of variation is probably physician uncertainty regarding what interventions are truly beneficial and clinician beliefs where training occurred and regional practices probably also play roles Uncertainty may be especially problematic in conditions such as sepsis in which mortality is high and clinicians strongly want to do everything possible Variation is likely to diminish as more evidence becomes available and is brought to the point of care Analysis of variation can be very useful for identifying areas of high uncertainty 52 This study has a number of limitations We had information only on hospital charges rather than hospital costs We did not have information on organizational variables such as organizational setting staffing or leadership of practices and the study included only academic centers Also our data did not include the indications for use of therapeutic modalities In conclusion significant variations were present in hospital resource use and patient outcome among sepsis patients across eight academic medical centers In general variation in therapeutic modality use did not correlate with clinical outcomes suggesting that some use of these modalities may be of limited value and that further evaluation of these modalities is warranted The exception was that delay in giving antibiotics to sepsis patients was associated with a higher 28 day mortality rate Approaches to eliminate these delays may improve outcomes Competing interests None declared Key messages Moderate variation in resource use and use of technologies was present in treatment of severe sepsis among academic centers This variation presisted even after adjusting for potential confounders Increased use of some therapeutic modalities such as albumin infusion was associated with greater resource utilization Among therapeutic modalities only early antibiotic use was associated with lower 28 day mortality Taken together these data suggest that some therapeutic modalities may be of limited value in sepsis treatment and that further evaluation is warranted Abbreviations ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome CI confidence interval CNS central
