 In this issue of PLoS Biology Hebert et al 2004 have set out to test the resolution and performance of DNA barcoding using a single mtDNA gene cytochrome c oxidase I COI for a sample of North American birds Before turning to details of this study it is useful as context to consider the following questions What is DNA barcoding and what does it promise What is new about it Why is it controversial What are the potential pitfalls Put simply the intent of DNA barcoding is to use large scale screening of one or a few reference genes in order to i assign unknown individuals to species and ii enhance discovery of new species Hebert et al 2003 Stoeckle 2003 Proponents envisage development of a comprehensive database of sequences preferably associated with voucher specimens representing described species against which sequences from sampled individuals can be compared Given the long history of use of molecular markers e g allozymes rDNA and mtDNA for these purposes Avise 2004 there is nothing fundamentally new in the DNA barcoding concept except increased scale and proposed standardization The former is inevitable Standardization i e the selection of one or more reference genes is of proven value in the microbial community and in stimulating large scale phylogenetic analyses but whether one gene fits all is open to debate Why then all the fuss Initial reactions to the DNA barcoding concept have ranged from unbridled enthusiasm especially from ecologists Janzen 2004 to outright condemnation largely from taxonomists e g see the February 2003 issue of Trends in Ecology and Evolution The former view reflects a real need to connect different life history stages and to increase the precision and efficiency of field studies involving diverse and difficult to identify taxa The criticisms are mainly in response to the view that single gene sequences should be the primary identifier for species DNA taxonomy Tautz et al 2002 see also Blaxter 2004 At least for the macrobiota the DNA barcoding community has moved away from this to emphasize the importance of embedding any large scale sequence database within the existing framework and practice of systematics including the importance of voucher specimens and of integrating molecular with morphological characters Another point of contention that DNA barcodes have limited phylogenetic resolution arises from confusion about the scope of inference At best single gene assays can hope to identify an individual to species or reveal inconsistencies between molecular variation and current perceptions of species boundaries DNA barcoding should not be confused with efforts to resolve the tree of life It should connect with and benefit from such projects but resolving phylogeny at scales from species to major eukaryotic clades requires a very different strategy for selecting genes Indeed the very characteristic that makes the COI gene a candidate for high throughput DNA barcoding highly constrained amino acid sequence and thus broad applicability of primers Hebert et al 2003 also limits its information content at deeper phylogenetic levels e g Russo et al 1996 Zardoya and Meyer 1996 Naylor and Brown 1997 Finally while superficially appealing the very term DNA barcoding is unfortunate as it implies that each species has a fixed and invariant characteristic like a barcode on a supermarket product As evolutionary biologists we should question this analogy In evaluating the promise and pitfalls of DNA barcoding we need to separate the two areas of application molecular diagnostics of individuals relative to described taxa and DNA led discovery of new species Both are inherently phylogenetic and rely on a solid taxonomic foundation including adequate sampling of variation within species and inclusion of all previously described extant species within a given genus Accurate diagnosis depends on low intraspecific variation compared with that between species such that a short DNA sequence will allow precise allocation of an individual to a described taxon The extensive literature on mtDNA phylogeography Avise 2000 indicates that this condition often holds although there are exceptions Furthermore within many species there is sufficient structure that it will be possible to allocate an individual to a particular geographic population Such identifications should be accompanied by a statement of confidence e g node support in a phylogenetic analysis and caveats in relation to the breath of sampling in the reference database e g whale forensics Palumbi and Cipriano 1998 DNA led species discovery is more contentious but again is not new In animals inclusion of mtDNA evidence in biogeographic and systematic analyses often reveals unexpected diversity or discordance with morphology which then prompts re evaluation of morphological and ecological characteristics and if warranted taxonomic revision But despite recent proposals Wiens and Penkrot 2002 Hebert et al 2004 it does not follow that mtDNA divergence should be a primary criterion for recognizing species boundaries see also Sites and Marshall 2003 Potential limitations of using mtDNA to infer species boundaries include retention of ancestral polymorphism male biased gene flow selection on any mtDNA nucleotide as the whole genome is one linkage group introgression following hybridization and paralogy resulting from transfer of mtDNA gene copies to the nucleus These are acknowledged by Hebert et al 2004 and well documented in the literature Bensasson et al 2001 Ballard and Whitlock 2004 including that on birds Degnan 1993 Quinn and White 1987 Lovette and Bermingham 2001 Weckstein et al 2001 More specifically using some level of mtDNA divergence as a yardstick for species boundaries ignores the low precision with which coalescence of mtDNA predicts phylogenetic divergence at nuclear genes Hudson and Turelli 2003 An additional problem with focusing on mtDNA or any other molecular divergence as a primary criterion for recognizing species is that it will lead us to overlook new or rapidly diverged species such as might arise through divergent selection or polyploidy and thus to conclude that speciation requires long term isolation For example a recent mtDNA analysis of North American birds Johnson and Cicero 2004 showed that numerous avian species have low divergences and that speciation can occur relatively rapidly under certain circumstances We contend therefore that whereas divergent or discordant mtDNA sequences might stimulate taxonomic reassessment based on nuclear genes as well as morphology ecology or behavior mtDNA divergence is neither necessary nor sufficient as a criterion for delineating species This view accords with existing practice taxonomic splits in North American birds typically are based on multiple lines of biological evidence e g morphological and vocal differences as well as genetic data American Ornithologists Union 1998 We turn now to the core of Hebert et al s paper COI sequencing of a substantial sample of North American birds 260 of 667 species and its validity as a test of the barcoding concept Their aim is to test the correspondence between species boundaries signaled by COI barcodes and those established by prior taxonomic research North American birds are an interesting choice because their species level taxonomy is relatively well resolved and there has been extensive previous analysis of levels of mtDNA sequence divergence within and among described species Klicka and Zink 1997 Avise and Walker 1998 Johnson and Cicero 2004 Herbert et al 2004 found differences in COI sequences between closely related species that were 19 24 times greater in magnitude than the differences within species 7 05 7 93 versus 0 27 0 43 respectively From these data they conclude that most North American bird species can be discriminated via molecular diagnosis of individuals and propose a standard sequence threshold of ten times the mean intraspecific variation yielding a 2 7 threshold in birds to flag genetically divergent taxa as provisional species Thus their analysis seeks to address both potential applications of DNA barcoding Although Herbert et al sampled a large number of species a true test of the precision of mtDNA barcodes to assign individuals to species would include comparisons with sister species the most closely related extant relatives This would require that all members of a genus be examined rather than a random sample of imprecisely defined close relatives and that taxa be included from more than one geographic region Johnson and Cicero 2004 showed the importance of comparing sister species when examining genetic divergence values in North American birds with results that contrast strongly with those of Hebert et al as well as previous studies e g Klicka and Zink 1997 For 39 pairs of avian sister species mtDNA sequence divergences ranged from 0 0 to 8 2 with an average of 1 9 cf 7 to 8 among closely related species in Hebert et al Of these 29 pairs 74 are at or below the 2 7 threshold proposed by Herbert et al and thus would not be recognized as species despite biological differences Moreover although only a few of these 39 pairs see Table 1 in Johnson and Cicero 2004 had sufficient sampling to assess intraspecific variation in mtDNA sequences these typically showed paraphyly in mtDNA haplotypes Therefore there are still too few cases with adequate sampling of intraspecific diversity for sister species pairs to know how common paraphyly is although a recent meta analysis found that 17 of bird species deviated from mtDNA monophyly Funk and Omland 2003 Collectively these observations cast doubt on the precision of DNA barcoding for allocating individuals to previously described avian species Empidonax flycatchers which are renowned for their morphological similarity and could thereby benefit from DNA based identification tools provide an example of the importance of a more detailed analysis A complete molecular phylogeny for this group Johnson and Cicero 2002 yielded distances between four pairs of sister species that ranged from 0 7 E difficilis versus E occidentalis to 4 6 E traillii versus E alnorum notably the genetic distance between mainland and island populations of E difficilis E d difficilis and E d insulicola 0 9 was greater than that between sister species Johnson and Cicero 2002 Herbert et al s analysis included only two species of Empidonax E traillii and E virescens which are not sisters but members of divergent clades Because E virescens is genetically distant from all other species of Empidonax 10 3 to 12 5 uncorrected distance Johnson and Cicero 2002 its comparison with E trailli therefore inflates estimates of interspecific distances within the genus Another key point of Hebert et al s analysis was to estimate levels of intraspecific diversity For 130 species of the 260 examined more than two individuals were sequenced n 2 to 12 individuals per species mean 2 4 and pooled pairwise genetic distances were found to be uncorrelated with geographic distances leading Hebert et al to conclude that high levels of intraspecific divergence in COI in North American birds appear uncommon However this makes the assumption that there is a common underlying pattern of phylogeographic structure which is unlikely for North American birds Zink 1996 Zink et al 2001 If there is significant variation assessment of intraspecific diversity can be based on a small sample of individuals only if individuals are sampled across existing population subdivisions for which geography and phenotypic variation are reasonable initial surrogates The analyses presented by Hebert et al will certainly stimulate further debate a reply by Hebert et al to the present letter is posted at http www barcodinglife com but for the reasons outlined here they are not yet a definitive test of the utility of DNA barcoding for either diagnosis of individuals or discovery of species We also question whether the results for North American birds can be extrapolated to the tropics where DNA barcoding could have maximum value In general among population sequence divergence increases with decreasing latitude even excluding previously glaciated regions Martin and MacKay 2004 and studies of intraspecific genetic diversity in Neotropical birds have revealed a higher level of phylogeographic subdivision compared to temperate species Remsen 1997 Lovette and Bermingham 2001 Thus the general utility of mtDNA barcoding across different biogeographic regions and between resident versus migratory taxa requires further scrutiny There is little doubt that large scale and standardized sequencing when integrated with existing taxonomic practice can contribute significantly to the challenges of identifying individuals and increasing the rate of discovering biological diversity But to determine when and where this approach is applicable we now need to discover the boundary conditions The real challenge lies with tropical taxa and those with limited dispersal and thus substantial phylogeographic structure Such analyses need to be taxonomically broad and need to extend beyond the focal geographic region to ensure that potential sister taxa are evaluated and can be discriminated There is also the need to examine groups with frequent possibly cryptic hybridization recent radiations and high rates of gene transfer from mtDNA to the nucleus Only then will the skeptics be satisfied
