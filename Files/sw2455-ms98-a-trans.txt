        well i wondered if i was going to get to talk to a male or a female on this topic   have you been talking to males yeah yeah this is this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female   i was afraid we might get into an argument  well uh     right   i guess uh there have been certainly a lot of changes in the last couple of generations for uh the roles of women   umhum   and uh i guess the most significant probably is that so many are working now and trying to juggle   right   job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities you know they may be going to school or may have elderly parents or you know all sorts of other things   yeah it it seems too me like though womens roles are changing faster than the men and therefore the women are spreading themselves thinner   oh i think so   than before   absolutely i i i think its extremely difficult to keep up with all that uh we have to these days   umhum   sometimes i think i am going crazy trying to do it but   do you work outside the home   yes   do you have children   uh yes they are getting older now so they are not quite as much of a responsibility but they are still there you know they still take time and   uhhuh oh sure   and i you know i still provide most of the the things that go on around the house   right   so uh yeah and for a while i was going to school to and that it was tough   yeah i uh i think that while its a good change for i think women to be able to fulfill their potential in whatever they feel you know their expertise may be uh i think sometimes other things suffer and that i think its hard to find a balance there   umhum but in some ways i think we are expected to do it all youre almost looked down upon if you dont try to do all of these things and thats where the problem is really   right yeah yeah i have little children four and one and i decided that it was very important to me to stay home um and   uhhuh   when i i i happen to you know be im very active with uh people other people with children my age and most of us do tend to stay home but when i run into people that you know just have recently had had babies or have very young children and are working full time i theres almost a uh friction between us   uhhuh   um not people that are you know necessarily good friends even though that has happened too uh it its almost as though it puts you on different sides of a fence you know when if you decide to go back to work then   yeah   you feel like you are always having to defend yourself and and if you dont then sometimes you feel like youre looked down upon by people that go back to work and so youre just wasting your time at home   right yeah yeah its a tough one i mean ive done some of both i when my kids were real little i was at home for a couple of different periods of time oh i think the longest was less than a year but still   umhum umhum   at least i was able to to spend you know those first months with them   right   but uh i mostly went back to work because i was tired of doing without things  you know the money was the issue   yeah   but uh even now i would i would like to not have to work in some ways it its a kind of pull and tug on the other hand   right yeah   i cant imagine just being at home uh although i have a lot of interests and a lot of things i would like to pursue   uhhuh   uh still uh theres theres sort of a feeling of accomplishment with having you know a job and all that goes with that   no that thats definitely true in fact i i work out of my home um im an accountant and i do taxes and bookkeeping and   oh   i uh it it was its a way for me to stay home   umhum   and i mean i still unfortunately have to be very disciplined in in doing my work at five in the morning and ten oclock at night but   yeah   uh but but it its worked out for for my family uh to have my cake and eat it too kind of thing   yeah yeah thats a good deal where do you think this is going in the future i mean do you think things are going to change or are we going to keep having to try to juggle all of this   well i i i hope that they will change uh but but im i just i know its going to be a slow change uh i i feel as though a lot of people are going back to just having a one wage earner i mean im just thinking of my circle of people that i know i know quite a few people who have decided to not have both both uh couples you know both uh of the parents work and yet um   yeah   i i well i hope to see employer based you know helping out you know child uh care centers at the place of employment and and things like that that will help out   umhum   what do you think do you think were setting a trend here or   i dont yeah i well i see i think some people wanting to stay home more and take care of the children uh and even those who may not do it seem to be   umhum   spending more time with their kids and really trying harder at making all of the the family things work   right   uh but i dont know if theyre going to ever give up their careers you know Its sort of like they went to school and they worked so hard to get where they are i dont know if they want to completely give that up   right it is a very personal thing   but it would be nice if there could be an inbetween a middle ground somewhere   yeah i think its hard though when you talk about about families and and raising children because children i think children have a hard time understanding a middle ground i think they uh they need security and yet they i dont know i from speaking from my children they they arent real flexible when it comes to things like that   yeah   they uh they they want to know things are going to be a certain way   well yeah i think they they like a routine of sorts   umhum right well well see i im hoping to see more female leadership in in our society   well yes i i like the fact that you know gradually youre beginning to see women in public office and executive positions but its still a long way from being what it ought to be   oh yes and the the numbers are still very skewed to say the least   yeah okay well i enjoyed talking to you all right goodbye   okay you too Ellen byebye
