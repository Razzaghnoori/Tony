 Introduction NO which may be synthesized by any of the three isoforms of NOS is a vasodilator of the pulmonary circulation in many mammals NO has been proposed as a modulator of vascular tone and structure in the pulmonary circulation and previous studies using NOS inhibitors 1 2 suggested that inhibition of NO increases acute hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction Chronic NOS inhibition did not lead to development of pulmonary hypertension 3 however possibly because of a decrease in cardiac output These discrepancies have been addressed in recent studies using mice that are deficient in NOS isoforms Three isoforms of NOS are found in the lung The principle isoform that is found in the pulmonary vasculature is eNOS 4 iNOS is expressed in airway epithelium and airway and vascular smooth muscle 5 6 whereas nNOS is expressed in the bronchial epithelium and lung nervous tissue 4 5 7 8 Thus all three NOS isoforms could contribute to modulation of pulmonary vascular tone Studies using knockout mice for each of these isoforms 9 10 11 12 suggest that eNOS derived NO is important in modulating basal pulmonary vascular tone as well as in attenuating the development of pulmonary hypertension Severe sustained hypoxia causes pulmonary hypertension in many animals Upregulation of all three NOS isoforms following severe hypoxia has been reported in rats 4 13 14 15 16 Less is certain about the expression of NOS in the murine lung following hypoxia with previous reports 17 18 suggesting an increase in lung eNOS and iNOS levels We therefore hypothesized that NOS isoforms are upregulated following hypoxia and that this may account for the increased susceptibility to hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in mice that lack eNOS 9 12 In the present study we exposed wild type mice to severe hypobaric hypoxia from birth and measured NOS mRNA and protein levels We then compared the findings with localization of NOS protein in the lung as assessed using immunohistochemistry Materials

Measurements of pulmonary hypertension RVsP was measured as an index of pulmonary arterial pressure As shown in Fig 1 RVsP was elevated in animals that were exposed to hypobaric hypoxia as compared with those that were exposed to sea level and ambient conditions Hypoxic animals were also more polycythemic than were normoxic animals 70 4 in hypoxic animals versus 45 3 and 42 3 for animal subjected to sea level and ambient conditions respectively P 0 001 Western blotting As shown in Fig 2 lung eNOS protein levels were increased following hypoxia with a trend toward increased eNOS in ambient versus sea level conditions However iNOS protein was below the limit of detection following any level of hypoxic exposure positive control was lipopolysaccharide treated mouse spleen and using several different antibodies Affinity Bioreagents and BD Transduction Laboratories Affinity Bioreagents blot shown and nNOS was unchanged among the three experimental groups positive control was mouse brain Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction eNOS expression in the lung as studied using quantitative reverse transcription PCR was increased 1 5 fold following hypoxia as compared with normoxic conditions whereas iNOS expression was increased 3 5 fold Fig 3 Immunohistochemistry Localization of NOS in mouse lung was determined using antibodies specific for eNOS iNOS and nNOS Fig 4 eNOS levels were increased following hypoxia and the staining was more intense in large vessels and extended out to the periphery of the lung and was also found in smaller vessels In contrast iNOS and nNOS were limited primarily to the airway epithelium and their levels did not increase following exposure to hypoxia This was confirmed using quantitative image analysis data not shown Nitric oxide metabolites To determine whether the increase in NOS in the pulmonary circulation following hypoxia resulted in increased NO we measured plasma NO metabolites Fig 5 There was a modest increase in levels of NO metabolites in animals exposed to hypoxia as compared with sea level or ambient conditions Discussion The major finding of this work was the upregulation of lung expression of eNOS and possibly iNOS in mice with severe hypoxia induced pulmonary hypertension The increased eNOS was correlated with increased immunolocalization to the periphery of the lung This however was not observed for iNOS or nNOS Additionally we found increased severity of pulmonary hypertension in animals exposed to hypoxia during postnatal development The pulmonary hypertension in mice exposed to hypoxia from birth was more severe than we had observed in previous studies of 4 weeks of hypoxia in mature animals 9 The degree of polycythemia was also greater in these animals than in previous reports and might have contributed to the increase in pulmonary pressure due to increased viscosity 19 This suggests that either the duration of hypoxic exposure or exposure from neonatal life provided additional physiologic stress that was not seen in more mature animals 9 No animals died however suggesting that the stress was not sufficiently severe to decrease survival during the study period This observation of increased susceptibility to hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in younger developing animals is in agreement with previous reports 20 21 The increase in eNOS protein and mRNA levels and the peripheral immunolocalization is in accord with previous reports 13 14 18 LeCras et al 13 found that the amount of eNOS protein was increased in hypoxic hypertensive rat lungs and that this was not entirely due to the presence of hypertension and increased shear stress but was also due to hypoxia This is further supported by Tyler et al 15 who found that eNOS protein levels were increased in rats with hypoxic pulmonary hypertension but not in those with chemical induced monocrotaline or genetic fawn hooded rat pulmonary hypertension 15 As in the present study increased eNOS levels correlated with de novo expression in the small resistance vessels in the lung 14 18 The mechanism by which hypoxia increases eNOS expression is poorly understood because a hypoxia responsive element has not yet been identified in the eNOS promoter Recently altering the redox state of pulmonary artery endothelial cells in culture suggested that activation of redox sensitive transcription factor activator protein 1 during hypoxia may be responsible for the increase in eNOS expression 22 Despite the increase in eNOS however the mice developed severe pulmonary hypertension this suggests either that NO production was not increased see below or that NO was consumed Under more physiologically relevant levels of hypoxia the central role of eNOS in protecting against hypertension is supported by our observation that loss of eNOS leads to increased acute hypoxic vasoconstriction and development of pulmonary hypertension 9 10 11 12 In contrast to the observations with eNOS iNOS message was increased but iNOS protein remained below the limit of detection in the lungs of hypoxic hypertensive mice Previously LeCras et al 14 reported an increase in both iNOS mRNA and protein levels in rat lungs following hypoxia In the present study however the increase in iNOS mRNA levels was not associated with detectable iNOS protein using several different antibodies in mice This is in contrast to the study of Quinlan et al 17 in which increased lung iNOS protein levels in adult mice following hypoxia was reported This discrepancy may be due to differences between the present study and that report Specifically animals in our experiments are a different strain and were housed in sealed hypobaric chambers as opposed to being flushed with 10 O 2 gas The hypobaric chambers used in the present study have a higher rate of air exchange than other hypoxic gas chambers thus limiting the build up of waste products including ammonia that may contribute to lung inflammation and induction of iNOS as the combination of hypoxia and inflammation has previously been reported to increase iNOS expression 23 Thus the increased iNOS reported previously may be due to the combination of hypoxia and inflammation 23 Others have also reported that lung iNOS protein was detectable only after lipopolysaccharide administration 24 The iNOS promoter contains a hypoxia responsive element and the increase in iNOS transcription in hypoxia may be due to the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 1 25 26 27 Additionally recent studies also suggest that alterations in redox state during hypoxia may also increase iNOS expression similar to eNOS by activation of redox sensitive nuclear factor B or activator protein 1 28 29 It is not known whether hypoxia interferes with translation or degradation of iNOS protein In support of our current finding however immunohistochemical localization of iNOS to the airway did not change following hypoxia We have recently reported that mice deficient in iNOS do not have increased pulmonary vasoreactivity suggesting that lung derived iNOS is not an important modulator of acute pulmonary vascular reactivity 10 Mice deficient in iNOS do have a slight increase in right ventricular pressure however suggesting that iNOS especially in the upper airway may contribute to modulation of chronic pulmonary vascular tone 10 Thus the importance of iNOS in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension remains uncertain In rat lungs nNOS expression was increased following hypoxia 4 but we did not find an increase in lung nNOS in mice following hypoxia Increased nNOS has been suggested as a compensatory vasodilator in the cerebral and coronary circulation of eNOS deficient mice but its role in the pulmonary circulation is unknown 8 30 However we previously demonstrated 10 that nNOS does not appear to play a role in modulating tone in the pulmonary circulation Although we did not look at the expression of NOS in other rat vascular beds following hypoxia other reports suggest that the increase in NOS following hypoxia may be species and tissue specific Previous studies of NOS expression in systemic and pulmonary endothelial cells from different species in cultures 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 have yielded conflicting results Recently Toporsian et al 38 reported in vivo downregulation of eNOS mRNA and protein levels in the aorta of rats following prolonged hypoxia which correlated with impaired endothelium dependent vasorelaxation whereas there was an increase in eNOS protein levels in the lungs Conversely eNOS levels were increased in hypoxic uterine but not femoral or renal arteries of pregnant sheep 39 Whether increased NOS expression leads to increased production of NO in vivo is controversial 40 In piglets in vivo acute hypoxia caused decreased exhaled NO and decreased aortic and pulmonary arterial plasma nitrite levels 41 Following chronic hypoxia in rats Sato et al 42 found that plasma NO metabolite levels were markedly increased compared with normoxic controls when animals were exposed to 21 O 2 but were not increased when rats were breathing 10 O 2 This suggests that hypoxia inhibited NO production despite the increase in NOS expression There are several proposed mechanisms for the discordance between NO production and increased NOS expression in vitro and in vivo including impaired arginine uptake 43 decreased heat shock protein 90 levels 44 and decreased O 2 tension 42 40 In agreement with previous studies the plasma NO metabolite content in the present study was minimally elevated in the hypoxic group Although we attempted to keep the mice continuously hypoxic a relatively brief period of reoxygenation might account for the slight increase in plasma NO metabolites seen in the hypoxic animals which is consistent with the observations of Sato et al 42 Because the systemic and pulmonary vasculatures can both contribute to plasma NO metabolite levels if NOS was downregulated in the systemic circulation as suggested by Toporsian et al 38 then the lack of increased NO metabolites could also be due to decreased NOS activity in the systemic circulation However those investigators did not observe any difference in plasma NO metabolites in normoxic versus hypoxic rats in which aortic NOS was downregulated but did observe a decrease in acetylcholine stimulated NO release from aortic rings The pattern of NOS expression in vascular beds other than the lung following hypoxia in mice is presently unknown Conclusion In summary we identified a unique pattern of NOS upregulation in the murine lung with severe hypoxia induced pulmonary hypertension which may be important when considering studies using NOS deficient mice The present study also suggests that exposure of neonatal mice to hypoxia may lead to more severe pulmonary hypertension than that observed in mature mice exposed to hypoxia and this warrants further study Abbreviations
