 Gross Conduct Movies American Pie Universal Pictures Mixed reviews but a boffo box office turnout for this teen sex comedy about four high school seniors determined to lose their virginity Critics take one of two positions 1 The gross out scenes one youth shtups an apple pie another drinks a beer laced with semen are just sucker bait to entice teenage audiences into the tent to see a movie that is as sweet and sincere at heart as anything Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland ever experienced Kenneth Turan the Los Angeles Times 2 Grossness is the film s essence D irty jokes are inserted at regular intervals like pop songs to perk up the action an upper middle class Porky s American Pie is unable to transcend its own dirty mind Among this year s bumper crop of teenage movies it is the shallowest and most prurient Stephen Holden the New York Times The most positive take comes from the Washington Post s Michael O Sullivan who writes that it s a warped hysterical and believe it or not sweet little gem of a movie Click to read David Edelstein s review in Slate and here to see the trailer that includes footage of the teen pastry union Arlington Road Sony Screen Gems Most critics are unimpressed by this thriller starring Jeff Bridges as a professor who becomes convinced that his new neighbor played by Tim Robbins is a domestic terrorist Roger Ebert the Chicago Sun Times speaks for most critics when he complains that the film begins well and makes good points but it flies off the rails in the last 30 minutes The climax is so implausible we stop caring and start scratching our heads The New York Times Janet Maslin departs from the pack calling the film a crackerjack thriller well paced and cleverly constructed Click here to watch the trailer Books True at First Light by Ernest Hemingway edited by Patrick Hemingway Scribner Critics heap scorn on this edited version of an unfinished fictional memoir left behind by Hemingway and crucify the writer s children for their

Deirdre Donahue USA Today It reflects a marvelous writer s disastrous loss of talent Kenneth S Lynn National Review a sad bloated inert so called book L S Klepp Entertainment Weekly The New York Times Michiko Kakutani after opening her review with an embarrassing parody of Hemingway s style writes that his angular language has turned maudlin and flabby The most positive review comes from James Wood

Straus Giroux Positive reviews for this philosophical novel about an e mail romance Although the plot seems ripped from You ve Got Mail the novel is far more sophisticated in its execution a Milan Kundera like inquiry into ontology the uniqueness of e mail communication and human existence in general Brownrigg s forte is her ability to emulate the curiously banal clever clever quasi poetic style that seems to afflict so many inhabitants of cyberspace Geoff Nicholson the New York Times Book Review in the many epistolary sections of the book and she wonderfully captures the ghostly dance of presence and absence that can characterize digital relationships Erik Davis the Voice Literary Supplement Click here to read the first chapter A Better War The Unexamined Victories and the Final Tragedy of America s Last Years in Vietnam by Lewis Sorley Harcourt Brace A retired CIA official and Army officer Sorley posits a new theory on the Vietnam War The United States won but the military victory was immediately undercut by diplomatic backtracking and congressional cowardice The New York Times Book Review assigned Jeffrey Record to review the book which seems an odd choice considering that Record just published a book titled The Wrong War Why We Lost in Vietnam Record predictably refutes Sorley s thesis How does one explain Saigon s fall when according to Sorley we had won the war by late 1971 but he concedes that A Better War is a comprehensive and long overdue examination of the immediate post Tet offensive years perhaps the most fascinating years of the war Other reviewers praise Sorley s research and writing A first rate challenge to the conventional wisdom about American military performance in Vietnam Publishers Weekly Click here to buy the book Harry Potter and the

90s most acclaimed jazz saxophonists The telepathy flows on this much awaited meeting Both men are noted risk takers and cutting edge improvisers whose penchant for the maniacal makes them ideal partners Karl Stark the Philadelphia Inquirer Gene Seymour writes in Newsday that there s a sense of play between the two that s almost kinda sweet Both are assertive Neither gets in the other s way
