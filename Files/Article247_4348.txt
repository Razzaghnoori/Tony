 Free Jim Cramer No Web site proprietor has been more vociferous about the importance of charging readers for content than TheStreet com s James J Cramer Our subscription model is precisely why we have been so successful in getting ads while others have failed miserably he wrote in a clamorous essay titled Wrong Take Two for TheStreet com less than four months ago After making all that noise Cramer softly announced today that TheStreet com is being split into five financial advice sites three paid and two free and that one of the free sites will be called TheStreet com Going free for news is a must if we are to compete worldwide for readers Cramer said in a press release Co founder Marty Peretz and I welcome this plan as a way to boost page views dramatically while growing additional revenue streams If Slate s experience is any guide Cramer s hopes of a big payoff from going free will be fulfilled And of course Slate also once was known for its noisy defense of the notion of charging for content But unlike Cramer or so it seems to me Slate never claimed that the paying model was the only true path and that anyone who disagreed was Wrong Our position was no one s figured it out yet we re trying this way A diligent search for embarrassing quotes found nothing better than a remark by Slate Editor Michael Kinsley when we began charging in 1998 that this was our fish or cut bait moment And It s important to us to break even and to be a business not someone s charity case When we reversed course 10 months later Kinsley was duly sheepish But Cramer does not traffic in agnosticism or sheepishness Just four months ago in Wrong Take Two he was calling free circulation proponents suicidalists deceivers and fools who have their adherents even within the walls of TheStreet com It makes me livid I regard these people as betrayers and scoundrels who would take the money we have all invested in TheStreet com and throw it away Relying on advertising to support content is hopeless he wrote I can t stress enough what a bust most advertising has been The ad revenues are totally anemic And they will stay that way for one main reason Most of the Web is free The vast majority of advertisers don t want to appear on free sites They don t trust them Maybe today s announcement is part of an elaborate strategy whereby Cramer will annually split his Web sites like amoebas and set some of them free like Lincoln always retaining some paid sites as starter dough for the next batch Hey it s a thicket of mixed metaphors but it isn t the craziest revenue model on the Web
