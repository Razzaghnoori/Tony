 okay the question was um what what is your opinion of youth uh spending a year or two in in public service i think it would be a great idea i m not sure about requiring it you know of people because people are going you know feeling resentful i don t know but i think it would be a great idea yeah seems like there s so many kids that don t have any since of you know what they want to be or do or you know they could learn something and maybe help other people at the same time and we sure our country all countries sure need help so um hum would uh would you be more in favor of uh you know like a local uh my only experience with it i was in Central America for a while and uh in San Salvador in El Salvador for instance everybody had what they called there social year hum um hum oh really uh that they that they had to put in and basically it was a uh repayment for for uh high school education um hum um and most of them joined the Red Cross and it was done internally i just there was very little external i think possibly what uh they re thinking about here more external Peace Corps type things where we re sending people off shore yeah well i think that would be real interesting for people to do but i guess my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them you know to other countries and hum and but i don t know if you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe maybe countries that are so poor that they wouldn t be able to really you know send children you know to do that yeah i don t i don t know how the Peace Corps works i guess i was of age when the Peace Corps came in and all that i didn t know yeah i was too i thought seriously about joining at that time i thought it was a fantastic idea did you ever get any information on it like i sent off for stuff on it but i don t remember that much about it i know that they trained you in the language and um that s that s what i was wondering about was whether they actually yeah you actually got paid too while in the Peace Corps it wasn t much but i guess they you could put some money aside while you were there your expenses were covered yeah was it yeah wasn t Jimmy Carter s mama that was in the Peace Corps or some such thing yeah i think so yeah yeah but it might be interesting to see what would happen if you took kids at a and then took then to another country instead of having being exposed to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here and take them to some other country that had different moral values something like Saudi Arabia where they couldn t drink where they couldn t do that yeah you might end up with a revolution i don t know which end though yeah really yeah i hadn t thought about that um hum yeah yeah that s that s been interesting though the kids that have been over you know coming back right now you know yeah you wonder if being exposed to that for a while what percentage of them would actually say hey that s not a bad way to do it because from what i understand from some of the guys i know crime uh is punishable just almost uh instantly and public hangings and yeah in public yeah and this sort of thing you know so you don t have just a whole lot of what we consider street crimes yeah yeah i ve heard that like in China and stuff there is virtually no such thing as rape because if you rape somebody you d be murdered them you know on the you know street so yeah yeah well i guess that s uh the price of freedom i guess is a little anyway the uh uh the the public service thing again i i i i guess in my own having had the whole three or four minutes to you know give it a great deal of thought here uh yeah i i think i agree with you one hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary but when you do that then it becomes almost uh or it can be yeah you know there are people will kind of set up their own little club yeah that s true and uh but if you know if you start the people that might benefit most from it might not go in that situation you know like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that yeah might not go if it was voluntary but i don t know how they d enforce it if it was yeah well if they went AWOL what are you going to do shoot them put them in jail yeah i don t know send them over to Iraq have a vacation in Iraq for a year yeah yeah yeah right yeah i know my dad always talked about uh he was in uh CCC during uh the depression and he was uh a rock rib Iowa type republican and the only good thing he could ever say about uh the yeah the whole Roosevelt administration was uh civilian conservation corps he because he was in it he thought that was great the rest of it was all hog wash but the that was great um hum yeah well it seems like it would develop pride you know in people if if it s in their own country it would certainly help them to appreciate some of the um hum things that we have here and develop some pride in them if it was handled that way i i it would take quite a few people i think it might build jobs for people you know that were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that so maybe that part of it would be helpful too um hum yeah i don t know yeah the only i d like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and mow the grass and well you know that brings up the interesting subject too you know what would you have who who who would determine what these people do yeah yeah you know if uh you know if it s run by the individual state you know like CCC was run by the army and in effect um hum and the only opposition to it really was that it was you know starting starting some sort of a military elitist type you know special corps of cadre of people that sort of thing and uh when the politics get real confusing um hum um hum yeah really there could be um some uh scandals involved if you know it wasn t people that were really fair and um hum leaving it you know in a legal way or something they could send all the people over to uh you know one particular part of town or one particular project that somebody had paid somebody to you know get supported or yeah well we ve we ve gotten to the point where you know if if if well it would be open for if the racial make up of the group was such and such you know they d have to do that percentage of work and what is perceived to be that part of town and you know all this kind of thing yeah that could be a complicated too couldn t it yeah oh yeah suppose uh well you know they they had a group who were construction oriented and they went and they they built uh can t think of a good example a swimming poo l or anything you know and one you can you can only build it in one place you know and know matter where you build it somebody else is going to scream well you didn t build one over here yeah that s true unfair or something yeah yeah yeah i think uh oh boy it s one of those things on the surface you know it seems like a great idea it s like a joke i heard once about uh elephant foot soup you know it s easy to do once you find a elephant foot it s it s uh it s the logistics of the thing that uh that that gets you going yeah really yeah well it seems like there s there s a lot you don t hear much on the news about young people really you know wanting to do anything good or anything like that but you know i m sure that there are a lot of young people out there that really do have good hearts and are willing to help and serve and that kind of thing i just i saw on the news the other night that the uh the little girl that used to be the littlest girl on the Cosby show Kisha Knight Pullman was starting a i guess now she s practically a teenager yeah she started some type of um national um organization for youth to volunteer to teach tutor other kids to read and you know do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards um hum you know helpful things and i know even like in the high schools in Dallas there s a couple high schools that have wanted to start like a um minority you know um i think it was in a Hispanic area they wanted to start like a club for the teenagers instead of they said every all these gangs kids could join to belong um hum but they didn t have anything positive the kids could be doing helping you know so they were trying to start that out so if there s people out there that are yeah willing to you know kids that are willing to sacrifice their time and energy gosh we ought to use them you know yeah if their willing to do it yeah it s it s it s just the you know here you to the logistics of the thing again you know who yeah who s going to run it you know what how oh it s just so many yeah yeah well like like i said at the beginning i ve got so many connections with people in Central America my daughter in law is Panamanian you know and they have situations like like that down there where they hum um hum they have these the social in some sort of way if you want to go to school outside the country and many Salvadorians did they d go to school in Cornell Iowa of all places huh and when they came back they d have to serve this this this year and it turned out to be kind of a joke the ones i knew you know always chose the Red Cross because they didn t do anything oh i see and they had all kinds of uh things they could go into agricultural and you know really you know good stuff but uh unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that Red Cross yeah it was so many of them in it that at any particular chance your chance of having to do something was very slim it was very slim and so yeah yeah well we um belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints which is like the nickname the Mormon church um hum um hum and um the there is men and also women women aren t um nearly as frequent and also that have elderly couples once their kids have left that can volunteer to go on a mission and um they re all over the world and its it is an incredible logistics i mean they have a training center where they teach them it s called the Missionary Training Center in Utah and they have to be taught the language um hum customs and all those kinds of things and then they um you know go and actually live in that country for the the uh young men do it for two years and the young women for eighteen months okay then that s uh kind of a private right organization you know i m i m familiar with my instructor pilot was a was a Mormon he was because he was a good construction uh you know instructor instructor pilot because he considered himself indestructible oh he had a direct connection somewhere uh yeah yeah right he felt that he really had an in so you know he things he would do with an airplane but any rate that s off the subject no i haven t seen i haven t seen yeah yeah but see they don t get paid for it and um but there is funding that that comes they re supposedly saving up on their own and the church helps them out some you know um hum but you know that it is incredible you you know i seen how they were organized in in central and South America and uh it s uh yeah it s very involved
