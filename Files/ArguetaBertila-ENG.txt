                     How should I start                              However you like                     Well life there in the country is nice tranquil         I lived working all of my life with livestock         I always had to get up early milk the cows and uh run run them as we say because its a to the pastures until times got pretty bad and one day I sent my daughter to to the pasture to bring in the cows         We brought them back in the afternoon when I saw that behind her there came a big group of they looked like soldiers but in street clothes         Then she cam my daughter came almost green pale and she said to me Mama she said to me Those are guerrillas         That was the first time I saw them the gue the guerillas         Then they went on they didnt make it to the house         At about about three weeks later then arrived a group of about four at my brothers house and told him that they were coming to to be that is to take control of the place where we lived         Well but that they werent going to steal they werent going to kill neither would they harm the people but it we didnt if we worked with them         But if we didnt want to work with them we shouldnt get them into anything with the mil military such as informing on them or something like that         So time went on         Then when well since I lived alone only with my son they would seek me out because I always had everything because I had all kinds of animals including doves from Castile uh turkeys ducks hens pigs cows all kinds of animals         So they would they would always come to me and they told me Maam sell us milk sell us yogurt sell us cheese or sell us a a hog a plump hog well I had to sell them and I am going to sell hed said if you sell them to everyone else sell to us too         I say to him OK         And thats how I kept on working and with them         They there well theyd come from time to time to buy things until one day well they already had been there for several years when all of a sudden along came a young fellow who went around with them whose name was Jose they call him Chepon because he was tall white and all         So he he came looking for yogurt I dont know what he came looking for for me to sell him         And when I was giving it to him he said to me Theres going to be a meeting now         When         I said to him         No tomorrow at four he said to me         Where         I said to him         In Piedras de Sal that was like a pretty level place where they gathered         And I said to him Im not going to be able to go         Why         he said to me         I said to him I have a lot to do I said to him         He said to me You have to go he said to me         I said to him dont you know Chepe what it is         I said to him that they want to do in that meeting         He said to me we cant say         I said to him But you know Im your friend tell me why         Then he said to me that theyre going to set up a board he said to me where theyre going to appoint he said to me a president vice president secretary treasurers and all that         And I said to him And what is that for         Because theyre going to set up a committee he said to me so that when those big battalions he said to me of guerrillas arrive these people attend for example the president is going to talk to the rest so that they all get food together for them         And theyve picked you he said to me         Me         I said to him Why         I said to him         He says Yes because you have less children and can have more time or more ability to get around to the people so they will help out         And I said to him Yes         President of what         They call it he said The Committee of Forsaken Mothers         I said Really         Yes he said         So I said No I said Im not going to be able to go         He said But dont you ever tell that I told you because he said         He motioned to me as if they were going to cut off his head         I said No Im not going to tell them         So the next day I left early in the morning for San Miguel to see my daughter and when I was coming back I went by my brothers which was a place in a town called Chapeltique and I arrived at his place and I said his name is Salomon and I said Brother I am here to see if youll give me posada lodging we call it like you give someone a place to live in your own house         And he said Whats going on         I said Nothing its just that I dont want to be there any longer I said Look its just that I have lots of problems with the animals I dont even have a pasture         He says Really         I said And do you think you can help me         I told him Im coming         Yes I says         That same while that I was there at my brothers we went to look for the people who owned land to see if they would give me pasture land for the animals         And yes they gave me some and I left         It was getting I got there late like at six in the afternoon I got home and after I waited for it to get dark I went to my neighbors         My neighbor had about four five grown boys         So I said to him his name is Pedro I said Pedro I came to bother you         Uh huh         I said If you if you would lend me your boys tomorrow         What for         he said         I said I need I said I need for you to lend me them to me tell me and Ill pay you         He said Yes you know he said You can count on them and me too if if you need me         I said Look I need them to over there about five six in the morning five thirty because Im leaving here I said and I want them to take the most important things to town for me because since from from my place to town was about two hours on the road walking then because no cars came through         So he said OK thats fine         And the same way I went out to another er e cousin his name is Cristobal and I said Cristobal do you have to what are you doing tomorrow         Nothing he said Why         I was going to bother you I said  so you come with me I say I want you to do me a favor         Uhhuh         I want to leave I said but I dont want anybody to know         If you help me I said to move my livestock to Chapeltique         He said But to take the livestock I cant I cant do it alone at least four he said because its difficult with the animals         OK I said So how do we do it         You suggest something         OK he said Let me wait for me here Im going to let dad know and Cristobals neighbors friends         And he left and thats how it was         When he came back he said Yes so he said Im going to leave here he said from your house for Chapeltique at four in the morning with the livestock         And thats how it was he left at dawn and he said See you there and he left with the with the livestock with the and the the others who were going to help         I stayed at home finishing straightening up and the neighbors Pedros boys already took my things to town and we left for Chapeltique         We arrived at my brothers and Cristobal with the livestock and the rest still hadnt arrived         They arrived at night but they brought them for me         And thats the way it as how I kept working there         After I worked there then that I went to San Miguel because my daughter also had she needed me         And I kept on and finally when I saw that life was really expensive and I didnt have I couldnt work anymore since Im not a professional then I decided to come to the US because also well the there in that area since now there wasnt anywhere to work I had left hidden from the guerrillas and well thats what I continued         Well and I forgot to tell you when the soldiers came to my house the guerrillas were there the guerrillas went back         They hid and the soldiers came to the house         It was when the first one arrived the first soldier and he said Er maam make he said some four six rations he said because plenty of soldiers have come and Im going to inform the other houses         I stayed making the rations of food when a group of soldiers arrives and when I was fixing the food in the kitchen because of the sun because of the reflection of the sun I saw a weapon pointing at me so that was when I said to him What happened         And he said Dont play the soldier said dont play he said innocent he said in that house I our house is huge and I stayed locked up because just me and my son lived my baby son tiny and me and well thats all         And I said I dont have anybody I said hidden away         He says Dont let it happen to you like the people in Ateltisate that was another area where we did away with the place because they covered up the guerrillas         I told him I dont cover up anybody I said         Then with me at gunpoint two behind followed me so I opened the door and there was nothing in the house thank God because there was no one there         Then since then I I was like when I saw military I felt like I I that is a great fear a terror of the guerrillas I was afraid of them but the military was worse         And I couldnt well do anything else         We lived between between the border of Honduras and El Salvador         Then they the guerrillas passed through this river that divided the countries and it filled up with men when you remembered it it was full like any base         And then the soldiers would pass through just the same         So you couldnt tell what kind at night what kind of people were going by but you could hear clatter because even beasts full of weapons with everything you know         So that time that I told you about when the the soldiers came my son escaped dying from fear when I go that they had me at gunpoint and they surrounded the house but it passed they didnt do anything         The next time the soldiers came through the guerrillas were in front of the house in the road theres one of those huge rocks that you can sit on and when they were eating         When all of a sudden a girl went by I was washing clothes a girl went by and she told me she was going to here moms her name is Victoria         And when the guerrillas ah well the girl went by and very shortly she came back         And I said Why did you come back Victoria         A huge group of soldiers are coming         she said I mean a huge group         she said so Im going         So I came in from where I was washing I went in and I didnt see what the guerrillas did with themselves because I didnt see they were in front but since I went it I didnt see         Then you know that in order to keep yourself out of trouble you go in and dont then they come or that was another time that I suffered a terrible threat when the soldiers come through         And he said Maam he said what did the guerrillas that were there eating do with themselves         I said Sir Ive gone in and I dont know the house is big and I went inside I told him I havent seen anyone         He says Look maam he says you deserve to have your tongue cut out because you are covering for the guerrillas         I told him I dont cover for the guerrillas or for you          Why would I cover for them         So he says No from the school up are all guerrillas         I said The fact you I you can be there I said or I can stay here and you go in I said you dont see where I get off to         Then they left they left for the mountain they went on up         Then a huge throng of soldiers came and they shot over the house that we have to my dad always used to have a lot of we call them cercos  of of pure ijiote of of made of poles that are nice and fresh         Then every little bit since they were shooting those bazookas and who knows what kind of of things and all the tops of the trees were falling they fell and since the roof was made of teja tile         Do you know what a teja is                     I dont know                     But its like this          in plenty of shapes I see that here they also have some shaped like tejas too                     Are they like rounded                     No theyre long things like this          they come down to here and here another one goes on top yes very pretty like like between orange because theyre fired theyre made of fired clay         Well then the dust from the the tiles was falling because well they were destroying them right         Well so many bullets so many things         Then and the neighbors and a niece of mine and a cousin lived there and bullets went through my nephews and he had a fiveyearold daughter who was the only one who was there because her mom had gone to bring water and she stayed because of the firefight she also stayed inside so that she wouldnt the little girl locked herself in and thank God she survived         And when then that was the first time that my little boy came down with as if I dont know he didnt faint but he he turned purple here indicates area around her mouth green and then purple and then he stopped breathing fell to the floor         So then I grabbed him and when I grabbed him I put him under the bed and I went outside         In uh in the window in front we have a window facing the street there was a guerrilla lying on the ground firing at the soldiers         On this other side where the bedroom was I went outside and I saw him well the size of the flame when the flame from the rif from the bullet came out even with a small flame like this                  I told him Please sir get away from here dont you see the danger         I said         He sa he didnt answer me         Redfaced tired and redfaced the man and on the other side the other end of the house there were two others shooting so that also also stretched out on the ground         Then I said Dear Lord I said what are we going to do about this         Well they went through they broke a soldiers leg you could hear his moaning         Then they went through since they were carrying him away like that         And thats the way it stayed the firefights there in that place and the firefights         Well one day I sai I was going from San Miguel uh to Carolina my brother lived my brother was the principal of that of that school there in Carolina         He worked hes a teacher and at that time he worked as the principal of that school of that school because it was a like a high school there was from first grade to high school         So early that morning that afternoon I came down from San Miguel and I told him Im going to go         He says Dont go         Theyre making trincheras they call them trincheras where theyre putting mounds of stones near the houses so that the bullets there         He says And its going to be very dangerous and its very late         So I said to him Oh well Im going to go when its morning         My son was already two not even two years old like like about like a year and a half         So she he my brother and his wife had two boys too         One of the wifes brothers had come         When all of a sudden at daybreak my my brother went to to bring a to the well close by there two jugs of water his wife and he and I stayed in the house making coffee         That the sun hadnt come up yet it was still like five in the morning         Well it wasnt light yet when the gunfire starts         Because in the front of the two the res a mountain that they call El Volcancillo the little volcano below         Its just that what a firefight         They were shooting shells bomb even from those bazookas and I dont know what kind of weapons         Well my brother had a cow tied out and a goat the cows offspring         Well he milked the cow every morning but that day he couldnt milk her because the gunfire was so heavy and because everything was falling near the house         So my brother said Im going to cut her rope Im not going to be able to untie her he said Because its really difficult with by the time I untie her theyll kill me he says         Im going to cut it with the a knife the knot so the cow can go and she wont die         Then he is when a shell like this         falls that went into the ground but a lot         And the the fragments as they call them cut him here indicates several parts of body cut him here cut his here cut him here and I dont know where else but there were many but the deepest one was this one                  He didnt say anything         We were down I had my son under me on the floor Ines had one and Ines brother that is the boys uncle had the other boy under him         Only Luis Alonso had gone out         Well nobody noticed my brother until he said Vieja Old lady he said because thats how they talked to each other Vieja he said I may be going to die and we turned him around to see what the the         He had a pillow one of those big pillows and it looked red all of it with blood and swollen like this                  So he said from the running down from several places but the one that this one indicates eyebrow was was too much         So she said Ines went out and opened the door and said Bastards         she said to them to the guerrillas Bastards         she said to them because of you were going to die too through no fault of our own         she said         They didnt answer         She closed the door and Ines said to me What are we going to do with Luis Alonso         Now we now we didnt we didnt pay attention to the kids we had forgotten about the kids we were going to attend to my brother         But a car was coming by with a white flag that meant peace and in that car there was a friend of Luis Alonsos and also a guerrilla came in that car         And so they came in through the interior door there they turned like this and came in through the door and and they knocked         Luis Alonso Luis Alonso says to him Luis Alonsos friend         Than Ines says to him What was it         she said         Open the door please         Ive come to see Luis Alonso he says         Because well no Ines was putting up an argument that when he told her No he said e Luis Alonso I may be going to die he said because so much blood loss he said         No he said Im going to take you to such guerrillas doctor and they took him away         They took out all the rest of the shrapnel but the one in his eyebrow they couldnt get it out         So they tool him away we didnt see him anymore they took him to San Miguel I dont know if in that vehicle surely in the same car they were riding in they took him to the hospital         Then we were left and since they were still in front of the house we went to a womans home who was a nurse so when a big round of gunfire started we covered ourselves up against the walls of the houses we walked a little way we threw ourselves against the other wall until we could get there         And when we got there the woman said Go on in to the main house and another house father inside         And there was a wounded a wounded woman by by a bullet too that they had brought since she was a nurse and there we were         The woman prepared food but she only gave it to the children         All that day we didnt get up off the floor         So we stayed there         And then well we found out that my brother had been admitted until they took out th that fragment they let him come but now he didnt come he went to to the department of education and asked a transfer they didnt deny it to him they transferred him to another place immediately         Then he came and we stayed on in the same place         Then now well like I told you there were plenty of times that that we had encounters like that         There in in another part of Tejutla they also killed a brotherinlaw of mine my sisters husband because the guerrillas also came in in the night         They had a big firefight like that and there was my bro er my brotherinlaw was he also died         Thats the way way it was theyre big plenty if I were to tell you all the stories of what we went through I tell you that Id keep you all night                  Thats how it was it was said but thank God in the family hardly The guerrillas also took out a man from the outskirts near the the place where we lived who was called Juan         He was like a catequist one of those people who helps the priests and according to the guerrillas they say that he was starting to get them in trouble with the army I mean he started to say where they were so that the soldiers would go directly to where they were and one day they guerrillas took him out and killed him         And they put out the the word that yes they had killed him         So and if another another person did that they were going to kill him too         Because there were a lot more things         And what else do you want me to tell you                              If you want to keep on thats fine but so much time
