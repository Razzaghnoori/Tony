 How should I start However you like Well life there in the country is nice tranquil I lived working all of my life with livestock I always had to get up early milk the cows and uh run run them as we say because it s a to the pastures until times got pretty bad and one day I sent my daughter to to the pasture to bring in the cows We brought them back in the afternoon when I saw that behind her there came a big group of they looked like soldiers but in street clothes Then she cam my daughter came almost green pale and she said to me Mama she said to me Those are guerrillas That was the first time I saw them the gue the guerillas Then they went on they didn t make it to the house At about about three weeks later then arrived a group of about four at my brother s house and told him that they were coming to to be that is to take control of the place where we lived Well but that they weren t going to steal they weren t going to kill neither would they harm the people but it we didn t if we worked with them But if we didn t want to work with them we shouldn t get them into anything with the mil military such as informing on them or something like that So time went on Then when well since I lived alone only with my son they would seek me out because I always had everything because I had all kinds of animals including doves from Castile uh turkeys ducks hens pigs cows all kinds of animals So they would they would always come to me and they told me Ma am sell us milk sell us yogurt sell us cheese or sell us a a hog a plump hog well I had to sell them and I am going to sell he d said if you sell them to everyone else sell to us too I say to him OK And that s how I kept on working and with them They there well they d come from time to time to buy things until one day well they already had been there for several years when all of a sudden along came a young fellow who went around with them whose name was Jose they call him Chepon because he was tall white and all So he he came looking for yogurt I don t know what he came looking for for me to sell him And when I was giving it to him he said to me There s going to be a meeting now When I said to him No tomorrow at four he said to me Where I said to him In Piedras de Sal that was like a pretty level place where they gathered And I said to him I m not going to be able to go Why he said to me I said to him I have a lot to do I said to him He said to me You have to go he said to me I said to him don t you know Chepe what it is I said to him that they want to do in that meeting He said to me we can t say I said to him But you know I m your friend tell me why Then he said to me that they re going to set up a board he said to me where they re going to appoint he said to me a president vice president secretary treasurers and all that And I said to him And what is that for Because they re going to set up a committee he said to me so that when those big battalions he said to me of guerrillas arrive these people attend for example the president is going to talk to the rest so that they all get food together for them And they ve picked you he said to me Me I said to him Why I said to him He says Yes because you have less children and can have more time or more ability to get around to the people so they will help out And I said to him Yes President of what They call it he said The Committee of Forsaken Mothers I said Really Yes he said So I said No I said I m not going to be able to go He said But don t you ever tell that I told you because he said He motioned to me as if they were going to cut off his head I said No I m not going to tell them So the next day I left early in the morning for San Miguel to see my daughter and when I was coming back I went by my brother s which was a place in a town called Chapeltique and I arrived at his place and I said his name is Salomon and I said Brother I am here to see if you ll give me posada lodging we call it like you give someone a place to live in your own house And he said What s going on I said Nothing it s just that I don t want to be there any longer I said Look it s just that I have lots of problems with the animals I don t even have a pasture He says Really I said And do you think you can help me I told him I m coming Yes I says That same while that I was there at my brother s we went to look for the people who owned land to see if they would give me pasture land for the animals And yes they gave me some and I left It was getting I got there late like at six in the afternoon I got home and after I waited for it to get dark I went to my neighbor s My neighbor had about four five grown boys So I said to him his name is Pedro I said Pedro I came to bother you Uh huh I said If you if you would lend me your boys tomorrow What for he said I said I need I said I need for you to lend me them to me tell me and I ll pay you He said Yes you know he said You can count on them and me too if if you need me I said Look I need them to over there about five six in the morning five thirty because I m leaving here I said and I want them to take the most important things to town for me because since from from my place to town was about two hours on the road walking then because no cars came through So he said OK that s fine And the same way I went out to another er e cousin his name is Cristobal and I said Cristobal do you have to what are you doing tomorrow Nothing he said Why I was going to bother you I said so you come with me I say I want you to do me a favor Uh huh I want to leave I said but I don t want anybody to know If you help me I said to move my livestock to Chapeltique He said But to take the livestock I can t I can t do it alone at least four he said because it s difficult with the animals OK I said So how do we do it You suggest something OK he said Let me wait for me here I m going to let dad know and Cristobal s neighbors friends And he left and that s how it was When he came back he said Yes so he said I m going to leave here he said from your house for Chapeltique at four in the morning with the livestock And that s how it was he left at dawn and he said See you there and he left with the with the livestock with the and the the others who were going to help I stayed at home finishing straightening up and the neighbors Pedro s boys already took my things to town and we left for Chapeltique We arrived at my brother s and Cristobal with the livestock and the rest still hadn t arrived They arrived at night but they brought them for me And that s the way it as how I kept working there After I worked there then that I went to San Miguel because my daughter also had she needed me And I kept on and finally when I saw that life was really expensive and I didn t have I couldn t work anymore since I m not a professional then I decided to come to the US because also well the there in that area since now there wasn t anywhere to work I had left hidden from the guerrillas and well that s what I continued Well and I forgot to tell you when the soldiers came to my house the guerrillas were there the guerrillas went back They hid and the soldiers came to the house It was when the first one arrived the first soldier and he said Er ma am make he said some four six rations he said because plenty of soldiers have come and I m going to inform the other houses I stayed making the rations of food when a group of soldiers arrives and when I was fixing the food in the kitchen because of the sun because of the reflection of the sun I saw a weapon pointing at me so that was when I said to him What happened And he said Don t play the soldier said don t play he said innocent he said in that house I our house is huge and I stayed locked up because just me and my son lived my baby son tiny and me and well that s all And I said I don t have anybody I said hidden away He says Don t let it happen to you like the people in Ateltisate that was another area where we did away with the place because they covered up the guerrillas I told him I don t cover up anybody I said Then with me at gunpoint two behind followed me so I opened the door and there was nothing in the house thank God because there was no one there Then since then I I was like when I saw military I felt like I I that is a great fear a terror of the guerrillas I was afraid of them but the military was worse And I couldn t well do anything else We lived between between the border of Honduras and El Salvador Then they the guerrillas passed through this river that divided the countries and it filled up with men when you remembered it it was full like any base And then the soldiers would pass through just the same So you couldn t tell what kind at night what kind of people were going by but you could hear clatter because even beasts full of weapons with everything you know So that time that I told you about when the the soldiers came my son escaped dying from fear when I go that they had me at gunpoint and they surrounded the house but it passed they didn t do anything The next time the soldiers came through the guerrillas were in front of the house in the road there s one of those huge rocks that you can sit on and when they were eating When all of a sudden a girl went by I was washing clothes a girl went by and she told me she was going to here mom s her name is Victoria And when the guerrillas ah well the girl went by and very shortly she came back And I said Why did you come back Victoria A huge group of soldiers are coming she said I mean a huge group she said so I m going So I came in from where I was washing I went in and I didn t see what the guerrillas did with themselves because I didn t see they were in front but since I went it I didn t see Then you know that in order to keep yourself out of trouble you go in and don t then they come or that was another time that I suffered a terrible threat when the soldiers come through And he said Ma am he said what did the guerrillas that were there eating do with themselves I said Sir I ve gone in and I don t know the house is big and I went inside I told him I haven t seen anyone He says Look ma am he says you deserve to have your tongue cut out because you are covering for the guerrillas I told him I don t cover for the guerrillas or for you Why would I cover for them So he says No from the school up are all guerrillas I said The fact you I you can be there I said or I can stay here and you go in I said you don t see where I get off to Then they left they left for the mountain they went on up Then a huge throng of soldiers came and they shot over the house that we have to my dad always used to have a lot of we call them cercos of of pure ijiote of of made of poles that are nice and fresh Then every little bit since they were shooting those bazookas and who knows what kind of of things and all the tops of the trees were falling they fell and since the roof was made of teja tile Do you know what a teja is I don t know But it s like this in plenty of shapes I see that here they also have some shaped like tejas too Are they like rounded No they re long things like this they come down to here and here another one goes on top yes very pretty like like between orange because they re fired they re made of fired clay Well then the dust from the the tiles was falling because well they were destroying them right Well so many bullets so many things Then and the neighbors and a niece of mine and a cousin lived there and bullets went through my nephew s and he had a five year old daughter who was the only one who was there because her mom had gone to bring water and she stayed because of the firefight she also stayed inside so that she wouldn t the little girl locked herself in and thank God she survived And when then that was the first time that my little boy came down with as if I don t know he didn t faint but he he turned purple here indicates area around her mouth green and then purple and then he stopped breathing fell to the floor So then I grabbed him and when I grabbed him I put him under the bed and I went outside In uh in the window in front we have a window facing the street there was a guerrilla lying on the ground firing at the soldiers On this other side where the bedroom was I went outside and I saw him well the size of the flame when the flame from the rif from the bullet came out even with a small flame like this I told him Please sir get away from here don t you see the danger I said He sa he didn t answer me Red faced tired and red faced the man and on the other side the other end of the house there were two others shooting so that also also stretched out on the ground Then I said Dear Lord I said what are we going to do about this Well they went through they broke a soldier s leg you could hear his moaning Then they went through since they were carrying him away like that And that s the way it stayed the firefights there in that place and the firefights Well one day I sai I was going from San Miguel uh to Carolina my brother lived my brother was the principal of that of that school there in Carolina He worked he s a teacher and at that time he worked as the principal of that school of that school because it was a like a high school there was from first grade to high school So early that morning that afternoon I came down from San Miguel and I told him I m going to go He says Don t go They re making trincheras they call them trincheras where they re putting mounds of stones near the houses so that the bullets there He says And it s going to be very dangerous and it s very late So I said to him Oh well I m going to go when it s morning My son was already two not even two years old like like about like a year and a half So she he my brother and his wife had two boys too One of the wife s brothers had come When all of a sudden at daybreak my my brother went to to bring a to the well close by there two jugs of water his wife and he and I stayed in the house making coffee That the sun hadn t come up yet it was still like five in the morning Well it wasn t light yet when the gunfire starts Because in the front of the two the re s a mountain that they call El Volcancillo the little volcano below It s just that what a firefight They were shooting shells bomb even from those bazookas and I don t know what kind of weapons Well my brother had a cow tied out and a goat the cow s offspring Well he milked the cow every morning but that day he couldn t milk her because the gunfire was so heavy and because everything was falling near the house So my brother said I m going to cut her rope I m not going to be able to untie her he said Because it s really difficult with by the time I untie her they ll kill me he says I m going to cut it with the a knife the knot so the cow can go and she won t die Then he is when a shell like this falls that went into the ground but a lot And the the fragments as they call them cut him here indicates several parts of body cut him here cut his here cut him here and I don t know where else but there were many but the deepest one was this one He didn t say anything We were down I had my son under me on the floor Ines had one and Ines brother that is the boy s uncle had the other boy under him Only Luis Alonso had gone out Well nobody noticed my brother until he said Vieja Old lady he said because that s how they talked to each other Vieja he said I may be going to die and we turned him around to see what the the He had a pillow one of those big pillows and it looked red all of it with blood and swollen like this So he said from the running down from several places but the one that this one indicates eyebrow was was too much So she said Ines went out and opened the door and said Bastards she said to them to the guerrillas Bastards she said to them because of you we re going to die too through no fault of our own she said They didn t answer She closed the door and Ines said to me What are we going to do with Luis Alonso Now we now we didn t we didn t pay attention to the kids we had forgotten about the kids we were going to attend to my brother But a car was coming by with a white flag that meant peace and in that car there was a friend of Luis Alonso s and also a guerrilla came in that car And so they came in through the interior door there they turned like this and came in through the door and and they knocked Luis Alonso Luis Alonso says to him Luis Alonso s friend Than Ines says to him What was it she said Open the door please I ve come to see Luis Alonso he says Because well no Ines was putting up an argument that when he told her No he said e Luis Alonso I may be going to die he said because so much blood loss he said No he said I m going to take you to such guerrillas doctor and they took him away They took out all the rest of the shrapnel but the one in his eyebrow they couldn t get it out So they tool him away we didn t see him anymore they took him to San Miguel I don t know if in that vehicle surely in the same car they were riding in they took him to the hospital Then we were left and since they were still in front of the house we went to a woman s home who was a nurse so when a big round of gunfire started we covered ourselves up against the walls of the houses we walked a little way we threw ourselves against the other wall until we could get there And when we got there the woman said Go on in to the main house and another house father inside And there was a wounded a wounded woman by by a bullet too that they had brought since she was a nurse and there we were The woman prepared food but she only gave it to the children All that day we didn t get up off the floor So we stayed there And then well we found out that my brother had been admitted until they took out th that fragment0 they let him come but now he didn t come he went to to the department of education and asked a transfer they didn t deny it to him they transferred him to another place immediately Then he came and we stayed on in the same place Then now well like I told you there were plenty of times that that we had encounters like that There in in another part of Tejutla they also killed a brother in law of mine my sister s husband because the guerrillas also came in in the night They had a big firefight like that and there was my bro er my brother in law was he also died That s the way way it was they re big plenty if I were to tell you all the stories of what we went through I tell you that I d keep you all night That s how it was it was said but thank God in the family hardly The guerrillas also took out a man from the outskirts near the the place where we lived who was called Juan He was like a catequist one of those people who helps the priests and according to the guerrillas they say that he was starting to get them in trouble with the army I mean he started to say where they were so that the soldiers would go directly to where they were and one day they guerrillas took him out and killed him And they put out the the word that yes they had killed him So and if another another person did that they were going to kill him too Because there were a lot more things And what else do you want me to tell you If you want to keep on that s fine but so much time
