 Hell on Wheels Bringing Out the Dead provides director Martin Scorsese with a rich milieu for one of his patented pumped up odysseys of the soul an urban bedlam as seen through the eyes of an emergency medical technician Frank Pierce Nicolas Cage The film is based on a book by Joe Connelly who cruised the streets of Manhattan in an ambulance from the mid 80s to the early 90s when the crack epidemic was peaking and New York had become the embodiment of everything untenable about major American cities Connelly spent a lot of time picking up shooting victims crackheads in the throes of cardiac arrest and homeless drunks some from the first wave of Reagan era deinstitutionalization and bringing them to the overpacked emergency room of what he calls Our Lady of Misery Hospital The book is a memoir reframed as a novel It boils those years down to a couple of days in which Pierce clutches vainly at the last vestiges of sanity Night after night he has visions of a young Hispanic asthmatic whom he failed to resuscitate Her head stares accusingly at him from the shoulders of people he passes on the street It s not just that he can t forgive himself for not having saved her life it s that he can t forgive himself for putting her out of his mind He can t live with the idea that he has become indifferent The material has so many Scorsese like motifs that it s easy to see why the director fell on it and passed it on to his Taxi Driver 1976 screenwriter Paul Schrader who has said he finished the script in three weeks I can believe that and not just because there s so much dialogue and narration from the book on screen It s probable that Connelly thought of Taxi Driver and Mean Streets 1973 when he wrote his novel so having it adapted by Schrader and Scorsese was like closing the circle But what the circle really needed was opening It s not just that slow motion scenes of the ambulance gliding past people beating one another up feel like d j vu It s that Schrader hasn t rethought Connelly s trumped up story line The movie starts with Pierce and his occasional partner Larry John Goodman trudging to the top floor of a Hell s Kitchen brownstone where a man named Burke has been in cardiac arrest for 10 minutes They manage to get Burke s heart started but his brain shows only scant traces of activity and in the hospital he keeps flatlining and being resuscitated 15 16 17 times In and out of the emergency room over the course of several nights Pierce gets chummy with Burke s estranged daughter Mary Patricia Arquette a lost soul whose shellshocked existence she begins to drift back into drug abuse seems tied in to her dad s neither living nor dead condition Pretty soon I got the sinking feeling that the movie was building to the possibility of a mercy killing as a test of the hero s ability to overcome his internal chaos and feel something It s true that Pierce s altruistic impulse is not on par with Travis Bickle s impulse to shave his head and assassinate a presidential candidate but Schrader and Scorsese don t view his actions with any irony I have a feeling they needed an ending and this one was handy Their opportunism is a shame because there s enough texture in Bringing Out the Dead for several movies Scorsese does crackerjack work and some of the cruising imagery not a bebop legato as in Taxi Driver but hyperfast and strobelike is startling There s a scary irony built into the material that the people charged with saving lives on the streets can t function at normal rhythms that their amphetamine jag intensity can make them as likely to want to murder people as to revive them Scorsese and Schrader are at their most inspired in the raucous theater of the emergency room in which patients on stretchers scream at one another to shut up and an admitting nurse played by Schrader s wife the brilliant Mary Beth Hurt takes pains to let the drunks and addicts and failed suicides know just how much they re imposing on her Why should we help You re just going to get drunk tomorrow Scorsese and Queen Latifah can be heard as the voices of the dispatchers and their calls they often have to bully the drivers to answer are beautifully shaped comic turns Years of sitcom work haven t softened Goodman whose Larry is sour unlovable thickened by indifference As another of Pierce s partners Ving Rhames talks into the radio like a toasty voiced DJ Big Daddy Marcus is alive and strides through his scenes with an unlit cigar in his mouth defiantly proclaiming his potency The mixture of jokiness and blood never feels cheap it adds to the movie s theme which is horrified estrangement from one s own humanity I must admit that the movie made me weep a couple of times It s hard to watch with detachment as tubes are thrust down people s throats or as they re shocked back to life Some of the more jaded characters act as if life is cheap but Scorsese doesn t And everything Nicolas Cage does gives weight to the filmmaker s vision Cage has the same flamboyantly haggard and toothy look he had in Vampire s Kiss 1989 yet this time the actor is grounded His Pierce would love to soar off into the ether to escape into madness but he can t quite make the leap Sometimes it s less about saving lives than being a witness he says in voice over I was a grief mop It was enough that I simply showed up Cage s wary alertness does those words justice One of the best things about David Lynch s marvelous new film The Straight Story is its play on straight which is both the name of the protagonist the failing septuagenarian Alvin Straight Richard Farnsworth and a description of the movie s one thing after another mode of storytelling Farnsworth plays an old duffer who hears that his brother Lyle has had a stroke It emerges that they haven t spoken for a decade and the last time they did Alvin said some devastatingly harsh things So as a kind of penance Alvin decides to travel hundreds of miles to Lyle s house under his own power The only vehicle he s legally allowed to drive is a John Deere lawn mower that goes maybe three miles an hour But somehow the mode of travel and the hardship of that travel becomes the movie s message I was impatient with The Straight Story s opening the arty dissolves the crawling pace the sense of stasis But once Alvin left his mentally handicapped daughter a radiantly simple turn by Sissy Spacek for the open road it becomes apparent that Lynch needed those early scenes He needed to show you that as slow as Alvin is going on his tractor it s flying next to what he has been doing As Alvin encounters a lot of plain folks both the character and the movie threaten to start seeming dear But the vein of regret misery and the Lynchian promise of decay is always just below the surface and always palpable In Lynch s last film Lost Highway the director concocted an original twisty syntax in which identity was mutable and the narrative moved by quantum leaps This time he sticks to the path and his work is as transcendent and as spellbinding as anything he has done since Blue Velvet 1986 Lynch has slowed the world down and gotten back in touch with it The Straight Story could be subtitled Found Highway
