 Background Carbenoxolone the succinyl ester of glycyrrhetinic acid 1 is now used in clinical treatment of ulcer diseases 2 It has some pharmacological properties such as the inhibition of 11 hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase 11 HSD 1 and inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication 3 Electrotonic synaptic communication between neurons via gap junctions GJs is increasingly recognized as an important synchronizing mechanism in the brain The pathogenesis of abnormal neuronal synchrony underlying seizures formerly thought to be based mainly on the chemical synaptic transmission now includes a role of gap junctional communication This concept has been strengthened by evidence from several in vitro models in which pharmacological manipulations of gap junctional communication predictably affect the generation of seizures blockers diminishing seizure and enhancers increasing the seizures 4 GJ channels can contribute to the prolongation of epileptiform discharges 5 In in vitro studies carbenoxolone abolished the generation of full or partial ectopic spike generation by 4 AP in the CA 3 region of rat hippocampal slices 6 Also carbenoxolone depresses spontaneous epileptiform activity in the CA 1 region of rat hippocampal slices 7 Carbenoxolone appears to cross the blood brain barrier about one hour after an intraperitoneal injection in rats as there was the inhibition of 11 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in multiple brain regions 1 It and or its congener glycyrrehetinic acid may also enter the eyes of humans Ingestion of licorice has been reported to cause transient visual loss 8 a possible consequence of retinal gap junction blockade Thus we considered the possible anticonvulsant effect of carbenoxolone in animal seizure models Results In pentylenetetrazole PTZ model ED50 values of diazepam and carbenoxolone were 1 13 mg kg 95 CL 0 89 1 44 and 283 3 mg kg 95 CL 144 27 556 29 respectively In PTZ model carbenoxolone increased the latency of seizures and decreased the duration of seizures dose dependently Table 1 In maximal electroshock MES model carbenoxolone 400 mg kg decreased the duration of tonic seizures This effect was not statistically significant in the lower doses of carbenoxolone This agent could not completely protect the mice against mortality in a dose of 400 mg kg Table 2 In the potentiation of pentobarbitone sleep test carbenoxolone significantly increased the sleeping time in mice at doses of 100 200 and 300 mg kg compared to controls dose dependently Table 3 Also carbenoxolone in doses of 100 200 and 300 mg kg decreased the latency compared to controls dose dependently and this effect was statistically significant Table 3 In the traction test carbenoxolone did not induce a muscle relaxant activity significantly up to a dose of 400 mg kg Carbenoxolone 400 mg kg showed muscle relaxant activity compared to normal saline and this effect was more than diazepam in a dose of 0 25 mg kg Table 4 In accelerod performances carbenoxolone in the first trial in doses of 100 200 and 300 mg kg showed a decline in motor function relative to normal saline 10 ml kg Table 5 The second trial carbenoxolone in doses of 200 and 300 mg kg decreased the riding time on rotarod compare to normal saline Table 5 Discussion Present results indicate that carbenoxolone has anticonvulsant activities in PTZ and MES models Agents affecting the PTZ model can inhibit petit mal seizure 9 Thus carbenoxolone may have activity on this kind of seizure Carbenoxolone also showed activity against MES This implies that carbenoxolone may have efficacy in grand mal seizure 9 Less is known about the effects of carbenoxolone on GJs although it has been proposed that glycyrrhetinic acid to which carbenoxolone is related binds directly to connexin molecules causing a conformational change leading to a closure of the junction 7 Modeling studies indicate that neuronal synchronization can be mediated by low densities of GJs either between dendrites as long as these dendrites are excitable 10 or between the axons of pyramidal cells 11 Furthermore the electrotonic coupling could be promoted during epileptogenesis 12 13 Optical imaging of neural activity evoked by electrical stimulation in the cultured rat suprachiasmatic nucleus SCN revealed that the spread of depolarization was inhibited by gap junction blockers halothane octanol but not by a blocker of voltage depended Na channels Depolarization propagation was also inhibited by muscimol a GABA A receptor agonist in a dose dependent manner and inhibition was reversed by bicuculline a GABA A receptor antagonist This indicated that the propagation of depolarization between SCN cells was inhibited by GABA A receptor activation There were two possible explanations for this result First GABA might affect the permeability of gap junction channels Secondly muscimol might increase the chloride conductance independent of gap junctions and might cause a decrease in the spread of depolarization Furthermore muscimol inhibited dye transfer between neurons in the SCN culture in a dose dependent fashion so that GABA might have reduced gap junction communication between SCN neurons via the GABAA receptor 14 In that study they could not clarify how the activation of a GABAA receptor and subsequent increase in chloride conductance impact gap junctions In studies it has been reported that increases in intracellular Ca 2or decreases in intracellular pH can uncouple cells 15 So they suggest that a participation of the GABA receptors in the regulation of Ca 2concentration or intracellular pH could explain the uncoupling effect of muscimol As a matter of fact it was suggested that the gap junction coupling state between neurons in SCN is not static but dynamically regulated by the GABA A receptor system 14 Also in vitro guinea pig brain preparation prolonged seizure like activity elicited using a brief application of bicuculline was abolished by the GJ channel blockers octanol and glycyrrhetinic acid as well as by intracellular acidification 16 It is suggested that carbenoxolone by blocking GJ channels inhibits both the induction and duration of epilepsy in the in vivo models of seizures From previous evidences we speculate that carbenoxolone by closing GJ channels possibly directly or via the GABAergic system inhibits the spread of depolarization waves in the CNS and peripheral organs These could explain the anticonvulsant muscle relaxant and hypnotic effects of carbenoxolone But further experiments need to establish this hypothesis At anticonvulsant doses carbenoxolone produced a hypnotic effect in the pentobarbitone sleep test and motor impairment in the rotarod test but only at a dose of 400 mg kg which had anticonvulsant effect did carbenoxolone show muscle relaxant activity in the traction test In the potentiation of pentobarbitone sleep test carbenoxolone significantly showed sedative effect Glycyrrhetinic acid is an aglycone saponin extracted from licorice root 7 and saponines have hypnotic effects 17 Carbenoxolone is also the succinyl ester of glycyrrhetinic acid Thus this can explain the sedative effect of carbenoxolone In the muscle coordination test carbenoxolone showed a muscle relaxant effect Synchronized firing is a widespread phenomenon in the mammalian brain 18 19 including the motor cortex 20 respiratory motor neurons 21 22 and limb motor neurons 23 24 These studies have demonstrated the presence of gap junctions in many levels of the motor system in both motor neurons and in premotor pattern generating circuits Further gap junction coupling GJC has brought about robust coordination patterns even in the absence of chemical synapses and has been shown to mediate synchronization of neurons during motor behaviors 25 On the other hand as yet there is no information about the effects of carbenoxolone in the muscle tissues therefore the possibility exists that these channels may be in muscles and synchronize the firing between muscle cells Carbenoxolone by blocking these channels causes motor impairment However a demonstration of whether these channels are in fact capable of mediating electrical transmission requires physiological experiments Thus we conclude that carbenoxolone has anticonvulsant muscle relaxant and hypnotic effects in the in vivo models possibly via blocking GJ channels The exact mechanism of these effects needs further investigation Materials and Methods Chemicals Carbenoxolone pentylenetetrazole and pentobarbitone were
