 Background Gene transfer into developing and mature primary T cells has been limited by the lack of efficient techniques for ex vivo or in vivo transfection or transduction The adaptation of retroviral vectors for gene delivery into lymphocytes has gained favor recently 1 2 but has several features that limit its use First retroviral gene transduction requires cell cycle progression of the cellular host to permit viral genome integration limiting studies of regulatory genes that are operative early in T cell activation or differentiation Second because the integration site of the viral genome is variable there can be local host chromatin effects on exogenous gene expression and unpredictable silencing of viral integrants Third efficiencies of transduction with retroviral vectors are often limiting Finally the retroviral genome is small limiting the size of exogenous genes that can be packaged Replication defective adenoviral vectors offer several advantages that make them attractive for gene delivery 3 4 5 6 Adenoviral vectors are able to transduce proliferating or quiescent cells they can accommodate dual large insert sizes and can deliver additional genes by superinfection and stable high titer viral stocks are easily generated 7 Further since the adenoviral genome is maintained extra chromosomally insertion site dependent effects of the host genome are minimized and exogenous genes can be reliably expressed at high levels Unfortunately naive lymphocytes are not susceptible to infection with adenoviruses due to lack of detectable expression of a viral receptor such as the coxsackie adenovirus receptor CAR which is required for efficient viral attachment 8 9 10 The CAR protein contains two extra cellular immunoglobulin like Ig domains the first of which appears sufficient for binding to the adenoviral fiber knob protein 11 12 Expression of either human or murine CAR in various cell lines has been shown to facilitate gene transfer by recombinant human adenoviruses 8 9 10 13 Stable transfection of transformed murine B and T cells lines with human CAR hCAR lacking its cytoplasmic domain rendered them susceptible to adenoviral transfection establishing that lymphoid cells can be permissive hosts for adenoviral transduction and demonstrating that the cytoplasmic domain of CAR is not required for viral entry 13 More recently mice transgenic for full length 14 or truncated hCAR 15 have been described in which adenoviral transduction of primary lymphocytes has been demonstrated We describe here three new transgenic Tg mouse lines in which expression of human CAR with a truncated cytoplasmic domain hCAR cyt is limited to thymocytes and lymphocytes under direction of a human CD2 mini gene 16 The three lines are similar in having transgene expression restricted to the lymphoid lineage but differ in the pattern of hCAR cyt expression profiles within lymphoid populations In each transgenic line expression of the hCAR cyt transgene imparted susceptibility to efficient adenoviral transduction that was independent of cellular activation By crossing the hCAR cyt CD2 Tg mice with DO11 10 TCR Tg mice we have generated an antigen specific model with which to study the effects of adenovirally delivered genes on T cell activation and differentiation Transduction of hCAR cyt positive na ve Th1 or Th2 DO11 10 T cells with a recombinant adenoviral vector resulted in high level reporter gene expression without detectable activation of transduced cells or deleterious effect on their antigenic responses Results hCAR cyt CD2 transgenic mice characterization of distinct hCAR expression profiles in three different founder lines To develop a transgenic model with high level expression of hCAR on murine T cells a transgene was constructed based on a human CD2 mini gene described previously 16 Fig 1A This mini gene includes the 5 promoter region of the hCD2 gene as well as the hCD2 LCR which is reported to direct transgene expression to T cells in a position independent copy number dependent manner 17 18 Since the function of CAR is undefined and deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of hCAR does not adversely affect adenoviral transduction 13 19 a cDNA encoding a cytoplasmic tail truncated variant of hCAR hCAR cyt was generated and inserted into the CD2 mini gene to eliminate any potential signaling capacity of hCAR Of eight founder mice bearing an intact transgene all demonstrated lymphoid lineage specific expression of hCAR cyt with three distinct expression profiles represented by founder lines 6 13 and 18 Figure 1Band data not shown To develop an antigen specific T cell system with which to deliver genes of interest each of these lines was then crossed with DO11 10 TCR Tg mice 20 to generate the DO11 hCAR cyt double transgenic lines shown Figure 1B 1C Lymph node cells were isolated from mice in DO11 hCAR cyt lines 6 13 and 18 stained with antibodies to CD4 CD8 CD19 and RmcB anti hCAR and analyzed by flow cytometry Fig 1B All of the CD4 and CD8 T cells from line 6 and 18 expressed high levels of the hCAR cyt transgene while CD4 and CD8 T cells from line 13 had a bimodal pattern of expression with approximately 35 of both CD4 and CD8 negative for hCAR cyt While both lines 13 and 18 had negligible expression in the B cell compartment the vast majority of B cells from line 6 expressed the hCAR cyt transgene although at a lower level than the T cells mean fluorescence intensity MFI CD19 B cells 64 CD4 T cells 193 hCAR cyt was not detected in non lymphoid tissues nor on lymphocytes from non transgenic littermate controls data not shown To determine at what developmental stage the hCAR cyt transgene is expressed in T cells thymocytes were isolated from 4 week old mice and the expression of hCAR cyt relative to the expression of CD4 and CD8 was evaluated Fig 1C Consistent with the expression of hCAR cyt on mature CD4 and CD8 T cells from lines 6 and 18 all of the thymocytes in the CD4 CD8 double positive DP and CD4 or CD8 single positive SP fractions were positive for hCAR cyt In line 13 approximately 68 of the DP and SP cells expressed hCAR cyt consistent with the expression of hCAR cyt on T cells in the periphery A lower percentage of hCAR cyt positive cells was observed in the CD4 CD8 double negative fraction in all lines studied which likely reflects the heterogeneous nature of the double negative population The skewed pattern of thymocyte development toward CD4 single positive in each of the lines was similar to that observed in DO11 10 hCAR cyt control littermates data not shown Thus in the three distinct lines studied the CD2 promoter LCR enhancer directed the expression of the hCAR cyt transgene to the T cell and in one of the lines the B cell lineage Line 18 was chosen for further study as the recipient of adenoviral mediated gene delivery due to its uniform T cell specific expression of the hCAR cyt transgene Primary T cells and thymocytes from DO11 hCAR cyt mice are efficiently transduced by adenoviral vectors To determine whether lymphocytes from hCAR cyt CD2 transgenic mice were susceptible to adenoviral transduction lymph node cells were isolated from line DO11 hCAR cyt 18 and incubated with adenoviral vectors designed to express GFP under the control of the CMV5 or ubiquitin UbP promoters Fig 2A Seventy percent of resting CD4 cells that were transduced with the Ad5 UbP GFP expressed the GFP reporter without activation In contrast only 36 of resting CD4 cells transduced with the Ad5 CMV5 GFP were GFP and the mean fluorescence intensity was lower suggesting an inability of the CMV5 promoter to induce strong GFP expression in resting T cells Following activation with PMA and ionomycin CMV5 driven expression of GFP increased to 81 of the CD4 T cells A small percentage of CD4 cells representing the hCAR cyt CD8 fraction were transduced with both the UbP and CMV5 viruses as well To determine whether adenoviral transduction changed their activation status resting CD4 T cells were examined for expression of the early activation markers CD62L L selectin and CD25 IL 2R After transduction with Ad5 UbP GFP or Ad5 CMV5 GFP without PMA ionomycin the GFP positive and the GFP negative fractions of CD4 cells were both CD62L high and CD25 low confirming that the cells were initially of a resting phenotype and that adenoviral transduction did not activate them Upon activation with PMA ionomycin the CD4 T cells down regulated CD62L and up regulated CD25 Fig 2A Control T cells from hCAR cyt transgene negative littermates had indistinguishable flow cytometric profile data not shown Because the expression of hCAR cyt was detected early in thymocyte development Fig 1C the ability of these cells to be transduced by adenovirus was also determined Thymocytes from line 18 were incubated with Ad5 UbP GFP as stated above and were evaluated by flow cytometry for their expression of CD4 CD8 and GFP Fig 2B Seventy five percent of the CD4 SP cells were transduced for GFP expression consistent with the transduction frequency of CD4 T cells in the periphery Approximately half of the CD8 SP could be transduced as well Interestingly whereas a high percentage of the DN thymocytes expressed GFP after transduction 75 the DP fraction was relatively refractory to transduction even though all of the DP cells expressed hCAR cyt less than 10 of the transduced DP cells were GFP positive irrespective of the MOI tested Fig 2Band data not shown Adenoviral transduction of Th1 and Th2 lines derived from DO11 hCAR cyt transgenic mice To examine the susceptibility of effector T cell populations to adenoviral transduction Th1 and Th2 cells were derived from DO11 hCAR cyt 18 mice by in vitro culture under polarizing cytokine conditions 21 The resulting Th1 and Th2 lines were incubated with Ad5 UbP GFP or Ad5 CMV5 GFP with or without activation with PMA ionomycin and expression of GFP was measured by flow cytometry 24 hours later Fig 3and Table 1 Similar to na ve T cells resting Th1 and Th2 cells were readily transduced by Ad5 UbP GFP and PMA ionomycin activation had little effect on either the frequency or expression levels of GFP positive cells In contrast both the frequencies and levels of GFP expression were increased in Ad5 CMV5 GFP transduced Th1 and Th2 lines following activation with PMA ionomycin anti CD3 or OVA peptide Further the activation induced expression of GFP by cells transduced with the Ad5 CMV5 vector yielded significantly better expression levels than those induced by the Ad5 UbP vector Thus both Th1 and Th2 effectors derived from DO11 hCAR cyt mice are competent hosts for adenoviral transduction and were equivalent to or better than na ve DO11 hCAR cyt cells with respect to their transduction efficiencies and or reporter expression levels Adenoviral transduction does not alter the functional responses or differentiative potential of primary T cells Although adenoviral transduction did not induce detectable activation of resting na ve CD4 T cells Figure 2 we wished to further determine whether transduction altered the activation induced functions of this population The proliferative responses and potential for Th1 and Th2 phenotype development were therefore examined following adenoviral transduction CD4 T cells isolated from DO11 hCAR cyt 18 mice were transduced with Ad5 UbP GFP and were sorted after 24 hours based on their expression of GFP The sorted cells were cultured with antigen presenting cells and increasing concentrations of OVA peptide for 3 days and then pulsed with 3H thymidine for 24 hours Figure 4Ashows that the GFP positive population of Ad transduced cells had a comparable proliferative response to the non transduced GFP negative cells across the entire antigen dose range Thus adenoviral transduction did not significantly affect primary CD4 T cell proliferation Transduced sorted GFP and GFP CD4 T cells were cultured under Th1 Th2 polarizing conditions and examined for cytokine production following re stimulation to determine potential effects of adenoviral transduction on effector phenotype development Figure 4B Following one week of polarization Th1 and Th2 cells were tested by ELISA for their ability to produce cytokines indicative of the two different T cell subsets Figure 4B Th1 and Th2 polarized cells from both the transduced GFP and non transduced GFP populations produced comparable amounts of Th1 specific IFN or Th2 specific IL 4 and IL 10 cytokines respectively Cytokine production by Th1 and Th2 polarized DO11 10 T cells from hCAR cyt negative littermate controls was not significantly different data not shown Thus neither hCAR expression nor adenoviral transduction alters the na ve T cell s potential for Th1 or Th2 phenotype development In vivo trafficking of Ad transduced CD4 T cells To further investigate the effects of adenoviral transduction on T cell biology and to examine the possibility that hCAR expression an Ig superfamily member of undetermined function might alter the in vivo distribution of transduced T cells we examined the tissue distribution of DO11 hCAR cyt T cells following adoptive transfer into BALB c recipients For these experiments we used line 13 DO11 hCAR cyt Tg mice that have a bimodal distribution of hCAR expression to provide an internal control sham transfection population CD4 cells were isolated from DO11 hCAR cyt 13 lymph and spleen cells and transduced with Ad5 UbP GFP Twenty four hours later transduced T cells were recovered and examined for GFP expression by flow cytometry prior to transfer of 5 10 6cells into each recipient mouse In a representative experiment shown in Figure 5 45 percent of the pre transfer CD4 cells expressed the clonotypic marker KJ 126 and of these cells 47 5 had been transduced for GFP expression Fig 5A top panel Forty eight hours after I V injection of the transduced DO11 hCAR cyt 13 or control DO11 10 cells recipient mice were sacrificed and secondary lymphoid tissues lymph nodes spleen and Peyer s patches were divided for detection of the transferred KJ1 26 and GFP T cells by flow cytometry Fig 5A lower panel or immuno histochemistry Fig 5B Flow cytometric analysis determined that the transferred population of Ad transduced cells from DO11 hCAR cyt Tg donors retained the pre transfer frequencies of GFP and GFP cells within the DO11 10 T cell CD4 KJ1 26 fraction and were equivalent to control DO11 10 cells with respect to the relative distribution between secondary lymphoid organs Fig 5A 5B data not shown Thus 51 5 of the recovered KJ1 26 positive cells isolated from pooled lymph nodes expressed GFP compared to a pre transfer frequency of 47 5 Similar results were obtained in recovered splenic tissues and at 72 and 96 hours post transfer data not shown There was an increase in the level of GFP reporter expression by Ad transduced cells in the interval between transfer and recovery pre transfer MFI 75 post transfer MFI 320 suggesting continued GFP transcription in vivo Thus there was no preferential loss or increase of the Ad transduced cells in vivo nor were there gross differences in trafficking to secondary lymphoid tissues To determine if adenoviral transduction or GFP reporter expression altered T cell trafficking to tissue microenvironments recovered lymphoid tissues were sectioned and processed for fluorescent microscopic analysis Figure 5Band Table 2 A double label immunofluorescent protocol was developed to permit in situ localization of GFP or KJ1 26 T cells and B220 B cells in fixed frozen tissue sections Figure 5B and data not shown Irrespective of the population of T cells transferred DO11 10 wild type control or Ad5 UbC GFP transduced DO11 hCAR cyt a similar distribution of KJ1 26 and GFP T cells was found within the secondary lymphoid tissue microenvironments In the spleen KJ1 26 or GFP cells were primarily located within the periarterial lymphoid sheaths PALS with fewer positive cells in the marginal zones and only scattered positive cells in the red pulp Table 2 Relatively few positive cells were detected within the B cell follicles although positive cells could be found in the PALS at the border with B cell follicles Similarly in lymph nodes and Peyer s patches the wild type and Ad transduced transgenic T cells localized primarily to paracortical T cell areas Collectively these data indicate that neither hCAR cyt or GFP expression nor adenoviral transduction affects survival or trafficking of adoptively transferred cells for at least 4 days in vivo Discussion The introduction of transgenic systems adapted to take advantage of adenoviral gene delivery technology offers an attractive adjunct to existing gene delivery strategies for studies of lymphocyte biology In an effort to facilitate gene transfer into primary lymphocytes we and others 14 15 have employed different strategies to engineer transgenic mice that express the human adenoviral receptor hCAR on murine lymphocytes Here we report the characterization of three new transgenic lines that express a cytoplasmic tail truncated hCAR under control of hCD2 gene regulatory elements and demonstrate their utility for gene transfer studies of primary T cells and thymocytes In agreement with previous studies using human CD2 mini gene expression cassette 16 17 18 the truncated hCAR transgene was expressed in all cells of the T cell lineage and except for transgenic line 6 hCAR cyt CD2 6 in which there was expression on mature B cells as well as T cells hCAR was not expressed by non T cells Importantly the expression of hCAR cyt by T cells was stable and high level at all stages of development from double negative thymocytes to Th1 and Th2 effectors With the possible exception of double positive thymocytes see below reporter expression by transduced hCAR cyt positive cells at each of these developmental stages was very efficient Thus it is possible to target adenoviral transduction to the T cell compartment in vitro and in vivo Of particular note the level of expression of hCAR cyt was not significantly lower for double negative and double positive thymocyte populations in line hCAR cyt CD2 18 mice contrary to what was observed previously 15 The high level expression of hCAR cyt by double negative CD4 CD8 thymocytes rendered this population readily transducible suggesting that these early thymocytes express sufficient integrin co receptors e g v 3 or v 5 for adenoviral entry and making this a useful model for early thymocyte gene targeting Despite expression of levels of hCAR cyt comparable to that of double negative and single positive thymocytes double positive thymocytes were relatively refractory to reporter expression following transduction with either the Ad5 UbP GFP or Ad5 CMV5 GFP vector The lack of reporter expression could reflect poor entry of adenovirus in this population or poor transcriptional activity of the promoters used UbP and CMV5 among other possibilites Given the comparable levels of hCAR cyt expression by double positive and double negative or single positive thymocytes it is unlikely that viral entry is limiting in these cells although this has not been formally tested We favor the possibility that the poor reporter expression reflects inefficient transcriptional activity of these promoters at this developmental stage In this same vein expression of the GFP reporter by freshly isolated mature T cells transduced with the Ad5 UbP GFP vector was very efficient while the Ad5 CMV5 GFP vector required a post transduction activation of T cells to induce optimal expression of GFP 14 15 On the contrary the CMV5 promoter yielded better reporter expression in activated transduced Th1 and Th2 cells Thus the choice of promoter will need to be optimized for each adenoviral vector depending on the developmental stage and specific purpose for its use Studies with other promoter elements e g CD2 are in progress and should be informative Interestingly the bimodal pattern of transgene expression by T cells and thymocytes from line hCAR cyt CD2 13 suggested some positional effect variegation PEV of the transgene an effect not previously reported in trangenes that include the entire CD2 LCR 17 18 Further we have noticed that the percentage of hCAR cyt positive T cells in the line hCAR cyt CD2 13 increased with successive generations of back cross of the original hCAR cyt founder B6xSJL F1 onto a BALB c background reflecting a strain background effect of the PEV data not shown Although the mechanism of this expression heterogeneity is not clear it is fortuitous in providing different lines that offer distinct targeting profiles Accordingly it should prove possible to target both B and T cells in line hCAR cyt CD2 6 mice whereas line hCAR cyt CD2 13 mice can be exploited to perform transduction studies in which there is an hCAR cyt negative population to serve as an internal control Figure 5 An important consideration at the outset of these studies concerned the possibility that ectopic hCAR expression or adenoviral transduction might affect the normal development and or function of T cells For this reason we chose to use a truncated variant of hCAR to preclude possible signaling by this molecule 13 As evidenced by the functional data reported herein and those from previous reports 14 15 there does not appear to be an adverse effect of either hCAR cyt expression or adenoviral transduction on T cell activation development or function The antigen induced proliferative responses of na ve DO11 hCAR cyt T cells were comparable to those of non hCAR DO11 10 littermates and the differentiative potential of transduced na ve T cells into Th1 or Th2 effectors was not compromised While at higher multiplicities of adenoviral infection MOIs than those required for efficient transduction there were deleterious effects on na ve T cell viability data not shown at the MOIs used we saw no decrease in cell viability or function Further adenoviral transduction of resting na ve T cells exerted no detectable intrinsic activation of these cells suggesting that adenoviral delivery of genes of interest to non cycling T cells will permit loss or gain of function studies prior to antigen or mitogen driven stimulation Ad transduced DO11 hCAR cyt trafficked normally to secondary lymphoid organs following adoptive transfer indicating that neither hCAR cyt nor adenoviral transduction altered normal in vivo migration patterns This affords the opportunity to examine the in vivo responses of transduced na ve or effector T cells following ex vivo gene transfer Limitations in previous studies of in vivo adenoviral transduction have been the poor stability of adenoviral transduction in dividing cells and the induction of cytotoxic immune responses to adenoviral gene products We observed no decrement in GFP expression by adoptively transferred cells as long as 4 days following transfer data not shown but have not yet examined later time points Wan et al reported accelerated loss of Ad transduced cells relative to controls via an immune mediated mechanism 15 suggesting limitations for long term adoptive transfer studies into immune competent recipients It is unclear at present how immune responses to Ad transduced T cells might affect their in vivo function but the ability to examine early in vivo responses following adoptive transfers for even 3 4 days should prove valuable and transfers into immune deficient recipients should facilitate long term in vivo studies Further continued advances in the development of gutless adenoviral vectors that avoid expression of cytotoxic antigenic targets may alleviate immune clearance problems 22 23 24 Conclusions The hCAR cyt CD2 transgenic lines reported here offer unique properties that will be advantageous for many T cell transduction studies These models offer several advantages over existing approaches for short term gene delivery into primary T cells principal of which is the capacity for high efficiency transduction of T cells in G0 or G1 of cell cycle The introduction of the hCAR cyt CD2 transgene into TCR transgenic lines such as the DO11 10 model reported here will provide a powerful system for T cell developmental studies Due to their high immunogenicity and their extra chromosomal replication the current adenoviral vectors may not be appropriate for long term transduction in vivo but improvement in vector design and adoptive transfer into immunodeficient hosts may facilitate experiments in the future The development of newer recombinant adenoviruses containing elements for epichromosomal replication may alleviate limitations that prevent more stable in vivo expression in dividing lymphoid cells
