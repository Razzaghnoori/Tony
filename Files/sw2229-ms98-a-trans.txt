 do you are you on a regular regular exercise program right now yes and i hate it how about you oh well i m kind of off and on off and on well i guess i ve been kind of off and on i ve um right now i m kind of off had some health problems that have led me to uh stay more on than off okay what type of exercise do you do uh i do walking on the treadmill and then i do low impact aerobics okay i guess you don t enjoy that very much not not really you find that uh to be boring yeah yeah and time consuming i mean it s it s not just the exercise that s boring and time consuming it s uh you know afterwards you know then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up you know yeah well i m trying to get back in shape for softball this spring i know you go through this this is something you go through like every year but i yeah i haven t decided whether you re whether i wanna play yet or not i just bought myself a solo flex machine i don t know if you ve seen those advertised on TV hum um it s one of those uh universal type machines exercise machine but i haven t really sat down and used it much yet so it s collecting dust right now yeah a lot of things do that i have a negative i had an exercise bike i used to have one and finally got rid of it because i never used it but i do use my treadmill i used to jog somewhat uh huh well that s good yeah my parents have a treadmill it s when i go visit them uh i ll get on that thing every now and then yeah it s nice because when the weather s bad you can t you don t have any excuse um hum no i just got the bicycle out today and it was real nice outside had to get out to do something yeah i can t ride a bike so i been sitting in here uh in the house all weekend with a cold so i thought i d better uh better get outside and do something and not waste the day oh yeah it s too nice been too nice of a weekend but uh yeah i need to start jogging again i ve always found that to be uh uh really one of the best forms of exercise but it s terribly boring and so i really don t ever keep a a program up consistently uh you had any injuries from jogging no i never have well i don t jog enough i think to develop any injuries i usually only go about a mile or two i guess what worries me about jogging is that i hear that it s very hard on your body and and that you know you can end up getting hurt worse yeah it s it s tough on the joints if you jog on concrete or on asphalt supposed to be much better if you find uh grass or or uh dirt to jog on um hum yeah that s not quite so so easy yeah yeah have to have the right type of uh shoes too that s very important i found that true especially for walking on toes or fronts but yeah i don t have to buy jogging shoes all too often mine don t get very much use well i guess mine breakdown about they say about every six months uh huh so ah i usually enjoy the exercise i do but uh like i said i m just not very consistent about maintaining a a program so i ll i ll bicycle i get into that for for a little while and maybe go out and uh on a consistent basis every couple a days and ride a bike for awhile but then i ll get tired of doing that and maybe start jogging again and go out three or four nights a week but uh that gets old too in a very short order i m i m hoping that this uh solo flex will uh yeah uh change things a little bit i really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis yeah well don t let it collect dust you least exercise while dusting it off yeah well so maybe if i can get interested in playing softball again this spring i can uh start some type of uh regular program yeah that that ll be good i ve always found that that when you write things down and set goals it s a lot easier to keep uh keep something going um hum uh when i was in high school we had a choice of uh taking uh physical education courses on exercise and uh one of those involved a six week session on a universal machine lifting weights and uh working out like that oh and that was very helpful and we kept charts of our progress and uh consistently uh increased the amount of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks um hum i found that to be uh very helpful so are you gonna do that uh i need to i haven t started yet but it s a thought well that sounds like something good to do then sounds like something i should do yeah nice way to start off the spring uh huh get back in shape how often do you uh uh go out each week on your walking well i do i switch every other day one day i walk and one day i do the aerobics okay how far about how far do you go walking well i m trying build up my tolerance now i just surgery um less than two months ago and right now i m just a little over about a mile and a half but i try try to workup to three miles okay yeah that s good well they say that walking is just as good if not better than jogging yeah it takes it s just that it takes longer to get the same effect yeah but it sure well if you keep up a a consistent pace just to keep the heart rate going uh my walkman broke so i m upset now i just have to turn the stereo up real loud yeah yeah but it s a lot less stressful on the joints than jogging is yeah it is and it this has an you know my treadmill has an incline and you know you can get a really good workout on it um hum do you go to an aerobics class or do you watch on TV no i i just do it on TV i have a cassette okay which uh shows do you watch on TV um it s just a it s a tape i use tapes oh okay okay like a Kathy Smith workout or Jane Fonda Richard or Richard Simmons Sweating to the Oldies okay right i will every every now and then i ll watch uh ESPN i i get cable on TV and they have uh a couple of shows called Basic Training and um what is the other o ne called uh huh there was one guy i used to watch on ESPN i don t know if he s still on it anymore or not i don t i don t know if i get ESPN or not uh huh but um well yeah i used to watch one watch one on the air but that was back Bodies In Motion that s that s the name of the one i was thinking of that was yeah with Gil Janklowicz yeah yeah i watched that cause he was cute yeah well he s he s he he he s not bad and his assistants usually aren t either but uh they re always in in in Hawaii someplace on on the on the beach yeah yeah but then that was back when um you know the high impact and yeah well they they do low impact stuff now they re on everyday do they are they yeah okay they re so they re still he s still doing it then huh oh i ll have to tune in yeah every morning it s on ESPN uh at what time i can t remember what time it s uh well i can t remember offhand what time i ll have to check it check check it back up then but the thing is is everybody always looks so good on there show least on some of the other ones not everybody has a picture perfect body they have that show on yeah every now and then um hum well i found that they they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on TV i haven t watched any other ones on TV um just on some of the tapes so they re on weekdays at eleven o clock everyday Monday through Friday i ll have to okay thanks case you re interested in that i actually taped a few of the sessions that they had on there but uh i haven t done so much as uh watch the tape that i made now that s a thought well that s a thought i hadn t thought about doing that so i m kind of bad about that myself well they re gonna beep us pretty soon okay well i sure enjoyed talking to you about uh exercise and fitness uh huh nice talking to you okay thanks talk to you later bye so all right good night bye
