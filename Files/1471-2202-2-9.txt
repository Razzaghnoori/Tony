 Background It previously was believed that axonal growth within white matter was not possible This belief was based on the well documented failure of injured axons to regenerate within the central nervous system CNS 1 and reinforced by studies showing that neurons attach poorly to white matter in vitro 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 These studies in part supported the hypothesis that CNS myelin contains axon growth inhibiting molecules Additional investigations identified myelin associated molecules including Nogo formerly NI 35 250 myelin associated glycoprotein MAG and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans that inhibit neurite growth 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Early studies in which transplanted embryonic neurons extended parallel axons within white matter appeared to be inconsistent with this hypothesis 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 However successful growth was attributed to the possibility that embryonic neurons may not express receptors for myelin associated inhibitors 26 28 29 30 Recent studies however demonstrated that white matter can support extensive parallel axonal growth from transplanted adult neurons 31 32 Recent tissue section culture experiments also demonstrated that white matter can support parallel neurite growth 33 Given the growing evidence that white matter can support axonal growth we sought to identify the properties that mediate its parallel orientation Physical edges and contours haptotactic cues can guide axonal growth independently of biochemical composition 34 Physical edges arranged in parallel within white matter such as astroglial processes and axons could theoretically guide parallel neurite growth Alternatively biochemical cues may guide parallel growth Cryostat sections of rat brain were manipulated to deactivate biochemical guidance cues while preserving haptotactic cues and were then used as substrata for cultured neurons These manipulations included prior fixation or mounting on polyornithine coated culture dishes and in both cases non parallel neurite growth occurred on white matter suggesting that biochemical cues are required for parallel growth Additional experiments assessed the contribution of myelin to the parallel orientation of neurites The orientation of neurites on myelin deficient corpus callosum was assessed Also neurons were cultured with cAMP analogs or preincubated with nerve growth factor NGF treatments known to attenuate the overall inhibitory effects of myelin 35 36 Neurites extending on myelin deficient corpus callosum or from neurons that were preincubated with NGF or treated with cAMP analogs were significantly less parallel These results suggest that myelin contributes to the parallel orientation of neurite growth on white matter and that this effect may be mediated by its overall neurite inhibitory properties Results Neurite growth on the corpus callosum As previously reported 33 neurites extending on the corpus callosum near the midline and medial to the cingulum were mostly limited to orientations that were in parallel with the longitudinal axis of the fiber tract Neurites also extended on more lateral portions of the corpus callosum but these neurites extended in all directions including perpendicular orientations Neurites on lateral portions of the fiber tract could also be commonly observed extending from white matter onto gray matter whereas those medial to the cingulum were generally confined to the fiber tract As it is difficult to assess the orientation of the underlying corpus callosum laterally analysis of neurite orientiation relative to the underlying tract was restricted to portions of the corpus callosum medial to the cingulum Neurons attached in varying densities under all conditions but neurite orientation was not dramatically affected by neuronal density Neurite orientation is qualitatively best demonstrated by high density cultures Consequently the photomicrographs presented in the following results are generally of higher density cultures However since it is difficult to follow a single neurite from soma to growth cone in the case of high neuronal densities the quantitative results presented herein were derived from all assessible neurons from cases where low rates of attachment occurred Haptotaxis appears insufficient to mediate the parallel orientation of neurites In order to deactivate biochemical guidance cues while preserving haptotactic cues that may guide parallel neurite growth brain sections were fixed prior to use as substrata for cultured neurons After 39 hours in culture many neurons had attached to the corpus callosum of both fixed and unfixed tissue sections and extended short neurites freely on these fiber tracts On the corpus callosum in unfixed sections the neurites were oriented mostly in parallel with the longitudinal axis of the tract as has been previously shown 33 In contrast on fixed sections neurite growth occurred in all directions on the corpus callosum In fact neurite growth often occurred in directions perpendicular to the tract After 3 days in culture neurites continued to extend freely on both fixed and unfixed sections On the unfixed corpus callosum scattered neurons continued to extend neurites parallel to the tract forming dense plexi of neurites attached firmly to the underlying substrate On the fixed corpus callosum however many of the neurons had migrated together forming small clusters that extended neurites in all directions across the fiber tract Many of these neurites grew in close association appearing to use each other as a substrate While the growth cones of these neurites remained firmly attached to the underlying substrate the proximal segments often detached from the substrate and straightened under the tension applied by the outward migrating growth cone After one week in culture dense parallel plexi of firmly attached neurites were found on the unfixed corpus callosum Fig 1A Neurites extending on the fixed corpus callosum Fig 1B formed a web of loosely attached neurites radiating in all directions across the fiber tract Quantification of neurite orientation showed a significant difference between those extending on fixed and unfixed corpus callosum Since the results were essentially the same regardless of the length of time that the neurons were cultured Figure 2shows the mean orientations for neurites assessed after culture durations of 39 hours to 7 days To assure that these values reflected neurites in contact with the underlying tissue section rather than neurites growing on each other only the orientations of neurites that extended in isolation from other neurites were assessed In addition to a significantly greater p 0 0001 mean angular deviation from an orientation that is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tract the variance in the deviation on fixed corpus callosum was significantly greater than that on unfixed corpus callosum F 100 289 1 541 p 0 01 This is consistent with the interpretation that neurites are free to grow in a wider range of orientations on fixed white matter As documented previously 33 explants of sympathetic ganglia attached to corpus callosum in unfixed sections mounted on untreated culture dishes exhibited neurite outgrowth halos that were oriented in parallel with the underlying tract Fig 1E However when sections were mounted on polyornithine coated culture dishes a manipulation also designed to mask chemical cues but not haptotactic interactions between growing neurites and the underlying substrate neurite outgrowth was found to radiate in all orientations without preference for the longitudinal axis of the fiber tract Fig 1F Myelin may contribute to the parallel orientation of neurites The corpus callosum of myelin deficient md rats was difficult to distinguish from gray matter when viewed using phase contrast optics data not shown and was clearly less myelinated when labelled using Rip immunohistochemistry Fig 3A B and Luxol Fast Blue histochemistry data not shown GFAP immunohistochemistry showed hypertrophy of astroglia within the md fiber tracts compared with wild type Wt tracts as has been previously reported 37 However the orientation of GFAP immunoreactivity was mostly in parallel with the longitudinal axis of both md and Wt fiber tracts Fig 3C D To determine whether the absence of myelin affects the rate and orientation of neurite growth neurons were cultured on sections of md forebrain and Wt forebrain matched for age P21 and genetic background Wistar Neurite length and orientation were assessed after 7 days in culture The orientation of neurite growth on Wt corpus callosum Fig 3E was clearly more parallel compared with that on md corpus callosum Fig 3F In addition the density of neuronal attachment and neurite growth appeared to be greater on md corpus callosum and neurites extending on gray matter were less inhibited at borders with the md corpus callosum Fig 3F A quantitative comparison of neurites on md and Wt corpus callosum showed that they did not differ in length Fig 4A p 0 63 However a comparison of the mean deviation from an orientation parallel to the longitudinal axis of the fiber tract showed that neurites on md corpus callosum were significantly less parallel compared with those on Wt corpus callosum Fig 4B p 0 0001 Moreover the variance in the orientation on md corpus callosum was significantly greater than that on Wt corpus callosum F 114 131 1 452 p 0 05 consistent with the interpretation that neurites are free to grow in a wider range of orientations on the md fiber tract Interestingly neurite growth on P21 Wt corpus callosum appeared less constrained to a parallel orientation than that normally seen on white matter in sections of adult Wt brain compare Figure 4B Wt with Figure 5Band 6A Bcontrols Myelin associated inhibitors may contribute to parallel neurite growth Preincubation of neurons with high concentrations of neurotrophins for 5 to 24 hours blocks the neurite growth inhibitory effects of myelin 35 Therefore neurons were preincubated with nerve growth factor NGF 200 ng ml for 21 hours prior to plating on sections of adult forebrain Neurite length and orientation were assessed after 3 days of culture No difference in neurite length was detectable between neurons that had been preincubated with NGF and control neurons that had been preincubated for the same length of time in culture medium without NGF Fig 5A p 0 10 However the mean deviation of neurites from an orientation parallel to the longitudinal axis of the corpus callosum from neurons that had been preincubated with NGF was significantly greater than that of control neurons Fig 5B p 0 05 Moreover the variance in neurite orientation from neurons that had been preincubated with NGF was significantly greater than that of control neurons F 74 131 1 805 p 0 01 The NGF was biologically active as it substantially increased neurite growth from sympathetic explants cultured on polyornithine coated dishes data not shown Treatment with cAMP analogs has also been shown to block the inhibitory effects of myelin on neurite growth 35 36 Therefore neurons were cultured on sections of adult forebrain in the presence of dibutyryl cAMP db cAMP 1 mM and the effects on neurite growth were assessed after 3 to 7 days in culture Interestingly the length of neurites was significantly decreased by db cAMP data not shown Assessment of neurite orientation showed a significant increase in deviation from a parallel orientation on the corpus callosum compared with medium treated control cultures Fig 6A p 0 05 An increased variance in neurite orientation in db cAMP treated cultures also occurred F 153 119 1 318 p 0 05 Discussion The contributions of biochemical and haptotactic cues to parallel neurite growth Several biochemical factors influence axonal growth by either attraction or repulsion and may guide axonal growth by hemming in the growth cone to a channel containing permissive molecules surrounded by repulsive molecules 38 39 For example this mechanism may explain somite mediated segmentation of developing motor axons 40 41 Mechanical haptotactic cues can also guide neurites Early theories proposed that neurites extend in the direction of least resistance reviewed by Ram n y Cajal 1 Harrison proposed that haptotaxis guides neurites along fibrin threads in tissue culture 34 He also noted that developing peripheral nerves grow through the notches between the muscle plates the nerves follow definite paths which are preformed by the configuration of other organs Grooves between the more solid embryonic organs seem to be paths of predilection 34 Grooves etched into plastic or glass also guide neurites 42 43 Tissue sections supported neuronal attachment and neurite growth on gray and white matter despite prior fixation However neurites did not extend in parallel on fixed corpus callosum By cross linking proteins fixation should interfere with biochemical contact guidance cues without altering the edges and contours that could act as haptotactic cues In fact the histology of the sections was preserved after fixation compare Figures 1Cand 1D when viewed with phase contrast optics which depends on refraction and diffraction indicating that the edges and contours were not altered Nevertheless the resolution afforded by light microscopy is insufficient to rule out the possibility that fixation altered surface contours thereby contributing to the loss of parallel orientation The polyornithine experiments provide additional evidence that haptotaxis is insufficient to guide parallel growth Whether polyornithine acted through the tissue section and or reentered solution secondarily depositing onto the sections is not clear Either way it is unlikely that polyornithine altered the topology of the sections to mask haptotactic cues in the same manner that would have occurred through fixation Therefore taken together the effects of fixation and polyornithine suggest that haptotactic cues are insufficient to guide parallel neurite growth It is likely that several biochemical guidance cues exist in white matter including not only repulsive molecules e g Nogo or MAG but also growth permissive molecules e g laminin It is possible that only a subset of them are blocked by either fixation or polyornithine and it is not possible to determine which of these factors have been blocked in our experiments especially since many of these factors may not be known Therefore if parallel neurite growth had been observed on fixed corpus callosum or on corpus callosum in sections mounted on polyornithine it would not have been possible to interpret the data with regard to the relative contributions of biochemical guidance cues and haptotaxis However since the parallel growth constraint was eliminated under these conditions it is clear that the relevant biochemical cues were blocked To the extent that these biochemical cues but not haptotactic cues were blocked by fixation or mounting on polyornithine these data suggest that haptotaxis is insufficient to account for the parallel orientation The fact that the neurite outgrowth was more fasciculated points to the possibility that growth promoting and or adhesive factors were also affected by the treatments Therefore the loss of parallel growth could be attributed to the loss of either positive or negative cues or both that normally serve to align neurite outgrowth The contribution of myelin to parallel neurite growth White matter is replete with parallel oriented cells that could provide biochemical orienting cues for growing axons e g non reactive astrocytes 31 32 Alternatively given their tendency to fasciculate axons could provide a permissive parallel substrate However for white matter to have an orienting influence there must also be a relatively non permissive substrate that restricts growing axons to a parallel course Myelin associated inhibitors are obvious candidates for this role To test the contribution of myelin neurons were cultured on sections of myelin deficient md brain Neurites on md corpus callosum were significantly less parallel than those on wild type Wt corpus callosum Since deviation from parallelism is restricted to the range of values from 0 to 90 where 0 indicates strict parallelism and 90 indicates perpendicularity randomly oriented neurites would have a mean deviation approaching 45 In fact the mean deviation from parallelism on md corpus callosum was 38 9 These data suggest that myelin contributes to the parallel orientation of axons on white matter Interestingly neurites on P21 Wt corpus callosum were less parallel than those on adult Wt corpus callosum possibly because of incomplete myelination at P21 Neurite lengths on md and Wt corpus callosum did not differ The absence of myelin associated neurite growth inhibitors might have been expected to increase neurite growth on md corpus callosum However myelin mediated inhibition has mostly been studied under conditions in which the organization of myelin was disrupted 10 11 13 14 15 16 17 18 44 45 There is little evidence that myelin associated inhibitors reduce neurite growth when maintained in their normal geometric organization In fact neurites extending in parallel on corpus callosum in vitro are comparable in length to those on gray matter 33 It is possible that demyelination affects other properties that affect neurite orientation For example hypertrophy of astrocytes and axonal swellings have been reported in the white matter of these animals 37 In fact the axons and astrocytes appear to remain oriented mostly in parallel Thus the possibility that alterations in astrocytic morphology or other changes in the tissue contribute to the reduced parallel outgrowth cannot be ruled out However when these data are taken in combination with the reduced parallel neurite growth from neurons preincubated with NGF or treated with cAMP analogs conditions known to interfere with the overall inhibitory effects of myelin on neurite growth see discussion below there appears to be a preponderance of data suggesting that the loss of myelin is directly responsible for the reduced parallel orientation of neurite growth The contribution of myelin associated inhibitors to parallel neurite growth To test whether myelin associated neurite inhibitors are involved conditions known to block myelin associated inhibitory activity were used Since the parallel growth constraint may be due to the combined action of multiple inhibitors treatments that are known to attenuate the overall inhibitory properties of myelin were selected Priming neurons with NGF or treatment with db cAMP reduced the parallel constraint on growth Together these data suggest that myelin associated neurite growth inhibitory activity may contribute to the parallel constraint on growth in white matter but do not necessarily implicate specific inhibitors since priming with neurotrophins and treatment with cAMP analogs inactivate the inhibitory activity of myelin as a whole 35 36 Whether the test neurons used in this study are responding to specific factors that have been previously identified such as MAG and NoGo is unknown It is possible that other myelin associated inhibitors exist and contribute to parallel neurite orientation 15 Do myelin associated inhibitors influence the orientation of neurite growth in vivo MAG is reportedly expressed only at the interface between axons and their myelin sheaths 12 If so MAG is not accessible to axons extending within myelinated tracts without disruption of the myelin sheaths Nogo in contrast is expressed on the outer surface of myelin sheaths 46 and is therefore accessible to axons extending within uninjured fiber tracts In fact infusion of the Nogo inactivating IN 1 Fab fragment into the vermis of the rat cerebellum induced sprouting of uninjured Purkinje cell axons suggesting that Nogo normally constrains the growth and orientation of axons 47 A role of Nogo in restricting the orientation of neurite growth is further supported by studies showing that IN 1 sensitive inhibitors expressed in the already myelinated sensory tracts of the rat spinal cord appeared to restrict the position of developing corticospinal axons 48 A limitation of tissue section culture is that it accounts for only two of the three dimensions normally present in vivo However the intent of this study was to examine the role of the parallel array of tissue elements in regulating axonal growth and the two dimensional sections can be viewed as a sampling of this three dimensional parallel geometry It also cannot be ruled out that by sectioning the fiber tract as is done in tissue section culture that intracellular molecules may be exposed artifactually The striking similarity to the parallel axonal growth within white matter observed from transplanted neurons in vivo 20 21 22 23 26 28 29 31 32 however makes it unlikely that the pattern of neurite growth in tissue section culture is entirely due to artifactual unmasking of normally sequestered molecules or to a limitation in the available degrees of freedom The correspondence between the orientation of neurite growth in this assay and that observed in vivo indicates that tissue section culture models the relevant tissue properties and geometry Conclusions These data suggest that the orienting influence of white matter geometry on neurite outgrowth involves myelin and possibly its associated neurite growth inhibitory activity The term inhibitor refers to the effects of myelin on neurites in studies that did not consider its normal geometric organization within white matter In fact close to the site of injury where its geometry is disrupted myelin may indeed be an obstacle to regeneration see Pettigrew et al companion paper http www biomedcentral com 1471 2202 2 8 It is now clear however that the presence alone of undisrupted myelin is insufficient to prevent regeneration 31 32 While the direct effect of myelin on growing axons in vitro is inhibitory but does little to block axonal growth within intact tracts in vivo myelin may nevertheless play an important role in regulating axonal growth within intact tracts Myelin may encourage directed long distance growth by restricting it to a parallel orientation For example in the spinal cord where successful regeneration ultimately depends on axon extension in an appropriate direction over long distances factors that promote parallel axonal growth and discourage non parallel growth should enhance long distance regeneration In fact several studies have been succesful in promoting axonal regeneration across sites of spinal cord or optic nerve injury by blocking the myelin associated inhibitor Nogo 16 45 49 However these axons often fail to reattain a parallel orientation within the distal stump These axons followed an irregular course and branching was seen quite frequently The inhibitory activity of myelin may actually serve to promote axonal growth in an intact fiber tract such as the distal stump of the injured spinal cord by restricting this growth to an orientation that is parallel to the fiber tract while discouraging local meandering and collateral sprouting Materials and Methods Preparation of substrata Adult Sprague Dawley rats maintained in the University of Cincinnati vivarium in accordance with the NIH guide for the care of research animals were deeply anesthetized using 4 ml kg i p pentobarbital sodium solution 50 mg ml Abbott Laboratories North Chicago IL and decapitated The brains were rapidly removed and frozen at 80 C In other cases myelin deficient md and wild type Wt control brains Wistar supplied by Dr Judith Grinspan Dept of Research Neurology Children s Hospital Philadelphia PA were used age 21 days Brains were cut using a cryostat and four to sixteen micron thick coronal sections were thaw mounted onto either untreated or 0 05 poly DL ornithine Sigma St Louis MO Catalog No P 8638 coated 35 mm diameter plastic culture dishes Fisher Scientific Springfield NJ Catalog No 1008 and kept at 20 C until plating with cells 2 to 4 hours later In some cases after mounting onto untreated culture dishes the sections were post fixed with 10 formalin for 30 to 45 minutes at 4 C and rinsed three times with Ham s F12 medium Sigma Control sections were treated for the same length of time at the same temperature with Ham s F12 medium rather than formalin Tissue culture Lumbar sympathetic chain ganglia were dissected from embryonic day 10 Leghorn chicken embryos Spafas Inc Boston MA in Ham s F12 medium In some cases the sympathetic chain ganglia were further dissected into explants area 3 000 to 45 000 m 2 using a Bard Parker scalpel fitted with a No 10 blade These explants were seeded either onto 0 05 poly DL ornithine coated 35 mm diameter plastic culture dishes or onto the prepared tissue sections In other cases the sympathetic chain ganglia were incubated with 0 25 trypsin Sigma for 20 minutes at 37 C Trypsinization was subsequently blocked by exposure to 100 heat inactivated fetal bovine serum FBS Harlan Bioproducts for Science Inc Indianapolis IN for 5 minutes and the tissue was washed 2 times with serum free Ham s F12 medium The tissue was then dissociated by gentle trituration using flamed Pasteur pipets Fisher Catalog No 13 678 6A and the cell suspension was seeded onto the prepared tissue sections All cultures were grown in serum free Neurobasal medium 2 ml per dish supplemented with B27 Gibco BRL Grand Island NY 50 1 v v 0 5 mM L glutamine Sigma and 100 units ml penicillin streptomycin Gibco Catalog No 15140 015 Cultures were grown for 39 hours to 7 days in a humidified environment at 37 C and 6 CO 2 Treatments Some suspensions of neurons were preincubated at 37 C with 200 ng ml nerve growth factor NGF Harlan product code BT 5017 for 21 hours prior to plating Control suspensions were preincubated in Neurobasal medium for 21 hours at 37 C Bioactivity of the NGF was confirmed by culturing explants of sympathetic chain ganglia on polyornithine coated dishes with or without 25 ng ml NGF and assessing the extent of neurite outgrowth after 6 days Some cultures were established with 1 mM dibutyryl cAMP db cAMP Calbiochem San Diego CA Catalog No 28745 and were retreated with 1 mM db cAMP every other day Control cultures were treated with equal volumes of Neurobasal medium Evaluation of neurite growth and substrate anatomy After 39 hours to 7 days in culture all media were removed and replaced with Ham s F12 medium Each dish was treated with 2 5 ng ml of 5 carboxyfluorescein diacetate acetoxymethyl ester vital dye Molecular Probes Eugene OR for 45 to 90 minutes at 37 C Subsequently all media were removed and replaced with fresh Ham s F12 medium The cultures were then visualized using a Nikon Diaphot fluorescent microscope with a fluorescein filter and a 4x or 10x objective Substrate histology was visualized using phase contrast optics or by immunohistochemically labelling glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP In the latter case the cultures were incubated with a Cy3 conjugated monoclonal antibody raised against porcine GFAP 1 400 Sigma Product No C9205 simultaneously with labelling of the neurons with vital dye GFAP immunoreactivity was visualized using the same microscope with a rhodamine filter Photomicrographs were captured with a Nikon 35 mm camera In other cases digital images were captured to a Power Macintosh microcomputer with a Data Translation framegrabber card and electronically enhanced to increase contrast Quantification of neurite length and orientation The orientation and spatial extent of the corpus callosum in sections used as substrata were first assessed using phase contrast or GFAP immunoreactivity The orientation of the tract was measured by drawing a line parallel to its edges and measuring the angle of this line using NIH Image 1 60 software The spatial extent of the tract was marked by tracing around the perimeter of the visible tract using the polygon tool Three subregions of the corpus callosum were analyzed separately the horizontal segment at the midline and the two segments oriented at roughly 45 angles from points just lateral to the horizontal midline segment to the dorsal callosal apex immediately ventral to the widest portion of the cingulum More lateral portions of the corpus callosum were avoided because of the difficulty in assessing the orientation of their composing fibers Both the orientation of the tract and its spatial extent were recorded by an NIH Image macro program custom made for this analysis This image was then closed and replaced by an image of the same field showing the neurons and their neurites but not the anatomy of the section Neurite length and orientation were then assessed A neuron was included for analysis only if its neurite did not form fascicles with other neurites and if it was possible to visually follow the entire length of the neurite Neurites located on the curved flexures between the previously described 3 segments of the corpus callosum were avoided since it is difficult to assign a fixed orientation to the underlying corpus callosum Neurite length was assessed by tracing the neurite using the straight line tool in NIH Image The net length i e the straight line distance between the cell body and growth cone was measured in pixels and then converted to micrometers using a known physical standard From vector arithmetic we know that this distance is the weighted by segment length average of the orientations of each of the segments along the total length of the neurite The macro program automatically determined whether the neuronal cell body was located within the polygon delimited spatial extent of the fiber tract and excluded the neuron from the analysis if it was not Neurite orientation was defined as the angle of the line traced over the neurite The final measure of orientation for each neurite the deviation from an orientation parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tract is the acute angle between the neurite and the longitudinal axis of the tract without regard to the polarity of either This value ranged from 0 to 90 where 0 indicates a neurite growing in parallel with the longitudinal axis of the underlying tract and 90 indicates a neurite oriented perpendicular to the tract Analysis of neurite length and orientation were made by an observer without knowledge of which experimental group was being assessed All statistical comparisons of neurite length were made using two tailed unpaired Student s t tests Statistical comparisons of neurite orientation were made using one tailed unpaired Student s t tests Myelin histochemistry Sections adjacent to those used as substrata for culture were stained using the Rip immunohistochemical technique for labelling oligodendrocytes and their myelinating processes 50 Sixteen micron thick sections were mounted on gelatin coated slides and were post fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes at room temperature The sections were then rinsed with 1 M phosphate buffered saline PBS 3 times 11 minutes each and blocked with 20 FBS 1 Bovine Serum Albumin Sigma 0 1 Triton X 100 Sigma in 1 M PBS The sections were rinsed again and incubated overnight at 4 C with the Rip primary antibody Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank Iowa City IA diluted 1 4 in 1 M PBS The following day the sections were rinsed again and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with FITC conjugated sheep anti mouse IgG Boehringer Mannheim diluted 1 100 The sections were again rinsed and cover slipped using 90 glycerol as a mounting solution and then visualized using a Nikon Microphot microscope with a fluorescein filter and a 4x 10x or 20x objective Photomicrographs were captured with a Nikon 35 mm camera Other adjacent sections were stained using the Luxol Fast Blue technique 51 Sixteen micron thick sections were mounted on gelatin coated slides and were post fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes at room temperature The sections were then dehydrated by immersion in 70 ethanol 3 immersions 6 minutes each and then transferred to 95 ethanol for 6 minutes The sections were then stained with Luxol Fast Blue in 95 ethanol for 13 minutes at room temperature rinsed twice with 100 ethanol and cleared overnight in a third 100 ethanol rinse Subsequently the sections were rinsed 3 times in xylene and coverslipped using Permount Fisher as a mounting solution
