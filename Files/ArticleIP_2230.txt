 We Don t Like Your Altitude We Don t Like Your Altitude One of our goals at Slate is to provide what we call intelligent synthesis of the news of the week Through features such as Frame Game see William Saletan s analysis of the dismissal of the Paula Jones lawsuit we hope to provide a deeper understanding than a conventional news summary would enable but without the time wasting encrustation of quotations and anecdotes that clogs the typical newspaper or magazine story We like to think that in our small way we re having some influence on the conventional media too For example a few days ago the New York Times ran this headline Plane s Altitude Blamed in Crash That Killed 33 There in remarkably few words the Times gets to the essence of a complicated story Altitude problems caused the crash What more after all does one need to know Pedants may quibble that the problem was more precisely a lack of altitude but that is a small point The larger conceptual breakthrough is the Times discovery of the single factor altitude or the lack thereof that can explain all plane crashes past and future Solve the altitude problem and no one need fear boarding an airplane ever again We who write headlines as part of our jobs are used to being underappreciated for the contribution we make to human betterment We are ordinarily happy to labor in anonymity No one ever gets a byline for a headline however brilliant But this is a special case Some toiler on the Times copy desk has completed the great work begun by the Wright Brothers They lifted humankind up he or she has figured out how to keep us there It all depends on having the right altitude Surely a Pulitzer is called for if not a Nobel More for Your 19 95 We ll be trying a few new editorial features next week Watch out for them As announced last week International Papers is now attached to the Tuesday and Friday e mail deliveries of Today s Papers And starting in a couple of days your Monday morning delivery of Today s Papers will include our fruitcake of the Sunday Washington talk shows Pundit Central To sign up or to sign up again if you were cut off during the sign up process click here We invited Gertrude Himmelfarb the historian to exchange e mail for a week with journalist Andrew Sullivan about whatever struck them as interesting in the news that day Himmelfarb who is married to Irving Kristol the neoconservative thinker tortured us by saying it sounded like a good conversation over the breakfast table which is just what we have in mind but that she d rather keep her own views to her own breakfast table Damn But that did give us a name for this experimental dialogue The Breakfast Table and we did line up Nation columnist Katha Pollitt who is no mean consolation prize to share cyberkrispies with Sullivan starting Wednesday April 8 And we hope neither the vigorously conservative Himmelfarb nor the vigorously left wing Pollitt is offended at the notion that they are what used to be called moral equivalents Chatterbox our frequently updated column of gossip speculation scuttlebutt and philosophical reflection on politics has been so popular that we re initiating Culturebox a similar feature on well culture We define culture broadly to include almost anything except Monica Lewinsky who is adequately covered we hope by Chatterbox Michael Kinsley
