 Background The scientific community has recently witnessed the publication of several large eukaryotic genomes in various stages of completion including the human genome 1 2 the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans 3 the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster 4 and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana 5 6 Each of these genomes contains over 10 000 genes and as scientists attempt to study these genes more closely the need for accurate gene models becomes increasingly apparent For high throughput genome sequencing projects equally rapid high throughput genome annotation is necessary and bioinformaticists use a variety of computational methods to generate this annotation Despite many improvements in recent years these computational methods still fall short of producing correct models for every gene In order to improve the annotation and facilitate further research it is essential that we develop methods to identify genes correctly Annotation of a gene model should include a precise description of where the genomic DNA sequence is transcribed into messenger RNA the positions in the mRNA of any and all introns and the translated protein sequence of the gene If alternative splice variants are present these should be annotated as well Computational methods for genome annotation have several shortcomings that result in the following errors in annotation Gene prediction programs predict exon boundaries correctly only about 80 of the time even for the most intensively studied organisms 7 8 9 Thus a gene with five exons will be completely correct only 0 8 5 33 of the time and genes with more exons will be even less likely to be correct Gene prediction programs also tend to merge and split gene models Thus two real genes may be merged into one predicted transcript or vice versa In addition programs to align genomic DNA to protein sequences often miss small exons especially when the homologous proteins are not well conserved Annotation protocols also tend to miss short genes For example recent work has shown that at least one large family of Arabidopsis genes encodes a short 80 120 amino acid protein similar to a secreted polypeptide ligand for a receptor like kinase that functions in meristems 10 Most of these were missed in the original automated annotation of the Arabidopsis genome Alignment programs also make mistakes when genes occur in tandemly repeated copies Finally alignment of protein sequence to genomic DNA cannot predict untranslated regions UTRs and the leading ab initio gene prediction programs Genscan 11 GlimmerM 12 Genemark HMM 13 have great difficulty predicting UTRs most of them predict only the coding portion of a transcript The solution to many of these problems is to identify the complete sequence of the transcribed portions of the genome Sequencing the mature transcripts spliced mRNA solves three major problems first it permits accurate identification of the 5 and 3 UTRs Second in conjunction with complete genomic sequence it enables alignment software to identify the precise locations of all introns Third it aids in the discovery of new genes Results and discussion Re annotation of the Arabidopsisgenome The alignments generated from the cDNA sequences were used to create new gene models for the corresponding genes in the A thaliana genome Many of the genes have been manually curated but many others were created by automated scripts 5 6 Manual curation is still ongoing We used the cDNA alignments to create new gene models automatically according to the following criteria As described above there were 4 918 cDNAs for which all alignment programs agreed on the positions of all introns Using a majority voting scheme for the remaining 98 cDNAs did not always give a correct answer as discussed above therefore we used these only after manual inspection We assume the protein coding region is the longest ORF on the forward strand and required it to span at least 40 of the cDNA length This allowed us to create 4 809 gene models automatically leaving 109 cDNAs that were inspected manually to determine if they represent RNA genes pseudogenes or other types of sequence In one case cDNA Ceres 104289 the protein coding region was actually on the opposite strand corresponding to expressed protein At2g23670 and Ceres 20125 matched the correct strand supporting the gene annotation This could be explained in several ways as an example of antisense mediated translational control as two separate proteins on opposite strands perhaps expressed in different cell types or simply erroneous data In most of the other cases the problematic cDNA is either an RNA gene or a likely pseudogene Using the alignments from the 4 809 gene models we updated the annotation of the genome and evaluated how this had changed the previous annotation For the vast majority of genes 5 and 3 UTRs had not been annotated previously and these were added with the incorporaton of the cDNA data More interesting is how the protein coding regions changed Of the gene models 2 978 contained identical protein coding regions to what had already been annotated and required only UTR refinements but 1 591 were adjusted yielding more accurate protein sequences Some of these contain very short micro exons that are usually missed by ab initio gene prediction programs Perhaps most significant was the addition of 240 completely novel genes not previously included in the Arabidopsis genome annotation Of the 240 novel genes 92 have significant homology to known proteins and the rest do not match any previously described proteins In summary we found that 62 of the matching gene models further validated the existing exon intron structure for the gene 33 needed to be corrected and 5 represented previously undiscovered genes Micro exons We also used the cDNA alignments to detect micro exons very short exons that are typically missed by both gene finding programs and alignment algorithms Using new software protocols we developed we found 47 micro exons ranging from 3 to 25 base pairs bp in length distributed evenly across all five chromosomes To find micro exons we analyzed the results of sim4 alignments using all 5 016 Ceres cDNAs Sim4 identified 36 cDNAs encoding exons of 25 bp or less In an effort to identify additional micro exons sim4 alignments containing imperfect intron exon boundaries were examined We selected only those cases with near perfect alignments requiring that all but one or two exons have 100 identity We then checked to see if the 1 2 exons with slightly lower identity were misaligned as the result of the presence of a small undetected exon We used the 5 bp segments at the boundaries of the exon as probes If these 5 bp probes mismatched in the original alignment we searched the adjacent intron that is the intron identified by the initial alignment for short exons that would produce a perfect match with the cDNA We also required that any new exon would generate introns with a standard GT AG consensus on either end This procedure therefore yielded valid exon intron structures that always improved the identity of the alignment between cDNA and genomic DNA Figure 1shows an example of the cDNA alignments before and after inserting a micro exon Using this method we were able to identify 11 additional micro exons all shorter than 12 bp An extraordinarily short exon of only 3 bp was identified corresponding to exon 2 of disease resistance gene RAR1 At5g51700 A listing of these micro exons from all chromosomes is shown in Table 4 Note that in some cases the length of the micro exons is not a multiple of three for these one of the preceding or following exons had its boundary realigned to maintain the reading frame In comparison to the other alignment programs examined GeneSeqer proved to be highly competent in identifying micro exons 46 of the 47 micro exons were identified by GeneSeqer using the default settings After lowering the minimum exon length cut off to 1 bp all 47 were identified One indication that these micro exons are correct in addition to the identity with the cDNA is that many of them are homologous to exons in other Arabidopsis genes For example a search of GenBank in late 2001 revealed that the micro exon of Ceres 118038 is homologous to exons from five different cDNAs accession numbers gi 15028118 gi 6683111 gi 14517549 gi 15027838 and gi 16974574 The consensus sequence of these exons ATCCTAA T C G has been previously characterized as a micro exon in the potato invertase gene 21 Splicing anomalies Analysis of cDNA sequences can help to estimate the frequency of alternative splicing in a species Alternative splicing appears to be relatively common in animals 22 23 in plants this phenomenon has been less frequently observed possibly as a result of the smaller collections of ESTs compared with mammalian systems Recently some reports have appeared documenting a small number of cases 24 25 We examined the alignments of cDNAs to the genome looking for examples where more than one cDNA aligned to overlapping locations on the same chromosome in such a way as to predict a different splicing pattern The working hypothesis was that if two cDNAs mapped to the same locus but presented distinct sets of exons this would constitute evidence of alternative splicing or possibly another type of splicing anomaly We broadened the search for splicing anomalies by including in this protocol all the complete cDNAs available from GenBank including the Institute for Physical and Chemical Research RIKEN collection described below A total of 1 515 Ceres transcripts overlapped another transcript of which 1 129 overlapped a sequence from the RIKEN set This protocol identified 158 genes with apparent splicing anomalies each of which was inspected manually They fall into many different classes representing different genetic events as follows 27 alignments indicate an alternative 3 acceptor site for an intron 17 alignments indicate an alternative 5 donor site for an intron 23 alignments indicate that one or more introns remained unspliced In some cases more than one intron was unspliced for example in one interesting case only one intron was spliced in the RIKEN transcript gi 15146259 whereas four introns were spliced from the corresponding Ceres transcript Ceres 3992 corresponding to gene At2g35520 These unspliced transcripts may arise from nuclear rather than mature cytoplasmic mRNA sequences Six alignments indicate that an internal exon is missing in one isoform presumably the adjacent introns are spliced as a single intron containing the exon sequence Fifty seven alignments suggest possible alternative transcription initiation sites For 17 of these transcripts the putative initiation site was shifted far enough in the 3 direction to move past the first donor site making it impossible to splice out the first intron producing an additional 5 exon in one of the transcripts Many of the other transcripts contained one or more additional 5 exons as a result of alternative initiation sites Thirteen alignments suggest alternative 3 polyadenylation poly A sites that affect splicing The prediction of poly A sites can be confounded by misannealing of the oligo dT primers used for reverse transcription for example the presence of multiple adenines within the 3 UTR can be mistaken for a poly A site Misannealing cannot explain the presence of unspliced intronic sequence found at the terminus of 12 of these 13 transcripts suggesting that these putative poly A sites are genuine and have an impact on splicing We have found similar evidence for the occurrence of multiple poly A sites in RACE PCR experiments directed at cloning cDNAs from hypothetical genes Finally 15 alignments display multiple splicing anomalies falling into more than one of the categories above Table 5lists many of these alternatively spliced genes the complete list with graphical and textual alignment data is available on line 26 and is also provided as Additional data with this paper online Figure 2highlights several interesting examples In Figure 2a the alternative 3 splice site on the second intron leads to a shift in the reading frame producing a different protein sequence In Figure 2b alignments of several cDNAs indicate that the last intron is unspliced Figure 2cshows that different 5 ends lead to differing 5 introns and exons while not changing the protein sequence in this particular example Figure 2dshows a centrally located exon that is spliced out along with the surrounding introns Figure 2econtains three different 5 transcription start sites three different 3 termination sites and two unspliced introns in the middle transcript The unspliced introns occur within exon 2 of GI 14335057 which corresponds to three exons and two introns in both the other transcripts Note that some of the alternative splicing events occur within the same ecotype Neither collection of cDNAs can be considered a random sample of transcripts and therefore the number of examples of alternative splicing discovered in this data approximately 10 of the overlapping transcripts should not be used to extrapolate to the entire genome The discovery of transcripts with different introns spliced out raises the question of whether the different spliced products are translated and whether the splicing differences reflect programmed developmental variation or simply splicing errors It is not possible to answer these questions now but incomplete splicing and consequential variants in plants have been noted previously to be associated with gene silencing and were postulated to reflect the regulated production of aberrant RNA products not destined to be translated 27 One clear conclusion is that alternative splicing can be discovered via analysis of cDNAs and genomic sequence and that a fuller collection of cDNAs will provide a valuable resource for more discoveries about splicing and gene regulation Are the sequences full length An independent project to sequence complete Arabidopsis cDNAs is ongoing by the SPP consortium 28 using clones created by K Shinozaki at RIKEN in Japan These sequences are publicly available from GenBank search for RIKEN cDNA Arabidopsis These data provided the opportunity to compare the two sets of cDNAs and measure independently how many of them appear to cover the entire length of the predicted mRNA transcript The sequencing of the RIKEN cDNAs generated 2 996 sequences as of October 2001 we compared these to the 5 016 cDNAs from Ceres and found 1 129 sequences that are contained in both data sets Of the 1 129 sequences 941 alignments yield the same exon intron structure for the underlying gene We then asked for each of the sequences containing identical introns do the 5 and 3 ends match and if not how large is the difference The results are illustrated in Figure 3 Several observations can be made about these results First it is important to note that the Ceres clones were selected for full length sequencing from among a large number of clustered 5 sequences see Materials and methods whereas the RIKEN clones were sequenced on the 3 end followed by clustering and selection of a clone for sequencing 29 The methods for creating the full length cDNA sequences at both centers involve multiple sequencing runs followed by assembly of the overlapping sequences Second we observed that in the Ceres data many mRNAs appeared to have two or more putative alternative transcription start sites This became apparent when different cDNA assemblies were found to overlap exactly except for an extension on the 5 end on one or more clones It is interesting to note that when the RIKEN clones were longer or shorter on the 5 end clones of the equivalent length could often be found in the Ceres collection Multiple clones with the same 5 end provided strong validation that these were truly representative of alternative transcription initiation sites or repeatable artifacts of the cloning process Overall there were 397 Ceres clones that were 10 bp longer on the 5 end and 136 RIKEN clones that were longer on the 5 end If alternative transcription initiation is the correct explanation then it is relatively common It is worth noting that in almost all cases both alternative cDNAs contain complete ORFs On the 3 end the Ceres and RIKEN databases each contained 316 sequences that were 10 bp longer than their match from the other set If these represent alternative polyadenylation sites or stabilized ends of RNA that get polyadenylated then these are quite common Further investigation will be necessary to determine if the 3 end of transcripts truly varies at such a high frequency In summary work described in this study on Arabidopsis illustrates the utility of full length cDNAs for finding alternative splice variants short exons UTRs short genes and alternative transcription start sites The annotation of eukaryotic genomes is currently an inexact and developing science and the results described here demonstrate the power of full length cDNA sequences for improving the quality of multiple aspects of genome annotation Materials and methods Preparation and sequencing of cDNA Starting material for cDNA synthesis was polysomal RNA isolated from the top most inflorescence tissues ecotype Wassilewskija and from roots ecotype Landsberg erecta RNA from roots of Landsberg erecta was used to construct the libaries because of the availability of high quality RNA Nine parts inflorescence to one part root as measured by wet mass was used to make three size fractionated libraries Because the ecotypes were mixed before library construction we cannot determine the source ecotype for any individual cDNA Polysomal RNA was isolated from a detergent generated supernatant on a 2 M sucrose cushion To capture full length cDNAs an oligonucleotide is first attached to intact 5 ends taking advantage of the cap After first and second strand synthesis the full length cDNAs were selected size fractionated and cloned into pBluescript The ligation mixture was transformed into bacteria selected on appropriate antibiotics and picked into 384 well microtiter plates In repeated rounds of sequencing several tens of thousands of clones from the three libraries were sequenced from the 5 end the sequences clustered and the clone with the longest 5 end in each cluster selected for complete sequencing The number of clones sequenced in each round depended on the percentage of new full length clones that could be obtained from each of the size fractionated libraries As the clones reported in this study came from non normalized libraries only three rounds of 5 sequencing were employed 42 000 in the first round 59 000 in the second round and 22 000 in the final round Following each round of 5 sequencing all sequences were clustered using a clustering algorithm that forms separate clusters if there are more than 6 nucleotide differences in any 30 nucleotide window of the match In this way clones would not fall into separate clusters simply because of ecotypic differences different putative transcription start sites or sequencing errors However they would cluster separately if alternative splicing occurred in the first approximately 500 nucleotides and involved more than 6 nucleotides Following clustering the clone that was longest on the 5 end was selected for full length sequencing If clones were of comparable length on the 5 end the clone to be sequenced was selected from the library with the highest percentage of full length clones Sequencing of 5 ends was performed on capillary sequencers Molecular Dynamics full length sequencing was done on ABI377 sequencers using primer walking The 5 016 clones analyzed in this study were selected from all full length clones based on length 400 nucleotides non redundancy eliminating alternatively spliced clones and length of the putative ORF relative to overall clone length Alignment of cDNA sequences to the A thalianagenome Four programs were used to align all 5 016 Ceres cDNA sequences to the A thaliana genome as follows First each program was used to align each cDNA sequence to the genome Some programs cannot efficiently handle a search comparing a cDNA to a 30 Mb eukaryotic chromosome and to compensate for those programs we created a modified procedure that first used BLASTN to identify and extract a region of 20 000 bp surrounding the gene Each cDNA was aligned to the corresponding 20 kb genome sequence segment using all four programs with default parameter settings The resulting alignments were then compared automatically to generate the comparison data appearing in the main text The programs are sim4 available from 30 dds gap2 available from 31 GeneSeqer available from 32 and est_genome available from 33 Gene models were constructed by first recreating the cDNA sequence using the Arabidopsis genome sequence employing the longest alignment for which all programs predicted identical splice sites The longest ORF was identified along the forward strand of the cDNA followed by a division of the ORF into protein coding exon segments and untranslated regions of exons These constructed gene models were then compared to the existing gene annotation at the mapped genomic region Previously annotated gene structures that disagreed with the cDNAs were replaced by the cDNA alignment based gene models and new gene models were created where pre existing gene annotations were lacking Additional data files Additional data corresponding to anomalous splicing including png image files and text formatted multiple alignments is available
