like a little playhouse or something It had two porches on it And um we had rabbits Pet rabbits and I had a pet chicken And I taught a pet and asked her where her eggs were And she would take me to them My dad sold them to the grocer and I wouldn t ever eat another chicken that came from the grocery store I was afraid I d be eating my pet I don t That s right I was afraid I would be eating my pet And so I never ate any more chicken from that grocery store I remember down in the woods I had this like a Partner Stepping on them flowers And climb them trees The taller the better Guess I was a tomboy Tammy was too It s a small thing but Daddy was an alcoholic And sometime good times and sometimes not so good times It s pretty good up and until he was a truck driver And went along on them long hauls sometimes Went up to New York and everything And get snow bound Got gas in the truck Driving a truck to him was like a habit or something you know He d hear the sound of a truck and tell you what it was That s a white That s a diesel and then he couldn t drive it anymore He became a plumber s helper you know and it killed him He had about a fifth grade education Long pause How s that I remember we were coming up to Charlotte to visit They still had um the way they delivered milk was in a with a horse The thing they pulled I can remember waking up to the sound of the horse Clip clop clip clop And I don t know it sort of made you feel secure And that s the way they brought around ice too They didn t have any refrigerators then Maybe some people did but most people didn t And believe it or not that was in the 40 s 50 s That s during World War II You probably don t remember that do you Um huh No I know I was living then but don t know I remember some little things They were playing war games near our house in Wadesboro and they got them guys got Mama to bake them a cake Is that twenty minutes of recording Well I just told you that Daddy was an alcoholic So when I was a teenager I was so embarrassed you know my friends would come by It s a small town So everybody knows that he s one of the town drunks I mean there were quite a few of them And I told Mama that it was darn right embarrassing he d get drunk you know like in the summer time and then he d get as far the yard and pass out I told Mama it was embarrassing for my friends to come by there ride by there there he was laying in the yard passed out So the next time he started to lay down in the yard Mama told him she said Clayton if I were you would not lay down in the yard and go to sleep He mumbled something or other and laid down in the yard and went to sleep She took him by his feet and we had steps to go up on the porch And pulled him up his head going Bump bump bump all the way up them steps It s bad when you don t even feel it Oh he was saying oh oh oh He felt it He was just to drunk to do anything about it Wasn t he Drinking I don t understand They say they drink to forget their troubles and then that s all they talk about Me when I m drinking I get sick on the stomach My mother said that God has blessed me and made me that way because I could have been like Daddy and could have been an alcoholic I can t understand how anyone likes the taste of it Where s the boys At home When did you uh get married Huh When did you get married Well I came to Charlotte to live with my grandmother I was engaged to a boy in Wadesboro But I came up here and So you were running from him No I came up here to work Did you mean to leave him He left me first He was in prison He went to prison Oh And I m still writing to him up here but I met George Watkins and I really don t know how to pick men He um believe it or not I met him in the church but he turned out to be a paranoid schizophrenic And his doctor said he was dangerous and it was best that I got away from him But you didn t listen to his doctor did you Yes No you waited until he ran you out the door I was out the door that time I just had on black shorts and red shirt and I was a witch Living with him you had to be careful of what you wore What colors How you picked up anything on the dresser and put it down or you were arranging some witchcraft stuff The reason the doctor say I shouldn t live there is that Um he thought the bible said well it does say don t suffer a witch to live so he might kill me I was teaching ya ll my kids witchcraft too he said Well like I told you Tammy I could tell bits and parts of my life story and make I don t know how many books If I could just get into it sit down and think about it and do it Sitting down and writing it should remind you of some of the battles I would read the True Story magazine sometimes and think Good gosh she didn t have it any rougher then I did And why did she go out and become a heron addict or Was your whole life bad or did you have anything good happen I had fun I danced Um I sang And my best friend was Eleanor Ruth Hare And we went
