 Asian or American Asian Americans who so rarely appear in print or on television can tell you that the media are no mirror of the nation s complexion But they understand that the media do reflect the nation s psyche and that is why the events of recent weeks have been so distressing First U S intelligence analyst Robert Kim was accused of spying for South Korea Then the John Huang Lippo scandal broke raising suspicions about Asian money in American politics Suddenly there was no shortage of Asian names in the news Just as suddenly a question was in the air Do Asian Americans have dual loyalties No one to my knowledge has framed the issue quite so explicitly William Safire for instance has hyped the so called Asian connection with dark mutterings about favor hungry foreigners insidious networking and penetration by Asian interests The pull quote in his Oct 10 column Selling influence to rich aliens veers into The Protocols of the Elders of Zion territory But even Safire felt compelled recently to throw in a some of my best friends paragraph of praise for hard working Asian Americans The old Nixon hand knows well that innuendo is effective only if well calibrated Still the unmistakable subtext of Safire s columns and the press coverage of the Lippo affair is that Asians in America are just that Asians in America sojourners and foreigners Thus when we learned that Huang had raised over 5 million for the Democrats little distinction was made reportorially or morally between contributions from abroad and contributions from Americans of Asian descent Moreover Huang s activities however unlawful have now given rise to a presumption that Asian American political participation is merely a cover for some sinister foreign agenda Of course the notion that Asian Americans are torn between an outward allegiance to this country and a hard wired fealty to some Oriental motherland has a long and undistinguished pedigree The indelible Chineseness of Chinese immigrants was the rationale for the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 The indelible Japaneseness of Japanese American citizens justified their internment after Pearl Harbor Small wonder that Asian Americans have protested the tenor of the Lippo reportage and the portrayal of Asian Americans as people with divided loyalties But the source of these stereotypes is not solely white racism or even the more subtle prejudices of Safire and his ilk It is also to a lesser but still substantial degree the racialist language of modern day identity politics One ever feels this twoness an American a Negro two souls two thoughts two unreconciled strivings two warring ideas in one dark body whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder So wrote W E B Du Bois in 1903 describing in The Souls of Black Folk a double consciousness that afflicted yet graced the coloreds of his day Nearly a century later the metaphor of dual identity endures in our racial narratives The notion that minorities are instrinsically alienated from themselves and that the struggle is somehow ennobling is a central tenet of multiculturalist ideology We see it in ethnic studies courses and academic talk of racial destiny We see it in the deconstructions of O J Simpson s blackness We see it in the ghosts and doppelg ngers who populate the melodramas of Amy Tan and her imitators This bifurcation is intuitively appealing because it makes concrete the ambivalence of assimilation the gnawing sense among many people of color that membership in the mainstream comes at a high personal cost The symbolism of split personalities and divided souls also has visceral power And there is a certain romance to the imagery adorning the ordinary lives of nonwhite folk with the dignity of redemptive suffering But there is too much that is flawed about this pose For what do we presume when we speak of the minority person s dual identity We presume that racial identity is foreordained and monolithic and ever at odds with national identity We presume also as Stanley Crouch has dryly observed that identity is never more complex than double Black nationalists like their counterparts in Asian America or Latino Nation believe that race is primordial as organic as gender But consider the Asian American Thirty years ago there was no such creature There were only Americans of Chinese descent or Japanese or Indian But over the course of a generation activists and bureaucrats have manufactured a single race out of a diverse mass of several million people whose origins can be traced to dozens of countries What has bound this Asian American race together is not its biological badge eyelid folds hair color pigmentation but its cultural content Through magazines and campus clubs and advocacy organizations self appointed race leaders have sought to create an authentic Asian American consciousness by inventing something called Asian American culture The fact that they are succeeding tells us something about the magnetic appeal of racial fundamentalism More importantly it reminds us that racial identity is utterly malleable and that racial essence is utterly artificial Yet even if we did believe in the fixity of races double identity is meaningless unless we also presume that American identity is immutably white As the critic Albert Murray has long argued that wasn t even true in Du Bois time It is even less true now and not because America in the classic pluralist formulation is a nation of nations a neutral holding pen for various diasporas nor because America is some dehumanizing single mold melting pot What gives lie to anyone s whitewashed vision of national identity and what makes America exceptional is the fact that American culture is more hybridized and mongrelized than anything humanity has ever before seen When California Caucasians are practicing Feng Shui and Zen meditation when suburban Asian teens are reciting gangsta rap lyrics when salsa sales are surging past ketchup sales how can we speak with a straight face about the ineffaceable whiteness of American life And how then can we sustain the race nation opposition central to double consciousness Ultimately the weakness of the dual identity myth is that it reduces humans into bits of binary code It treats the American experience as a simple equation plotted along two axes as if class or gender or birthplace or birth order or family structure mattered not as if contingency never sculpted one s sense of self And in the name of anti racialism it recommits the worst errors of racialism Denying the minority individual his full complex humanity interpreting his voice as the mere expression of a greater Volksgeist In the milieu of contemporary multiculturalism that sort of illogic can be affirming So long as color is a proxy for entitlement there will be many who find it useful to ostentatiously posit a conflict between their racial core and their assimilated shell But the fallout from the John Huang debacle should remind Asian Americans that claims of racial loyalty can cut both ways And it should remind us all that flimsy notions of the minority s eternally dual identity whether tinged with xenophobia or candied with race pride in the end amount to just so much double talk
