between a White House intern Monica Lewinsky then 21 and the president of the United States a man old enough to be her father in or near the Oval Office between November 1995 and December 1997 This case is not about sex but about possible criminal conduct by President Bill Clinton in violation of his oath of office and the laws of this nation including perjury subornation of perjury and obstruction of justice A review of the relevant criminal violations is in order for a proper judgment to be rendered by your committee I PERJURY The details of the illicit sexual contacts between

caressed her and she moved with new intense passion as she saw him arouse himself his face distorted in a mask of sheer lust Oh my God Monica you turn me on more than any woman I ve ever known he exclaimed in between rapid pants of excitement I want to marry you after I leave the White House and leave Hillary far far behind With that Monica exultantly threw the dress down at his feet as the president groaned in ecstasy and release leaving traces of his love on her dress a memento of the passion they shared together Tripp tapes Pages 124 192 Tripp testimony Pages 36 43 Lewinsky I Page 67 Monica never imagined that the dress she treasured would someday be used to help convince publishers that her exclusive story of their steamy love affair complete with shocking new details was well worth 10 million or more foreign rights included In his Jan 17 1998 deposition the president said he couldn t recall the specifics of most gifts Lewinsky gave him and yet he strongly denied receiving a silver cigar box from Lewinsky Clinton deposition Page 54 But a reported sexual encounter between Ms Lewinsky and Mr Clinton challenges the president s veracity under oath on this matter Our office has received compelling evidence that Lewinsky not only gave the president the box but Ms Lewinsky conspired with the president to use at least one 1 cigar from the box to perform a lewd and lascivious act in violation of a Washington D C criminal statute Lewinsky testimony I Pages 121 184 Exhibit C Nieman Marcus receipt Oct 1 1996 The Drudge Report Aug 22 1998 D C statute 531 6b Item On

their romance to the world In response the president handed her a velvet box with a silver ring inside Our love is important to me he told her Her heart filled with an overpowering love for him but she was puzzled when he leered It matches the silver of the cigar box He reached into the silver humidor and took out a clear wrapped El Tempo and gave her a big grin You can t commit adultery with a cigar right Lewinsky I Pages 155 170 She wondered again whether he cared for her as a person or just as a sex object to service his sickest desires She was shocked to realize that it didn t matter really as long as she got to be with him now and forever Lewinsky diary Pages 92 93 Hand me that cigar big boy she said hoisting up her skirt wallowing in all the depravity he taught her and let s see

Lewinsky I Pages 175 179 They were both plunged into a crazed maelstrom of feverish ecstasy and afterward he asked her a special favor Darlin if you re ever called to testify about our relationship
