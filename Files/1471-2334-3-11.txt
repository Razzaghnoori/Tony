 Background Community acquired pneumonia CAP is the 6th leading cause of death in the USA and the leading cause of death from an infectious disease 1 2 Approximately 4 million adults are diagnosed annually and mortality averages 14 in hospitalized cases 3 From the standpoint of cost and quality of care a key decision in management is whether to treat patients as outpatients or as inpatients There is general agreement that a substantial number of inpatients admitted on the basis of conventional criteria might be safely managed as outpatients An estimated 4 billion is expended annually on CAP patients with inpatient therapy costing as much as 20 times outpatient antimicrobial therapy 4 Risks and probable outcomes in patients with community acquired pneumonia have always been assessed intuitively by clinicians but are now being intensively and formally studied Several risk scoring systems have been developed to assign patients to different risk categories with respect to important outcomes such as mortality or intensive care unit admission 5 The need for determining hospitalization criteria led to the development of the Pneumonia Severity Index PSI by the Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team 6 The PSI index stratifies patients into five classes with those in class I and II PSI 70 representing low risk individuals that can be safely managed at home This study uniquely integrates analyses of demographic social and financial factors in addition to clinical factors in an attempt to evaluate their significance in decisions involving hospital admissions of low risk CAP patients This would provide a better understanding to the interaction of physician patient and health system factors in admitting low risk CAP patients In addition comparing the average cost of hospitalization of low risk patients with the average cost of outpatient CAP antimicrobial therapy provides a picture of potential financial savings to the health care system Methods Statistical analysis The principal study objective was determination of statistically significant differences in variables assessed between PSI class II ED discharged patients and those admitted SAS v8 2 was used in all statistical analyses The raw data was read into SAS from EXCEL data sheet Based on the categorical nature of the data collected chi square tests using PROC FREQ option were used to determine statistically significant associations between each demographic clinical and laboratory radiologic parameter and disposition ED discharge versus hospitalization PROC MEANS option was used to determine the mean age in years and mean cost of care for each group of patients Associations were considered statistically significant where p 0 05 two tailed hypothesis Results A total of 296 patients were evaluated in the emergency department with a diagnosis of simple community acquired pneumonia ICD 9 486 during the study period refer table 1 The age range for all patients was 18 49 years mean 35 6 years Two hundred and eight patients 70 were discharged from the emergency room while 88 30 were admitted for inpatient management A breakdown of the ED discharged group by class revealed 169 81 were PSI class II 36 17 were class III and 3 1 were class IV In the admitted groups 67 76 were class II 11 13 were class III and 10 11 class IV Table 1 Classes V and I had no representation in either the ED discharged or admitted groups The demographic clinical laboratory and radiological comparison between PSI class II ED discharged and class II admitted is shown in table 2 Patients ages were similar in the two groups mean ages 39 5 3 years and 37 8 7 years for ED discharged and hospitalized patients respectively In the ED class II discharged group 66 39 were males and 103 61 females compared to

rate p 0001 Majority of patients in both ED discharged and admitted groups were covered by private insurance p 0034 The average length of stay for PSI class II patients seen and hospitalized was 3 5 days at an average cost of 3909 347 3 The estimated mean cost of outpatient management was 476 02 99 25 All patients in the admitted group were discharged directly home There was no short or long term care placement and there were complications noted One hundred and eighteen 70 of the 169 of the ED discharged groups were successfully reached via telephone for interview Three 2 5 of the one hundred eighteen patients interviewed in the ED discharge group had a second ED visit within thirty days with fever cough and sore throat which may be attributed to failed outpatient therapy Interestingly these patients visited different emergency departments Five patients 4 visited the primary care doctors within one week for failure to tolerate the initial antibiotics prescribed and persistent malaise None required re hospitalization Seven patients 6 felt they should have been hospitalized for better care and more intense investigations Discussion Management of community acquired pneumonia has been progressively complicated by several factors expanding spectrum of causative organisms rising prevalence of antibiotic resistance increasing population of patients with advancing age and with comorbidities and the interest in reducing the number of unnecessary admissions The initial site of care decision is perhaps the single most important clinical decision made by physicians during the entire course of illness for patients with CAP It has a direct bearing on the intensity of laboratory testing microbiologic evaluation antibiotic therapy and costs of treating this illness The estimated average cost of inpatient care for CAP is 7500 compared with 150 350 for outpatient care 2 The pneumonia severity index shows a direct correlation between risk class and risk of death and has been validated as a guide for decisions regarding hospitalization Age is a major component of the PSI The age of the patient is added to other parameters used in the index Patients above the age of fifty were excluded in the study These patients are more likely to have chronic comorbid conditions which places them in higher risk CAP group in contrast to the target CAP population of our study Several factors that the rule does not take into account may greatly influence the decision to admit a patient the most important being factors related to the patient such as poor social support inability to maintain oral intake and history of substance abuse The admission decision may also be influenced by the availability of outpatient support services home nursing home intravenous therapy and alternative sites for care subacute care services Demographic and social parameters are clearly important considerations in the quality of care delivered to all patients In this study statistically significant differences for gender were seen between the class II patients seen in the ED and subsequently discharged and those hospitalized The odds of a PSI class II male CAP patient being seen and managed on outpatient basis was 2 9 times the odds of a female patient in the same risk class being managed as an outpatient 95 CI 1 4632 5 8950 Table 2 In a study looking at sex differentials in health Verbrugge found that females generally show a higher incidence of acute conditions more short term restricted activity more use of health services and medicines and were more willing than men to seek medical care for perceived symptoms 7 Women have also been shown to have greater willingness to acknowledge and report illness 8 Our findings agree with the view that women are more predisposed than men to rate their health poor and therefore more likely to accept hospitalization compared to males especially if there is agreement between the ED physician and their primary care doctor on admissions 9 Statistically significant higher hospitalization was found among PSI class II African Americans compared to whites OR 0 5738 95 CI 0 3214 0 7326 This finding is interesting in view of the disparities believed to exist between blacks and whites in both need and access to health care services Previous studies have shown that blacks are less likely to receive medical services particularly intensive care than whites 10 11 So what could be responsible for the statistically significant higher proportion of blacks in the PSI class II hospitalized group A national phone survey found that blacks were more likely than whites to report that their physician did not inquire sufficiently about their illness did not tell them how long it would take for prescribed medicine to work did not explain the seriousness of their illness or injury and did not discuss test or examination findings 12 In addition blacks were less likely than whites to be satisfied with the care provided during their most recent hospitalization or ambulatory care visits 13 One hypothesis may therefore be that physicians subconsciously prefer to err on the side of caution when managing African American low risk CAP patients in view of their lower socioeconomic status weaker social support systems and their prevailing higher level of dissatisfaction seen with medical services Factors such as education and the skills that come from it inevitably restrict the ability of some black patients to gain access to and negotiate effectively for the best medical treatment available which in this case may not be hospitalization for a PSI class II patient 14 In addition Schoenbaum et al have shown that blacks are less likely to demand or receive adequate information about their disease process and more likely to report themselves to be in poor health than whites of the same age group and gender 15 It has also been speculated that blacks and whites may differ in terms of their treatment preferences but such a difference has not been documented and may merely be a result of the interaction of complex sociocultural and economic factors 16 PSI class II patients with medical insurance coverage had a statistically significant higher hospitalization rate than uninsured patients of the same PSI class OR 0 4685 95 CI 0 1923 0 6981 Numerous studies have shown that uninsured persons have greater difficulty accessing inpatient care fewer procedures and shorter hospitalizations and are more likely to receive substandard care for medical injury 17 18 A study by Jackson that looked at the impact of health insurance status on emergency room services revealed uninsured emergency patients were less likely to be admitted to the hospital than insured emergency patients 19 Weissman et al in their study compared hospitalized patients and found that after adjusting for diagnosis related group case mix uninsured patients had on average 7 shorter stays 5 36 vs 5 79 days and underwent 7 fewer procedures 1 16 vs 1 25 than insured patients the differences varying with hospital type 20 Halm et al theorized greater involvement by primary care physicians who are more likely to admit low risk patients could be responsible for the similar differences seen in their study since uninsured patients are often admitted to the service of house staff and frequently have their need for hospitalization reassessed by a senior physician 21 The decision to hospitalize is not necessarily a commitment to long term inpatient care but rather a decision that certain patients should be closely observed until it is clear that therapy can be safely continued out of the hospital Even in institutions with established clinical guidelines for CAP admissions adherence is highly variable and associated with a variety of patient system and physician factors Since criteria for admissions have not been uniformly applied by clinicians studies have reported wide geographic variation in hospital admission rates for CAP 22 In the same study by Halm et al 71 of 163 low risk CAP patients were hospitalized despite recommendation for outpatient therapy 21 Physicians reasons for admission were the presence of active comorbidities 55 primary care physician s wish for hospitalization 41 the presence of worse pneumonia than the guideline indicated 36 patient preference 17 and inadequate home support 16 In some studies physicians have overestimated the risk of death for patients with CAP leading to unnecessary admissions while in other studies they have failed to recognize patients as being severely ill at the time of initial evaluation 6 23 The result of our study concurs with others in suggesting factors other than clinical demographic socioeconomic frequently influence physicians decisions for hospitalizing low risk CAP patients 21 22 High fever and tachycardia were the only clinical parameters with statistically significant differences between the two groups p 0 0001 No significant differences were identified for other clinical parameters included in the PSI altered mental status hypotension and tachypnea p 0 05 There were also no significant differences noted for laboratory and radiological parameters arterial pH BUN Na glucose hematocrit and pulse oximetery ABG pleural effusion p 0 05 Pressure from overcrowding in the ED or bolus admissions multiple potential admissions at the same time may influence physician decisions for hospitalizing low risk CAP patients but this factor is not easy to determine retrospectively Resident physicians in teaching hospitals like St Agnes Hospital frequently raise objections to hospitalizing low risk CAP patients especially early in their training They however soon realize it is almost easier to write admission orders and send patients to appropriate medical floors rather than spending hours arguing with attending physicians in the ED only to finally admit the same patients It is interesting that neither time of initial ED assessment 7am 7pm versus 7pm 7am or day of ED evaluation weekdays versus weekends were associated with differences in hospitalization rates of low risk CAP patients No other studies have found time to be a statistically significant variable in predicting hospitalization of low risk CAP patients Table 2 Although Fine and colleagues state that low risk patients should be considered as candidates for outpatient therapy there is evidence that a substantial number of patients in the low risk group would still require hospitalization 6 A study by Roson and colleagues in Spain 24 found that 40 of admitted CAP patients were low risk out of which approximately half did not have irrefutable reasons for admission Certain studies have also suggested that the use of PSI as the principal variable in making the admissions decision could compromise patient care especially in the economically disadvantaged 25 This study is limited by its retrospective nature and relatively small sample size Our study also excluded patients greater than fifty years of age limiting its significance in older populations There was also poor documentation by physicians on valid reasons for hospitalizing low risk patients such as persistent nausea and vomiting dehydration homelessness and failed prior outpatient management A similar study found that many patients with a low predicted mortality risk were likely admitted for these reasons 26 There was no mortality recorded in the PSI class II hospitalized group All the patients in the admitted group were discharged directly home there were no short or long term care placements While the outcomes of all patients discharged from the ED could not be determined a substantial number of these patients were reached by telephone to ascertain their outcomes Potential recall bias due to the greater than one year between the index hospitalization and follow up interviews is possible The none blinded structure of the interviews is also likely to contribute information and investigator biases Even after considering the potential limitations of this study no irrefutable reasons for hospitalizations were identified Despite the fact that some patients might have been hospitalized due to mitigating circumstances like poor oral intake and weak support systems which were inadequately documented in the charts the average length of stay for hospitalized low risk CAP patients 3 5 days is hardly justifiable for low risk patients This is indicative of overutilization of resources through unjustifiable hospitalizations No hospitalized patient was transferred to a nursing home or required other forms of placement that might influence the length of hospital stay Alcohol and substance abuse related diagnoses were also not statistically different between the two groups p 0 05 All patients were treated with the current empirical standard of care for CAP i e combination of a third generation cephalosporin and a macrolide or flouroquinolone as monotherapy with necessary prescription adjustments after bacteriology results where applicable The average cost of inpatient care was 3909 00 compared to 476 00 for outpatient care The latter reflects the cost of ED assessment and cost of oral outpatient antibiotics These figures depict an eight fold higher cost of care in the hospitalized group compared to the outpatient group The cost of inpatient care in this study is much lower than the 7500 average cost reported by Niedermann et al and may be because of the differences between our study populations younger age group without major comorbidities 2 Conclusions This study demonstrates existing overhospitalization of low risk CAP patients in the community hospital studied Nearly three quarters of PSI class II community acquired pneumonia patients seen during the period covered were admitted without irrefutable reasons contrary to clinical management recommendations African American female and medically insured patients were more likely to be admitted with low risk CAP Tachycardia and high fever are strong clinical predictors for hospitalizing low risk CAP patients There is poor documentation by physicians of reasons for hospitalization of low risk CAP patients The association between demographic socioeconomic and clinical variables with physicians admissions decision of low risk CAP patients indicate the need to incorporate such variables in the clinical management guidelines of these patients The eight fold higher cost of care seen in hospitalized patients compared to outpatients of the same risk class is indicative of potential cost savings to the health care system with unifying admission criteria It would also limit the health care human resource crisis notably nurse to patient ratio and serve as a quality indicator The findings of this study adds to existing literature in assisting clinicians adjust their admissions criteria and supports the American Thoracic Society ATS and Infectious Disease Society of North America IDSA recommendations for use of the PSI in initial decision making for CAP patients However the role of the PSI might best be as a component in the algorithm along with social and economic considerations Such considerations must be clearly and adequately documented to justify such admissions
