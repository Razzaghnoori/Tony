 Background In S cerevisiae a key event accompanying exit from mitosis is the inactivation of Clb Cdc28 protein kinase achieved through degradation of Clb and accumulation of the Clb Cdc28 inhibitor Sic1 reviewed in 1 Anaphase Promoting Complex Cyclosome APC C ubiquitin ligase and its substrate specific activator Hct1 Cdh1 are required for degradation of Clb2 the major mitotic cyclin in the budding yeast reviewed in 2 Whereas hct1 and sic1 cells appear relatively normal hct1 sic1 cells are inviable presumably due to their inability to extinguish Cdc28 activity in telophase 3 The complexity in the regulation of mitotic exit is underscored by the existence of a set of genes essential for this process referred to as the mitotic exit network MEN They encode the GTP binding protein Tem1 and its putative guanine nucleotide releasing factor Lte1 the dual specificity protein phosphatase Cdc14 protein kinases Cdc5 Cdc15 and Dbf2 Dbf20 the Dbf2 binding protein Mob1 reviewed in 4 and the spindle pole body component Nud1 5 Conditional lethal temperature sensitive ts mutations in any of the MEN genes cause cells to arrest in late mitosis with elevated mitotic Cdk activity when shifted to the restrictive temperature Inactivation of Cdc28 by overexpression of Sic1 suppresses multiple MEN mutants and hyperactivation of Cdc28 by overexpression of Clb2 exacerbates their phenotypes consistent with the idea that a key function of the MEN proteins is to eradicate Cdc28 activity during the transition from anaphase telophase to G1 6 7 8 9 Recently important advances have been made in our understanding of how the MEN is switched on during anaphase Tem1 is thought to be kept inactive throughout early mitosis by the two component GTPase activating protein complex Bub2 Bfa1 which co localizes with Tem1 at the spindle pole body 10 11 When the mitotic spindle penetrates the mother daughter neck the Tem1 bound spindle pole body is translocated into the daughter cell where a cortical pool of Lte1 is thought to activate Tem1 12 13 In addition to this spatial regulation the GTPase activity of Bfa1 is thought to be inactivated through its phosphorylation by Cdc5 14 but it remains unknown how this process is coordinated with the presumed juxtaposition of Lte1 and Tem1 in the daughter cell Despite this rapid progress in understanding the signals that regulate the MEN the direct downstream targets of the MEN have yet to be apprehended To address how the MEN components downstream of Cdc15 are organized and what their targets are we sought tab telophase arrest bypassed mutants that alleviate the essential requirement for CDC15 In theory tab mutants could act downstream of or parallel to CDC15 and could be either loss of function mutations in genes that inhibit exit from mitosis or gain of function mutations in genes that promote exit from mitosis To our surprise mutations in six linkage groups were uncovered with three groups being recessive tab1 tab3 and three groups being dominant TAB5 7 We have shown in earlier studies that tab2 1 is a reduction of function mutation in NET1 a k a CFI1 15 16 17 and that TAB6 is a gain of function mutation in CDC14 18 Net1 sequesters Cdc14 in the nucleolus and inactivates it in preanaphase cells During exit from mitosis a TEM1 CDC15 dependent signal frees Cdc14 from the nucleolus and allows it to promote inactivation of Clb Cdc28 15 17 19 The fact that both Net1 and Cdc14 are directly involved in exit from mitosis validates the effectiveness of the tab screen and heightens the potential value of the uncharacterized tab mutants Here we present a detailed description of the tab mutant screen and describe a third TAB gene TAB1 MTR10 Results Cdc15 promotes activation of Clb proteolysis by a post translational mechanism Transcription has been postulated to play an important role in triggering exit from mitosis 20 For example Dbf2 a protein kinase that promotes exit from mitosis is associated with the CCR4 transcription regulatory complex 21 In addition the Swi5 transcription factor activates SIC1 expression during late anaphase and both sic1 and swi5 are synthetically lethal with dbf2 22 7 To address if production of new proteins is essential for exit from mitosis we examined the effects of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide on Clb2 degradation a key aspect of this process Mutant cdc15 2 cells were uniformly arrested in late anaphase telophase by incubation at the restrictive temperature 37 C The cultures were then supplemented with 0 10 or 100 g ml cycloheximide before being returned to 25 C to reverse the cdc15 2 arrest In the absence of cycloheximide Sic1 accumulated and Clb2 disappeared as cells exited mitosis Figure 1 lanes 1 4 In the presence of cycloheximide Sic1 accumulation was abolished but Clb2 degradation still occurred with apparently normal kinetics Figure 1 lanes 5 8 and 9 12 Although this result does not exclude the likely possibility that synthesis of new proteins e g Sic1 normally facilitates the exit from mitosis it reveals that a key aspect of mitotic exit inactivation of Cdc28 protein kinase via degradation of the mitotic cyclin Clb2 can proceed beyond the Cdc15 dependent step without synthesis of new proteins A screen for telophase arrest bypassed tab mutants To understand how the MEN mobilizes post translational mechanisms to trigger mitotic exit we conducted a genetic screen for telophase arrest bypassed tab mutants that bypassed the essential requirement for CDC15 Figure 2 Because the essential requirement for CLNs 1 2 and 3 in entry into S phase can be bypassed by deletion of a gene SIC1 that inhibits entry into S phase 23 24 we reasoned by analogy that our screen might reveal key negative regulators of the anaphase telophase G1 transition Ninety independent cultures of cdc15 pMET3 cdc15 2 URA3 were first grown in inducing medium methionine at permissive temperature 25 C to allow occurrence of spontaneous mutations The cultures were subsequently plated on repressing medium methionine at a temperature semi restrictive for the cdc15 2 allele 30 C to enrich for mutations that supported the growth of CDC15 deficient cells To identify mutations that allowed complete bypass of cdc15 representative colonies from each plate were tested for their ability to grow on 5 FOA containing medium 5 FOA selectively blocks the growth of plasmid bearing URA3 cells The parental strain failed to grow due to its inability to proliferate without the MET3 cdc15 2 URA3 plasmid In contrast twenty five mutants survived on 5 FOA Furthermore all of them had lost the plasmid as determined by PCR analysis data not shown Fifteen of these mutants were amenable to genetic manipulation and harbored single mutations Fourteen mutants were assigned to three recessive and three semi dominant dominant linkage groups Table 2 We referred to these mutants as tab mutants for their telophase arrest bypass Tab phenotype In addition we serendipitously found that srp1 31 but not srp1 49 could bypass cdc15 Table 2 data not shown Earlier studies identified tab2 and TAB6 as mutations in NET1 and CDC14 respectively 15 18 Net1 detains Cdc14 in the nucleolus and inactivates it until a Tem1 dependent signal sets Cdc14 free to promote exit from mitosis 15 16 17 The fact that both Net1 and Cdc14 are directly involved in exit from mitosis prompted us to further analyze tab mutants Does bypass of cdc15 require Sic1 accumulation and Clb2 degradation Either Sic1 accumulation or Clb2 degradation is proposed to be sufficient to sustain mitotic exit 3 Although cdc15 2 mutants are defective in both processes ectopic activation of either one should restore exit from mitosis and growth Thus to gain insight into their molecular targets we asked if bypass of cdc15 by tab mutations required SIC1 or HCT1 Whereas all tab mutants tested were able to bypass cdc15 in the absence of HCT1 and two net1 tab 2 1and CDC14 TAB 6 1 were able to bypass cdc15 in the absence of either SIC1 or HCT1 four tab mutants tab1 1 tab3 1 TAB5 1 and TAB7 1 failed to bypass in the absence of SIC1 Table 3 Efficient bypass of mitotic arrest by both SIC1 dependent and SIC1 independent tabmutants is accompanied by ectopic Sic1 accumulation and Clb2 degradation We have previously shown that both net1 tab 2 1and CDC14 TAB 6 1efficiently bypassed the mitotic arrest caused by Tem1 depletion 15 18 Furthermore bypass was accompanied by ectopic Sic1 accumulation and Clb2 degradation Because both net1 tab 2 1and CDC14 TAB 6 1could bypass cdc15 in the absence of SIC1 we tested if the same bypass efficiency could be achieved by tab3 1 a SIC1 dependent bypass mutant We used a tem1 GAL1 UPL TEM1 strain that allowed for conditional depletion of Tem1 15 to impose a conditional late mitotic block and introduced the tab3 1 mutation into this background Wild type or tab3 1 derivatives of tem1 GAL1 UPL TEM1 were grown in galactose medium TEM1 induced arrested in G1 with factor and released into glucose containing medium to repress TEM1 expression time 0 As expected the majority 80 of TAB cells arrested with large buds In the tab3 1 strain however a significant fraction 36 of cells had 3 cell bodies at 12 hours after release indicating that they had undergone at least one extra round of budding Figure 3A Thirty six percent represents a minimum estimate of TEM1 bypass efficiency in tab3 1 cultures since cells with 1 2 cell bodies could have arisen from bypass events followed by successful cell separation Having established that tab3 1 indeed bypassed Tem1 deficiency at a cellular level we tested whether Sic1 accumulation and Clb2 degradation two hallmark events that accompany exit from mitosis also occurred tem1 GAL1 UPL TEM1 cells carrying TAB3 or tab3 1 alleles were arrested in G1 with factor and released into glucose medium TEM1 repressed time 0 After cells had exited G1 factor was added back to stop cells from cycling beyond the next G1 phase As Tem1 depleted TAB3 cells exited G1 Clb2 accumulated and remained at high levels whereas Sic1 was degraded and remained at low levels Figure 3B left panels In contrast as Tem1 depleted tab3 1 cells progressed through mitosis Clb2 was almost completely degraded and Sic1 accumulated to high levels Figure 3B right panels These data suggest that like tab2 1 and TAB6 1 tab3 1 efficiently bypassed tem1 by enabling Tem1 independent degradation of Clb2 and accumulation of Sic1 We conclude that the apparent SIC1 dependence of bypass by tab3 1 and other tab mutants relates more to the strength of the particular mutation rather than the mechanism of bypass In support of this hypothesis we recently observed that the SIC1 independent bypass mutant 15D2 is allelic to the SIC1 dependent tab1 1 mutant R Azzam unpublished data tab2 1bypasses multiple deletion mutants of MEN All MEN genes are required for exit from mitosis but it has not yet been tested whether this is the sole essential function of all MEN genes or if some MEN genes play critical roles in other processes This question is amplified by the observations that Cdc5 participates in both chromosome segregation and cytokinesis 25 26 Park et al submitted Mob1 binds an essential protein kinase involved in spindle pole body duplication 27 and Tem1 Cdc15 Dbf2 and Mob1 have all been implicated in cytokinesis 28 29 30 31 reviewed in 1 The tab mutants provide a unique opportunity to address this issue Accordingly we tested if net1 tab 2 1could bypass deletion mutants of other MEN genes net1 tab 2 1bypassed cdc15 tem1 dbf2 dbf20 mob1 but not cdc14 Figure 4A 15 In addition it bypassed cdc5 with negligible 1000 10 000 fold lower efficiency Fig 4A suggesting that although the sole essential function of CDC15 TEM1 DBF2 and MOB1 is to drive cells out of mitosis CDC5 has other critical cellular functions Some but not all tabmutants exhibit additional phenotypes including growth defects perturbations in the nucleolus and elevated rates of chromosome loss To further characterize the tab mutants we tested whether they display other phenotypes in an otherwise wild type background tab mutants grown to exponential phase at 25 C and shifted to 37 C for 3 or 6 hours did not arrest at a particular stage of the cell cycle data not shown When tab mutants were plated on YPD plates and grown at 37 C TAB5 and TAB7 grew normally Table 2 suggesting that bypass of CDC15 does not necessarily cause defective growth However tab1 failed to form colonies and net1 tab 2 1 tab3 and CDC14 TAB 6 1grew slowly at 37 C suggesting that at least some tab mutations reside in genes that have multiple functions Indeed NET1 additionally modulates nucleolar structure and transcription 16 18 The release of Cdc14 from nucleolar Net1 promotes mitotic exit 15 17 18 net1 tab 2 1cells display a panel of nucleolar defects including reduction of nucleolar silencing mislocalization of nucleolar antigens alteration of rDNA morphology and reduction of rRNA synthesis 16 18 To test whether perturbation of nucleolar structure is consistently associated with bypass of cdc15 we immunolocalized the nucleolar antigen Nop1 in all tab mutants Nop1 localization was also perturbed in tab1 1 and srp1 31 but was normal in tab3 TAB5 TAB6 and TAB7 cells Table 2 18 suggesting that a gross change in nucleolar structure is not required for bypass Because the putative Tem1 antagonists and mitotic checkpoint proteins Bub2 and Bfa1 negatively regulate exit from mitosis and cytokinesis in response to both DNA damage and spindle misorientation 32 reviewed in 33 we asked whether bypass of TEM1 dependent regulation can cause chromosome instability All tab mutants are in the W303 background in which the ade2 1 mutation makes colonies red after adenine in the growth medium has been depleted A URA3 marked tester mini chromosome carrying the SUP11 suppressor transfer RNA gene 34 was introduced into net1 tab 2 1and CDC14 TAB 6 1 the two tab mutants with well characterized bypass mechanisms Cells that retain the mini chromosome should form white colonies due to suppression of ade2 1 by SUP11 whereas loss of this chromosome should result in a red sector or sectors The extent of chromosome loss expressed as colonies that were red or had red sectors was low in wild type and CDC14 TAB 6 1cells 5 and high 94 in net1 tab 2 1cells Figure 5 In comparison in a strain lacking the anaphase inhibitor Pds1 18 of the colonies suffered chromosome loss events Figure 5 Since net1 tab 2 1but not CDC14 TAB 6 1also perturbs nucleolar functions 18 CDC14 TAB 6 1is a more specific and representative bypass mutant Thus TEM1 regulation can be short circuited without a major effect on chromosome loss Consistent with this notion cells lacking Bub2 an inhibitor of Tem1 showed a similarly moderate extent of chromosome loss 5 Figure 5 We propose that additional functions of Net1 ensure faithful transmission of chromosomes Molecular cloning of TABgenes and implication of nuclear transport in the regulation of mitotic exit We attempted to clone by complementation genes corresponding to the recessive tab mutations by exploiting the fact that all of the recessive tab mutants are ts for growth see below By this approach TAB1 was revealed to be MTR10 a gene previously implicated in nuclear transport 35 36 37 We were unable to isolate plasmids that complemented tab3 in all libraries tested Both MTR10 TAB1 and SRP1 belong to the nuclear transport receptor adaptor family reviewed by 38 Mutant srp1 31 and mtr10 tab 1 1cells accumulate the ribosomal protein Rpb11b in the nucleus 39 Thus to evaluate a potential link between nuclear transport and the tab phenotype we evaluated the localization of Rpl11b GFP 39 in all tab mutants Mutants expressing Rpl11b GFP were grown to early log phase at 25 C shifted to 37 C to induce the ts mutant phenotype which also reduces synthesis of ribosomal proteins including Rpl11b and shifted back to 25 C to induce new ribosomal protein synthesis If the rate of mutant phenotype reversal is slower than restoration of ribosome synthesis then Rpl11b should accumulate in the nucleus Whereas Rpl11b GFP was distributed relatively evenly in wild type cells it accumulated in the nucleus in a significant fraction of srp1 31 and net1 tab 2 1cells at 25 C and after 25 C 37 C 25 C shift Figure 6 39 In addition although mtr10 tab 1 1cells were relatively normal at 25 C 30 of them accumulated nuclear Rpl11b after 25 C 37 C 25 C shift Figure 6 Thus multiple tab mutants accumulate Rpl11b in the nucleus implying that nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is involved in the regulation of mitotic exit Other tab mutants such as tab3 TAB5 CDC14 TAB 6and TAB7 showed no defect in this assay suggesting that bypass of cdc15 can be achieved without perturbing nucleocytoplasmic transport Discussion MEN A signalling network that can post translationally trigger exit from mitosis Both transcriptional and post translational controls have been implicated in the operation of the Mitotic Exit Network and the regulation of the anaphase telophase G1 transition 40 7 19 41 To address whether the portion of the MEN that acts downstream of CDC15 can trigger a key aspect of the anaphase telophase G1 transition i e inactivation of Clb Cdc28 via proteolysis of Clb2 in the absence of new gene expression we evaluated the turnover of Clb2 in cells released from a cdc15 2 arrest in the presence of cycloheximide Interestingly Clb2 was rapidly and efficiently degraded upon reversal of the cdc15 2 block regardless of whether cycloheximide was present Figure 1 although both cytokinesis and cell separation require protein synthesis 42 This observation suggests that the exit from mitosis in budding yeast may be controlled by mechanisms fundamentally similar to those employed by animal cells which proceed through mitosis with highly condensed transcriptionally silent chromosomes Interestingly all of the MEN genes have putative homologues in the C elegans genome http genome www stanford edu Saccharomyces worm Isolation of tabmutants A deliberate search for bypass mutants was a key aspect of the screen reported here since numerous genetic interactions have been observed among components of the MEN consult 9 for a summary Formally speaking it is not possible to order gene functions based on suppressive interactions involving reduction of function e g ts alleles For example the net1 1 allele suppressed ts mutations in both its downstream target CDC14 and its upstream regulators CDC5 CDC15 and DBF2 Figure 4B Since we sought mutants that bypassed cdc15 the tab genes are predicted to function either downstream of or parallel to CDC15 but not upstream of CDC15 The tab screen yielded both dominant and recessive mutants which mapped to six linkage groups The pattern of alleles Table 2 does not satisfy a Poisson distribution suggesting that the screen has not reached saturation The recessive tab mutants are likely to represent reduction of function mutations in genes that inhibit exit from mitosis and the dominant TAB mutants are likely to result from gain of function mutations in genes that promote exit from mitosis This prediction is supported by our prior characterization of the tab2 1 and TAB6 1 alleles of NET1 and CDC14 respectively see next section The fact that we recovered recessive semi dominant and dominant mutants in additional tab genes suggests that there are likely to be multiple dosage sensitive positive and negative regulatory controls that act downstream of or parallel to CDC15 tab mutants can be classified into two groups those that bypass cdc15 only in the presence of SIC1 e g tab3 1 and those that can bypass in the absence of SIC1 e g net1 tab 2 1and CDC14 TAB 6 1 It remains unclear whether mutants distribute into these classes based on bypass mechanism or allelic potency but we favor the latter possibility because some tab1 alleles required SIC1 to bypass cdc15 whereas others did not R Azzam unpublished data Importantly tab mutants from both classes appeared to bypass mitotic arrest in Tem1 depleted cells by enabling degradation of Clb2 and accumulation of Sic1 two hall marks of mitotic exit Figure 3 15 18 A genetic pathway for anaphase G1 transition Biochemical and cell biological experiments indicate that Net1 acts as part of a complex named RENT that tethers Cdc14 to the nucleolus and inhibits Cdc14 phosphatase activity and that CDC15 and TEM1 are required for the release of Cdc14 from Net1 at the end of mitosis 15 16 17 43 Consistent with this notion both net1 tab 2 1 which encodes a mutant version of Net1 with presumably reduced affinity for Cdc14 and CDC14 TAB 6 1 which encodes a mutant version of Cdc14 with reduced affinity for Tab2 Net1 bypass cdc15 15 18 Both net1 tab 2 1and CDC14 TAB 6 1impinge directly on mitotic exit suggesting that other TAB genes may encode physiological regulators and effectors of the Mitotic Exit Network The net1 tab 2 1mutation efficiently bypassed tem1 cdc15 dbf2 dbf20 and mob1 consistent with the notion that the sole essential function of all these genes is to inhibit Net1 net1 tab 2 1failed to bypass cdc14 because Cdc14 is the downstream target of Net1 15 17 Cdc5 also regulates Net1 Shou et al manuscript in preparation but net1 tab 2 1bypassed cdc5 with very low efficiency presumably because CDC5 has other essential functions 44 25 26 45 The most parsimonious model that unifies all of these observations is as follows Tem1 functions upstream of Cdc15 which in turn activates the Dbf2 Mob1 protein kinase complex 46 47 48 49 Together with Cdc5 these proteins dislodge Cdc14 from nucleolar Net1 Cdc14 subsequently dephosphorylates and thereby activates proteins involved in Sic1 expression Swi5 and C1b degradation Hct1 Cdh1 19 41 50 thereby eliminating mitotic Cdk activity and promoting exit from mitosis The mechanisms by which Cdc5 and Dbf2 Mob1 promote the disassembly of RENT remain unknown raising the possibility that other Tab proteins serve as intermediaries in this process One attractive hypothesis based on our identification of MTR10 as a tab gene is that MEN proteins regulate the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of a key regulator of the release process Chromosome instability in tabmutants The Bub2 Bfa1 GTPase activating protein GAP complex inhibits the MEN and cytokinesis in response to DNA damage and spindle misorientation 32 reviewed in 33 bub2 and CDC14 TAB 6 1cells show similar chromosome instability as wild type cells In contrast net1 tab 2 1cells have a dramatic chromosome instability phenotype with some colonies showing multiple red sectors indicative of multiple chromosome loss events and many colonies completely red on the surface Figure 5A Net1 is unlikely to directly regulate transmission of the tester chromosome because it is only localized to rDNA in the nucleolus 15 16 17 Thus the difference between net1 tab 2 1and CDC14 TAB 6 1presumably results from molecular defects unique to the former mutant including defective nucleolar structure and function or perhaps defective nuclear transport 18 Figure 6 Further study is required to reveal how the multifunctional Net1 protein helps to ensure chromosome transmission fidelity Multiple tabmutations influence nucleocytoplasmic transport Nuclear transport defective mutations in MTR10 and SRP1 mtr10 tab 1 1and srp1 31 respectively bypassed cdc15 Mtr10 assembles with and functions as a nuclear import receptor for the mRNA binding protein Npl3 36 37 Interestingly srp1 31 also inhibits nuclear import of multiple proteins including Npl3 51 52 Remarkably reduction of function alleles of the karyopherin KAP104 were also recovered in a screen for mutations that suppressed cdc15 2 ts A Toh e personal communication KAP104 is required for proper localization of mRNA binding proteins Nab2 and Hrp1 to the nucleus 53 The only phenotype known to be shared by srp1 mtr10 and kap104 mutants is accumulation of the 60S ribosomal protein Rpl11b in the nucleus 39 SRP1 MTR10 and KAP104 may also collaborate to maintain the proper nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of factor or factors that regulates mitotic exit An alternative possibility is that they sequester an inactive stockpile of factor that upon mutation or signalling by the MEN is released from these transportins and enables exit from mitosis 54 55 Finally it is possible that the transportin mutants enable bypass through an indirect perturbation of nucleolar architecture Table 2 Given that some of the MEN proteins reside in the cytoplasm whereas their target the RENT complex resides in the nucleolus it is tempting to speculate that nuclear transport is a target of MEN action Our failure to observe nuclear accumulation of Rpl11b in tab3 and TAB5 TAB7 mutants suggests that these tab genes bypassed cdc15 by a distinct mechanism Regardless of the exact mechanisms of bypass it is clear from these analyses that the release of Cdc14 from Net1 is more intricately connected to cell regulation than was previously imagined Conclusions Three main conclusions on how exit from mitosis is regulated in the budding yeast can be derived First the sole essential function of the Tem1 Cdc15 Dbf2 Dbf20 and Mob1 but not Cdc5 proteins are to promote the release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus as cells lacking these proteins can grow upon simultaneous reduction of NET1 activity Second high chromosome loss rate was observed in net1 tab 2 1but not CDC14 TAB 6 1 suggesting that although CDC15 independent mitotic exit does not dramatically affect chromosome transmission additional functions of Net1 do Third both mtr10 tab 1 1and srp1 31 affect nuclear transport suggesting that nuclear transport regulates mitotic exit Materials and Methods Strains and plasmids All yeast strains used in this study listed in Table 1 are isogenic to W303 Standard methods were employed for the culturing and manipulation of yeast 56 All plasmid constructions were based on the pRS vector series 57 To replace CDC15 with TRP1 polymerase chain reaction PCR products containing TRP1 flanked by 200 base pair bp homology to the 5 and 3 untranslated regions of the targeted gene were used to transform diploid strain RJD381 Correct integrants were verified by PCR using primers that amplified a DNA fragment that spanned the recombination junction Deletions of CDC5 and TEM1 were carried out similarly To construct pMET3 CDC15 URA3 pWS100 and pMET3 cdc15 2 URA3 pWS109 the corresponding genes from start codon to 300 bps downstream of the stop codon were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of wild type RJD381 or cdc15 2 RJD619 cells and cloned into the SpeI and SacII sites of RDB620 a derivative of pRS316 containing the MET3 promoter inserted between the HindIII and EcoRI sites Isolation of tabmutants The scheme is outlined in Figure 2 Ninety independent cultures of cdc15 pMET3 cdc15 2 URA3 WY221 were grown at 25 C in synthetic minimal medium 2 glucose SD in the absence of methionine For each culture 8 10 6cells were plated on SD methionine 2 mM at 30 C to simultaneously repress expression and partially inactivate the cdc15 2 allele One to two colonies were picked from each plate and tested for viability on SD 5 fluoroorotic acid 5 FOA plates 58 When more than one colony was picked from a single plate care was taken to pick colonies of different size or morphology Out of 90 colonies tested 25 survived on 5 FOA medium Tab PCR analysis confirmed that all twenty five colonies had lost the pMET3 cdc15 2 URA3 plasmid indicating that they were true bypassers of cdc15 Mutant characterization To determine if Tab phenotypes were due to single mutations cdc15 tab strains were crossed to cdc15 pMET3 cdc15 2 URA3 and the resulting diploids were sporulated and dissected Approximately 50 of the viable spores should bypass cdc15 as indicated by 5 FOA resistance if the Tab phenotype was due to a single mutation Out of twenty five mutants fifteen satisfied this criterion and the other ten were discarded because they either failed to sporulate or yielded few viable spores after dissection or did not segregate as single mutations The same crosses were also used to determine if Tab was recessive or dominant for every tab mutant haploid cdc15 tab pMET3 cdcl5 2 URA3 and diploid cdc15 cdc15 tab pMET3 cdc15 2 URA3 cells were pre grown on YPD 1 yeast extract 2 peptone 2 glucose at 25 C for 2 3 days spotted in 5 fold serial dilutions onto SD 5 FOA plates and the number of 5 FOA resistant colonies from the diploid was divided by that from the haploid to obtain ratio P The mutant was defined to be dominant if P 0 1 1 semi dominant if P 0 01 0 1 and recessive if P 0 01 To introduce tab mutations into the wild type background cdc15 tab strains were crossed to CDC15 TAB and tab spores were verified by crossing to cdc15 pMET3 CDC15 URA3 and demonstrating that half of the resulting cdc15 segregants were 5 FOA resistant All cdc15 tab mutants were also crossed to strains harboring either pMET3 CDC15 URA3 pRS313 HIS3 or pMET3 CDC15 URA3 pRS315 LEU2 to introduce these plasmids The resulting strains grew better than the original cdc15 tab strains and harbored selectable markers that facilitated subsequent crosses To test whether net1 tab 2 1can bypass tem1 dbf2 dbf20 mob1 cdc14 and cdc5 we crossed net1 tab 2 1 WY39 to WY218 WY280 WY288 WY243 and WY214 respectively The diploids were sporulated and if 50 of the MEN deleted spores were resistant to 5 FOA then net1 1 could bypass the MEN null mutation To test temperature sensitivity ts of tab mutants cells were spotted or streaked onto YPD plates and incubated at 37 C Their growth was scored after one to two days Nop1 immunolocalization was performed as described earlier 15 The chromosome loss assay was carried out using a strain 34 backcrossed into the W303 background by F Uhlmann When cells were pre grown in YPD liquid instead of SD URA solid media before being tested on YPD plates the percentage of colonies that were red or had red sectors remained similar for wild type CDC14 TAB 6 1 and bub2 strains but was 25 for net1 tab 2 1 This number was lower than the 94 value observed in Figure 5 but still significantly higher than the wild type value 5 Linkage analysis To assign tab mutants to linkage groups cdc15 tab pMET3 CDC15 URA3 strains were crossed against each other and the diploids were sporulated and dissected If two tab mutations belonged to the same linkage group then all spores were expected to survive on 5 FOA Otherwise approximately one quarter of the spores would fail to bypass cdc15 The alleles of TAB2 TAB3 TAB5 TAB6 and TAB7 see Table 2 were assigned this way The recessive tab mutants exhibited a ts growth phenotype that co segregated with the Tab phenotype Complementation tests were used to assign two of the ts mutations as alleles of tab 1 After TAB1 was shown to be MTR10 other tab1 alleles were ascertained by their linkage to the MTR10 locus Molecular cloning of TAB1and TAB2 To clone TAB1 and TAB2 tab1 1 and tab2 1 mutant strains were transformed with plasmid libraries harboring yeast genomic DNA fragments and incubated at 25 C for one day before being shifted to 37 C 59 Libraries constructed by the laboratories of P Heiter ATCC 77164 and R Young 60 rescued tab1 1 and a 2 library ATCC 37323 61 rescued tab2 1 Transformants enough to cover multiple genome equivalents were screened and plasmids retrieved from colonies that grew at 37 C were re transformed into the original mutant strain to verify their complementation activity Candidate plasmids were sequenced and the genomic regions containing the complementing activity were identified TAB1 resided on Chromosome XV 631 500 637 950 and TAB2 on Chromosome X 291 900 299 466 To confirm that these genomic fragments indeed carried the TAB genes complementing fragments were cloned into the integrating vector pRS305 LEU2 and linearized to target integration into the tab locus in a cdc15 TRP1 tab pMET3 CDC15 URA3 strain The transformants lost their Tab phenotype and when crossed to cdc15 TRP1 pMET3 CDC15 URA3 the diploid yielded no spores that could bypass cdc15 n 40 50 Since both genomic fragments contained multiple open reading frames ORFs each ORF was amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA and cloned into the integrating plasmid pRS305 The resulting plasmids were transformed into cdc15 TRP1 tab pMET3 CDC15 URA3 to identify the ORF that reversed the Tab phenotype This analysis revealed TAB1 to be MTR10 and TAB2 to be YJL076W NET1 Gene replacement For gene replacement the Schizosaccharomyces pombe his5 PCR amplification transformation method was used 62 Correct integrants were verified by PCR using primers that amplified a DNA fragment that spanned the recombination junction To assay if SIC 1 or HCT1 was required for the Tab phenotype of tab mutants SIC1 or HCT1 was replaced by his5 in cdc15 TRP1 tab pMET3 CDC15 URA3 strains Each transformant was assayed for the occurrence of correct integration and its ability to survive on 5 FOA Cell cycle synchronization Cells were grown in 1 yeast extract 2 peptone YP with 2 glucose YPD 2 galactose YPG or 2 raffinose YPR For the experiment described in Figure 1 cdc15 2 RJD 619 cells were grown to exponential phase in YPD at 25 C and shifted to 37 C for three hours so that 95 cells were arrested as large budded cells Cycloheximide CHX was supplemented to a final concentration of 0 10 or 100 g ml to inhibit translation and factor 10 g ml was added to trap cells in the subsequent Gl phase After five minutes the cultures were released to 25 C at time 0 Samples were taken at various time points after release The experiment in Figure 3was carried out as previously described 15 Cell extract preparation and protein detection Detection of proteins from crude yeast extracts was as described 15 The following primary antibodies were used in immunoblotting anti Sic1 1 8000 anti Clb2 1 2500 anti Cdc28 1 3000 and 12CA5 directed against the haemagglutinin HA epitope 1 1000 with 0 5 M NaCl The first three antibodies were raised in rabbits and affinity purified and the last one was from mouse
