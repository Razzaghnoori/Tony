 Movies The Apostle October Films Actor director writer Robert Duvall s film about a Pentecostal preacher who beats his wife s lover into a coma is deemed the best movie ever about a man of God David Denby New York The film s strength is said to be its uncompromising psychological complexity It shows the preacher as both very good and extremely evil without lapsing into moral condemnation Unlike most films about evangelicalism it is not a condescending put down of redneck religion David Ansen Newsweek The most vigorous plaudits go to Duvall s performance critics predict that it will revive his career from a slump and win him an Oscar nomination The movie is plugged here Oscar and Lucinda Fox Searchlight Pictures Critics debate the merits of Australian director Gillian Armstrong My

Television Seinfeld NBC Thursdays 9 p m ET PT Critics laud Jerry Seinfeld s decision to retire his sitcom after this season leaving at the top of his game Albert Kim Entertainment Weekly They say the show s shtick a comedy about self involved people doing goofy things had begun to wear thin Appreciations deem the nine season old show the best of its era and a trenchant critique of late 20 th century social mores Television s first genuine comedy of manners since Leave It to Beaver says Time s Bruce Handy Prediction Seinfeld s departure will end NBC s prime time hegemony with Fox filling the void NBC trumpets its prize show Books Truman Capote In Which Various Friends Enemies Acquaintances and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career by George Plimpton Nan A Talese Doubleday A gossipfest about the notorious novelist and gadabout Most critics take the opportunity to sum up Capote s career They recall with regret that Capote spent more time schmoozing than writing and deem his work less memorable than his social appearances particularly at his fabled 1966 Black and White Ball and on the Tonight Show Critics also chide Plimpton for rehashing rather than investigating old accusations such as Capote s alleged lying and drinking problems The New York Times Christopher Lehmann Haupt calls the compilation fluff while the New York Review of Books Elizabeth Hardwick thinks

Ferguson takes the field of evolutionary psychology to task by attacking its standard bearer How the Mind Works author Steven Pinker According to Ferguson Pinker s seeming endorsement of infanticide in a recent New York Times Magazine article exposes the ethical failings of the wildly popular new branch of science Ferguson echoing a charge made by Washington Post columnist Michael Kelly says that Pinker wants us to see infanticide not as a moral horror but as a genetically encoded evolutionary adaptation as unavoidable as depth perception or opposable thumbs Pinker has denied the accusation arguing that he is trying to understand infanticidal behavior not condoning it Recent Summary Judgment columns Dec 31 Winter Movie Roundup Dec 24 The Year in Review in Review Dec 17 Movie Titanic
