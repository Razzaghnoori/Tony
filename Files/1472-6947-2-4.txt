                    Background        Health care providers compete for managed care contracts        based on costeffectiveness and quality of care               Information technology IT provides a costeffective way        to document productivity performance measures cost and        quality of care Since IT has dropped in cost over time        physician practices are now turning to it to meet these        needs Information technology for this study is defined as        computer software used to store transport or communicate        information               The health care organizations that succeed in the         stcentury will be those that improve quality and reduce        cost These juxtaposed objectives most likely will be        reached through improved handling of information              The Committee on Quality of Health Care in America        reported that most clinical information remains in paper        form     This committee made several recommendations        for improving quality including moving clinical        information to an electronic format by the end of the        decade        Information technology selection in health care has        often been performed in a rather informal way resulting in        the purchase of white elephants     The systems may        not perform as planned and may cause additional work for        medical staff The systems are often purchased or developed        in pieces without consideration to the overall business        strategy            To date few publications have documented the selection        process and the resulting impact of the IT on the health        care organization Most papers give anecdotal descriptions        often by vendors but lack client perceptions of the        information systems value           Even at        the hospital level only a few client perceptions of IT        adoption have been reported         The number        of available papers that examine IT selections within        physician practices is even smaller than those papers        addressing hospital selections      However many        physicians are transitioning from paper to electronic        formats for billing records medical charts etc This        study aims to understand the process for selecting IT for        physicians practices and the perceptions of the IT after        it is implemented         The primary objective of this research        was to identify the relationship if any between the IT        selection process and the office staffs perceptions of the        its impact on practice activities                     Methods                  Sample          Providence Health System in Portland Oregon provided          a database of practices n   for this study These          practices all served Providence Health System in some          capacity  eg as primary care physicians or          specialists Eligible practices had acquired software          within the past five years but not within the past six          months Practices with software older than five years          were disqualified because it was unlikely that the          decision makers if present would recall the details of          the selection process Practices with software selected          within the last six months were dropped because new          software often requires a learning time period The          original sample of  contained  practices that had no          computers and  that had software purchased only in past          six months or more than five years ago In total           of the original sample were excluded          Of the remaining eligible practices n             completed the telephone survey representing a response          rate of  If a qualified respondent at a practice          was not reached after at least three attempts n            or the respondents declined the interview n   the          practice was counted as a nonrespondent Qualified          respondents were involved with software selection or          software customization for the practice Seven practices          gave partial interviews and were also counted as          nonrespondents These respondents had to leave in the          middle of the interview to address urgent clinic needs          Although these respondents were rescheduled they were          not reached to complete the interviews Additionally one          respondent gave many dont know responses The          interviewer wrote in the comment section for this office          that the respondent was not qualified for the study and          should be dropped Thus in total seven partial          interviews and one unqualified interview were dropped          from the sample reducing the total number of offices in          the study to  The respondents and participating          practices are summarized in Table           Second interviews were gathered for  of the           responding practices Since almost half of the responding          offices represented single practitioners many of these          smaller offices had only one eligible participant                          Telephone survey          The survey questions were developed based on the          literature review and discussions with an expert panel          Since many of the respondents were not familiar with          technical IT terms care was taken to present the survey          in a respondent friendly format          Thirteen college student interviewers and two          supervisors conducted the interviews using a telephone          interviewing software package Computer Assisted Survey          Execution System A program was written to provide the          interviewers with precise dialogue questions and          precoded responses As the interview progressed the          interviewer entered the responses into a personal          computer          Since the study objective included capturing the          perceived impacts of IT we attempted to record          perceptions from two representatives from each practice          the decision maker and a primary user see Additional          File  Physician Practice Software Telephone Survey          Dialog and Questions The initial interview that          included questions related to the selection process and          perceived impacts of the IT lasted approximately           minutes The respondent was asked to describe a recent IT          purchase at least six months old For each practice          the respondent indicated whether a person in a specific          role  eg an administrator  was involved or not          involved in selection and involved or not involved in          software customization Customization in this study          referred to providing input to the software vendor for          writing software specific to the practice          During the interview we read the respondents a list of          selection steps For each step the respondent answered          yes or no as to whether it was performed During the          interview the respondents were read several potential          factors that might have influenced the purchase For each          one they rated the statement on a to scale of          importance ranging from no importance to very high          importance Finally we asked the respondents to react          to  statements describing potential impacts of the IT          on selected practice activities The statements were          intentionally not grouped by any particular theme The          respondents rated each impact statement on a to scale          of agreement strongly disagree slightly disagree          neither agree or disagree slightly agree strongly          agree or selected not applicable          The second interview with a primary user of the          software included mainly the perceived impact questions          and lasted  minutes At the completion of the initial          interview each respondent was offered a summary of the          results          Additional file           Scripted telephone survey Physician Practice          Software Telephone

all interviews were first descriptively          evaluated primarily by computing frequencies of          responses for each question Factor analysis principal          components revealed four latent factors related to the          respondents perceived impacts of the IT on four practice          activities scheduling financial analysis          communication and medical documentation              Therefore four subscales were created The scheduling          financial analysis communication subscales each included          two items and the medical documentation subscale          included three items Responses of not applicable were          coded as missing For each subscale the mean of the items          was computed          Diagnostic plots of the four practice activity          subscales suggested that an explanatory model might be          best approached using logistic regression which relaxes          the assumption of normality The four subscales were          recoded to dichotomous variables corresponding to           agree or           not agree If the mean score of           impact statements for a practice activity was          greater than  the respondent was scored as  for           agree If the mean score for a          practice activity was  neither agree or disagree          or less the respondent was scored as  for           not agree Each of the four          practice activity subscales became the dependent variable          in a predictive model The independent variables entered          into the models included the demographic and selection          variables                          Multiple logistic regression          We attempted four predictive models one for each of          the newly created dichotomous subscales Only respondents          who found the impact statements relevant were included in          the predictive models Multiple logistic regression          revealed relationships between the selection process and          the perceptions related to the scheduling financial          analysis and communication processes Variables that          achieved a significance level of p   were retained          in the models For the perceptions related to medical          documentation no significant selection variables          survived the analysis This was most likely due to the          small number of practices with electronic medical records          n   and aggregating all types of electronic medical          record EMRs regardless of type and number of functions          It is also possible that the decision to purchase an EMR          is often made outside the practice  eg a large health          system offers EMRs to the practices For  of the           practices that had EMRs the decision was made by a large          health system Data from these practices were not          included in the predictive models thus reducing the          number of available practices with EMRs to           A summary of the models is presented in this paper          The complete analysis and models are available elsewhere              The predictive models were built using a model          building data set  randomly selected interviews The          models were then tested with a testing data set the          remaining  interviews Onehundred interviews were          needed to insure adequate statistical power As a check          for crossvalidation the accuracy with which the models          predicted the perceived impact subscale values using the          model building data set was compared to the accuracy          achieved with the testing data set Using the parameters          established with the model building data set agreement          or not agreement to a perceived impact subscale was          predicted for the testing data set          For crossvalidation the accuracy levels were          compared using a ztest for proportions As seen in Table           the scheduling and financial analysis models had          nonsignificant p   drops in accuracy This          suggests that the models may be generalized to other          physician offices with similar demographics Since the          accuracy level dropped dramatically for the communication          model this model did not crossvalidate The          observations made in this study accurately describe the          idiosyncrasies of this sample used to build the          communication model but may not accurately describe          other samples of physician offices          Once the results were completed the expert panel was          reconvened to provide insight in interpreting the          results In the sections that follow the descriptive          results comparison of the decision maker vs user and          each crossvalidated model are summarized and          discussed                            Results and Discussion                  Comparison of decisionmaker vs user          The primary respondents agreed with users on their          perceptions of the softwares impact on scheduling and          financial analysis activities p   For the          scheduling model Phi was  with a maximal Phi of           For the financial analysis model Phi was  with          a maximal Phi of  Since the primary respondent was          reasonably knowledgeable about the perceived impacts of          the software we did not include the user data in the          remainder of the crossvalidated models The user          provided only a few demographics and the perceived impact          data while the primary respondent provided the selection          data as well as the perceived impact data                          Predicting the impact of the software on scheduling          activities          For the scheduling model five selection variables as          a group predicted with  accuracy the subscale of          whether the respondents on average would agree with the          following two impact statements          The software has improved the scheduling of patients          for routine preventive and urgent appointments          The software has improved the referral process in          sending and receiving referrals quickly          The statistically significant p   predictors          are presented in Table along with the expected response          by the respondent and the results of the multiple          logistic regression analysis The second column of the          table contains the coefficient or weighting value of B          The Wald statistic Bjstandard error gives a measure of          significance of B for the predictor variable          Looking at the odds ratios in Table  the likelihood          of agreement with the scheduling subscale is almost four          times odds ratio OR   as great when practices          selected EMR packages than if they did not select EMR          packages At first this finding was surprising Many          EMRs however have automatic recall features when the          patient should be called or sent a reminder for a health          check Similarly the likelihood of agreement was almost          four times OR   as great when the practice          compared the software options with the best in the field          than if it did not perform this step          The practices that selected practice management          software were  times more likely to agree that the          software had improved the scheduling and referring of          patients than practices that selected other types of          software This finding was expected since these packages          typically include a scheduling module Additionally          practices that considered prior user testimony          important in the selection process were  times more          likely to agree with the scheduling subscale than those          practices that did not consider prior user testimony as          an important influence          Finally a respondent who had personally selected the          software was less likely to agree with the impact          statements OR   The members of the expert panel          felt this was a symptom of unmet expectations The          members of the selection team knew how the software was          supposed to perform and were likely disappointed when it          didnt live up to the vendor promises These respondents          had also probably seen the Cadillac performers and          realized that their software had only achieved          Chevrolet status Another explanation is that these          practices failed to fully implement the software or to          adapt clinic workflows to fully utilize the software          In summary practices that selected EMR or practice          management software that made software comparisons or          that considered prior user testimony as important were          more likely to have perceived improvements in the          scheduling process than were other practices                          Predicting the impact of the software on financial          analysis activities          For the financial analysis model five selection          variables as a group predicted with  accuracy the          subscale of whether the respondents on average would          agree with the following two impact statements          The software has created a more accurate and timely          billing process          The software has improved the practices ability to          track and analyze costs and revenues associated with          managed care contracts          The most dramatic increase in odds of agreement OR            occurred when the practice reduced the workload to          allow time to learn the software Table  However only           of the  practices reported that reduced workloads          were provided during the implementation phase According          to the survey conducted by Ambosa et al              expecting medical staff to learn new software while          caring for a full load of patients is a common reason for          failure          The odds of agreement were increased by more than a          factor of four OR   for each increase in managed          care activities the software contained Since most          managed care software packages are marketed to assist the          practice in documenting costs associated with managed          care contracts this finding was expected          Practices that considered value an important          consideration were twice OR   as likely to agree          with the financial analysis subscale By contrast          practices that considered compatibility an important          influence were less likely OR   to agree with          financial analysis subscale At first the compatibility          result was surprising However  of these practices          were firsttime buyers and usually buying billing          software so compatibility was not a critical          consideration Ninetyone percent of firsttime buyers          who rated compatibility as lowtono importance agreed          with the financial analysis subscale It is also possible          that practices with existing good financial analysis          processes and little room to improve rated          compatibility as important but disagreed that the new          software had improved the existing good process          The finding that less expensive packages related to          more satisfied buyers was interesting OR   There          were many good financial packages available for less than           in  Practices that spent less than           bought software packages with few but very functional          features Those practices that spent more than           were purchasing complex systems perhaps for multiple          sites Financial analysis may just have been a small          module of these multipurpose packages          In summary practices that considered value important          that did not consider compatibility important that          selected managed care software that spent less than           or that provided learning time during          implementation were more likely to perceive that the          software had improved the financial analysis process than          were other practices                          Observations from both models          In looking over the predictors for the two          crossvalidated models scheduling and financial          analysis some predictors naturally belong in one model          or the other  eg practice management software in the          scheduling model and managed care software in the          financial analysis model The themes in the scheduling          model center around software features emr and practice          management software comparison of software options and          usability prior user testimony and personal selection by          respondent The themes in the financial analysis model          include cost software cost value software features          managed care software and compatibility and learning          time This might suggest that the respondents for the          financial analysis model had differing roles in the          practice than the respondents for the scheduling model          In both of these models  of the respondents were          administrators          Since all types of administrators eg office          managers finance managers were grouped together it was          impossible to identify the primary role of administrator          who responded The differences in the models also suggest          that the predictors of success differ by the types of          activities the software is intended to perform          It might appear odd that some predictors eg          learning time did not carry through to both models It          is likely that the type and complexity of software          package contributed to the learning demands on the          office Many of the respondents who agreed with the          financial analysis subscale chose managed care software          that bundled together many activities tracking incoming          and outgoing referrals patient enrollment capitation          accounting andor utilization reporting For practices          learning this type of software protected learning time          was an important predictor of success For practices          implementing practice management software scheduling          billing andor accounting spreadsheets the learning          demand was less This naturally suggests that the          decision to reduce the workload while learning a software          package should consider the number and complexity of the          tasks to be learned                          Limitations and research opportunities          The respondents for this study primarily represented          practices that serve Providence Health System in Oregon          These practices served either as managed care providers          or as feeforservice providers The only practices          excluded were pure HMO providers  eg Kaiser          Permanente The pure HMO practices were excluded because          it was unclear whom to interview regarding software          selections Often these practices are given software          directly from the organization Eightyseven percent of          these practices in this study had  practitioners or          less Only  of these practices had inhouse computer          specialists assisting with software selection The          results of this study may not generalize to large          practices that often have inhouse computer specialists          assisting with selection A future study could include a          nationwide survey of all types of physician practices          regardless of managed care status ownership specialty          or size          This study is retrospective in nature requiring the          respondents to recall a software purchase that occurred          several months perhaps more than a year earlier In an          ideal study design a questionnaire should be          distributed to practices that have recently made          selections Another questionnaire addressing the impact          on the practice could be sent at a predefined followup          period  eg six months after implementation This          ideal study design would be difficult to conduct          without a sufficient list of practices that have recently          purchased software Perhaps software manufacturers and          vendors could provide lists of recent clients with          permission to interested researchers          The crosssectional survey design of this study          captured the technical aspects of the selection process          eg who was involved what steps that were taken          Although the respondents were given a few openended          questions most provided little additional information          There could have been additional selection steps          influences and impacts It is also possible that the          observed changes in impact were related to variables we          didnt attempt to measure  eg ability and desire of          management to implement new technologies and to change          existing practice activities Focus groups might be more          effective at capturing underlying management expertise          Another very timeinvasive approach would be to conduct a          series of case studies documenting the decisionmaking          process over time This research would need support from          practices for observers to remain onsite during the          selection process This format would also promote a more          wellrounded multiple perspectives evaluation The          current study relies on perceptive responses primarily          from office managers to measure many variables          including impact variables Their perceptions were          related to businessrelated practice activities Only           of the respondents were clinicians It is likely          that expanding this study to include more clinician          responses would reveal perceptions related to other          processes  eg medical documentation or treatment          processes          The subscales related to practice activities were          formed from responses to only two to three original          impact questions A stronger design of these practice          activities impacts would include several questions          related to each activity Given the exploratory nature of          this current research this limitation could not have          been foreseen However the results of this study open          doors for more confirmatory types of studies to design          survey instruments that measure software impact with          underlying practice activity constructs This study does          not attempt to demonstrate cause and effect It would be          important to have respondents rate existing practice          activities before purchasing software to control for a          ceiling effect  practices with existing good processes          have little room to improve If such a trial were          designed it would also need to control for the type of          IT and the needs of the buyer          To move toward a more direct measure of impact would          require the practices to closely measure performance and          behavior For example in this study the respondent is          asked if the practitioners have an improved ability to          consult professional literature online A direct          measurement method would determine the number of online          literature consultations before and after the software          installation                            Conclusions        The results of this research describe the software        selection process as it occurs in physician practices        Using a telephone interview survey gave the researcher and        other interviewers direct contact with the decision makers        in each practice The results of this study also describe        how software is perceived to affect several practice        activities        The objective of this study was to identify        relationships if any between the IT selection process and        the office staffs perceptions of the ITs impact on        practice activities The results of the multiple logistic        regression models confirmed relationships between the        selection process and the perceived impacts related to the        scheduling and financial analysis activities The results        of this study demonstrated a relationship not cause and        effect between the selection process and the user        perception of software usefulness        Although many of the relationships were expected eg        performing software comparisons interviewing prior users        and selecting certain software features improved        perceptions about practice activities perhaps one of the        most important predictors of improvement was reducing the        workload during implementation Despite the importance of        this predictor only  of the practices performed this        step in this study If more practices had performed this        step it might have carried even more weight in the        analysis From a practical standpoint many of the offices        selected and implemented IT but expected the staff to learn        the software while caring for a full load of patients        Investigators from a previous study by Ambroso et al           cite this expectation as a common reason for IT        failure        One of the secondary findings of this research is that        the purchasers of the software often office managers had        perceptions about the softwares use similar to those of        users who were not involved in the selection process        This finding supports the use of a singlesurveyresponse        study design for understanding perceived impacts related to        softwares impacts on businessrelated practice        activities                    List of Abbreviations        EMR Electronic Medical Record        IT Information Technology
