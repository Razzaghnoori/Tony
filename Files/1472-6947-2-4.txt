 Background Health care providers compete for managed care contracts based on cost effectiveness and quality of care 1 2 3 4 Information technology IT provides a cost effective way to document productivity performance measures cost and quality of care Since IT has dropped in cost over time physician practices are now turning to it to meet these needs Information technology for this study is defined as computer software used to store transport or communicate information 2 5 6 7 The health care organizations that succeed in the 21 stcentury will be those that improve quality and reduce cost These juxtaposed objectives most likely will be reached through improved handling of information 2 8 9 The Committee on Quality of Health Care in America reported that most clinical information remains in paper form 9 This committee made several recommendations for improving quality including moving clinical information to an electronic format by the end of the decade Information technology selection in health care has often been performed in a rather informal way resulting in the purchase of white elephants 10 The systems may not perform as planned and may cause additional work for medical staff The systems are often purchased or developed in pieces without consideration to the overall business strategy 1 To date few publications have documented the selection process and the resulting impact of the IT on the health care organization Most papers give anecdotal descriptions often by vendors but lack client perceptions of the information system s value 1 2 7 11 12 13 14 Even at the hospital level only a few client perceptions of IT adoption have been reported 15 16 17 18 19 The number of available papers that examine IT selections within physician practices is even smaller than those papers addressing hospital selections 3 20 However many physicians are transitioning from paper to electronic formats for billing records medical charts etc This study aims to understand the process for selecting IT for physicians practices and the perceptions of the IT after it is implemented The primary objective of this research was to identify the relationship if any between the IT selection process and the office staff s perceptions of the it s impact on practice activities Methods Sample Providence Health System in Portland Oregon provided a database of practices n 933 for this study These practices all served Providence Health System in some capacity e g as primary care physicians or specialists Eligible practices had acquired software within the past five years but not within the past six months Practices with software older than five years were disqualified because it was unlikely that the decision makers if present would recall the details of the selection process Practices with software selected within the last six months were dropped because new software often requires a learning time period The original sample of 933 contained 70 practices that had no computers and 35 that had software purchased only in past six months or more than five years ago In total 11 1 of the original sample were excluded Of the remaining eligible practices n 828 407 completed the telephone survey representing a response rate of 49 2 If a qualified respondent at a practice was not reached after at least three attempts n 269 or the respondents declined the interview n 152 the practice was counted as a nonrespondent Qualified respondents were involved with software selection or software customization for the practice Seven practices gave partial interviews and were also counted as nonrespondents These respondents had to leave in the middle of the interview to address urgent clinic needs Although these respondents were rescheduled they were not reached to complete the interviews Additionally one respondent gave many don t know responses The interviewer wrote in the comment section for this office that the respondent was not qualified for the study and should be dropped Thus in total seven partial interviews and one unqualified interview were dropped from the sample reducing the total number of offices in the study to 399 The respondents and participating practices are summarized in Table 1 Second interviews were gathered for 189 of the 407 responding practices Since almost half of the responding offices represented single practitioners many of these smaller offices had only one eligible participant Telephone survey The survey questions were developed based on the literature review and discussions with an expert panel Since many of the respondents were not familiar with technical IT terms care was taken to present the survey in a respondent friendly format Thirteen college student interviewers and two supervisors conducted the interviews using a telephone interviewing software package Computer Assisted Survey Execution System A program was written to provide the interviewers with precise dialogue questions and precoded responses As the interview progressed the interviewer entered the responses into a personal computer Since the study objective included capturing the perceived impacts of IT we attempted to record perceptions from two representatives from each practice the decision maker and a primary user see Additional File 1 Physician Practice Software Telephone Survey Dialog and Questions The initial interview that included questions related to the selection process and perceived impacts of the IT lasted approximately 15 25 minutes The respondent was asked to describe a recent IT purchase at least six months old For each practice the respondent indicated whether a person in a specific role e g an administrator was involved or not involved in selection and involved or not involved in software customization Customization in this study referred to providing input to the software vendor for writing software specific to the practice During the interview we read the respondents a list of selection steps For each step the respondent answered yes or no as to whether it was performed During the interview the respondents were read several potential factors that might have influenced the purchase For each one they rated the statement on a 1 to 6 scale of importance ranging from no importance to very high importance Finally we asked the respondents to react to 12 statements describing potential impacts of the IT on selected practice activities The statements were intentionally not grouped by any particular theme The respondents rated each impact statement on a 1 to 5 scale of agreement strongly disagree slightly disagree neither agree or disagree slightly agree strongly agree or selected not applicable The second interview with a primary user of the software included mainly the perceived impact questions and lasted 7 10 minutes At the completion of the initial interview each respondent was offered a summary of the results Additional file 1

descriptively evaluated primarily by computing frequencies of responses for each question Factor analysis principal components revealed four latent factors related to the respondent s perceived impacts of the IT on four practice activities scheduling financial analysis communication and medical documentation 2 Therefore four subscales were created The scheduling financial analysis communication subscales each included two items and the medical documentation subscale included three items Responses of not applicable were coded as missing For each subscale the mean of the items was computed Diagnostic plots of the four practice activity subscales suggested that an explanatory model might be best approached using logistic regression which relaxes the assumption of normality The four subscales were recoded to dichotomous variables corresponding to agree or not agree If the mean score of 2 3 impact statements for a practice activity was greater than 3 0 the respondent was scored as 1 for agree If the mean score for a practice activity was 3 0 neither agree or disagree or less the respondent was scored as 0 for not agree Each of the four practice activity subscales became the dependent variable in a predictive model The independent variables entered into the models included the demographic and selection variables Multiple logistic regression We attempted four predictive models one for each of the newly created dichotomous subscales Only respondents who found the impact statements relevant were included in the predictive models Multiple logistic regression revealed relationships between the selection process and the perceptions related to the scheduling financial analysis and communication processes Variables that achieved a significance level of p 05 were retained in the models For the perceptions related to medical documentation no significant selection variables survived the analysis This was most likely due to the small number of practices with electronic medical records n 89 and aggregating all types of electronic medical record EMRs regardless of type and number of functions It is also possible that the decision to purchase an EMR is often made outside the practice e g a large health system offers EMRs to the practices For 11 of the 89 practices that had EMRs the decision was made by a large health system Data from these practices were not included in the predictive models thus reducing the number of available practices with EMRs to 78 A summary of the models is presented in this paper The complete analysis and models are available elsewhere 2 The predictive models were built using a model building data set 299 randomly selected interviews The models were then tested with a testing data set the remaining 100 interviews One hundred interviews were needed to insure adequate statistical power As a check for cross validation the accuracy with which the models predicted the perceived impact subscale values using the model building data set was compared to the accuracy achieved with the testing data set Using the parameters established with the model building data set agreement or not agreement to a perceived impact subscale was predicted for the testing data set For cross validation the accuracy levels were compared using a z test for proportions As seen in Table 2 the scheduling and financial analysis models had non significant p 05 drops in accuracy This suggests that the models may be generalized to other physician offices with similar demographics Since the accuracy level dropped dramatically for the communication model this model did not cross validate The observations made in this study accurately describe the idiosyncrasies of this sample used to build the communication model but may not accurately describe other samples of physician offices Once the results were completed the expert panel was reconvened to provide insight in interpreting the results In the sections that follow the descriptive results comparison of the decision maker vs user and each cross validated model are summarized and discussed Results and Discussion Comparison of decision maker vs user The primary respondents agreed with users on their perceptions of the software s impact on scheduling and financial analysis activities p 001 For the scheduling model Phi was 359 with a maximal Phi of 778 For the financial analysis model Phi was 418 with a maximal Phi of 920 Since the primary respondent was reasonably knowledgeable about the perceived impacts of the software we did not include the user data in the remainder of the cross validated models The user provided only a few demographics and the perceived impact data while the primary respondent provided the selection data as well as the perceived impact data Predicting the impact of the software on scheduling activities For the scheduling model five selection variables as a group predicted with 73 accuracy the subscale of whether the respondents on average would agree with the following two impact statements The software has improved the scheduling of patients for routine preventive and urgent appointments The software has improved the referral process in sending and receiving referrals quickly The statistically significant p 05 predictors are presented in Table 6along with the expected response by the respondent and the results of the multiple logistic regression analysis The second column of the table contains the coefficient or weighting value of B The Wald statistic Bj standard error gives a measure of significance of B for the predictor variable Looking at the odds ratios in Table 6 the likelihood of agreement with the scheduling subscale is almost four times odds ratio OR 3 89 as great when practices selected EMR packages than if they did not select EMR packages At first this finding was surprising Many EMRs however have automatic recall features when the patient should be called or sent a reminder for a health check Similarly the likelihood of agreement was almost four times OR 3 88 as great when the practice compared the software options with the best in the field than if it did not perform this step The practices that selected practice management software were 1 70 times more likely to agree that the software had improved the scheduling and referring of patients than practices that selected other types of software This finding was expected since these packages typically include a scheduling module Additionally practices that considered prior user testimony important in the selection process were 1 39 times more likely to agree with the scheduling subscale than those practices that did not consider prior user testimony as an important influence Finally a respondent who had personally selected the software was less likely to agree with the impact statements OR 0 20 The members of the expert panel felt this was a symptom of unmet expectations The members of the selection team knew how the software was supposed to perform and were likely disappointed when it didn t live up to the vendor promises These respondents had also probably seen the Cadillac performers and realized that their software had only achieved Chevrolet status Another explanation is that these practices failed to fully implement the software or to adapt clinic workflows to fully utilize the software In summary practices that selected EMR or practice management software that made software comparisons or that considered prior user testimony as important were more likely to have perceived improvements in the scheduling process than were other practices Predicting the impact of the software on financial analysis activities For the financial analysis model five selection variables as a group predicted with 86 accuracy the subscale of whether the respondents on average would agree with the following two impact statements The software has created a more accurate and timely billing process The software has improved the practice s ability to track and analyze costs and revenues associated with managed care contracts The most dramatic increase in odds of agreement OR 8 2 occurred when the practice reduced the workload to allow time to learn the software Table 7 However only 36 of the 399 practices reported that reduced workloads were provided during the implementation phase According to the survey conducted by Ambosa et al 21 expecting medical staff to learn new software while caring for a full load of patients is a common reason for failure The odds of agreement were increased by more than a factor of four OR 4 59 for each increase in managed care activities the software contained Since most managed care software packages are marketed to assist the practice in documenting costs associated with managed care contracts this finding was expected Practices that considered value an important consideration were twice OR 2 0 as likely to agree with the financial analysis subscale By contrast practices that considered compatibility an important influence were less likely OR 0 66 to agree with financial analysis subscale At first the compatibility result was surprising However 51 of these practices were first time buyers and usually buying billing software so compatibility was not a critical consideration Ninety one percent of first time buyers who rated compatibility as low to no importance agreed with the financial analysis subscale It is also possible that practices with existing good financial analysis processes and little room to improve rated compatibility as important but disagreed that the new software had improved the existing good process The finding that less expensive packages related to more satisfied buyers was interesting OR 0 25 There were many good financial packages available for less than 10 000 in 1996 Practices that spent less than 10 000 bought software packages with few but very functional features Those practices that spent more than 10 000 were purchasing complex systems perhaps for multiple sites Financial analysis may just have been a small module of these multi purpose packages In summary practices that considered value important that did not consider compatibility important that selected managed care software that spent less than 10 000 or that provided learning time during implementation were more likely to perceive that the software had improved the financial analysis process than were other practices Observations from both models In looking over the predictors for the two cross validated models scheduling and financial analysis some predictors naturally belong in one model or the other e g practice management software in the scheduling model and managed care software in the financial analysis model The themes in the scheduling model center around software features emr and practice management software comparison of software options and usability prior user testimony and personal selection by respondent The themes in the financial analysis model include cost software cost value software features managed care software and compatibility and learning time This might suggest that the respondents for the financial analysis model had differing roles in the practice than the respondents for the scheduling model In both of these models 79 of the respondents were administrators Since all types of administrators e g office managers finance managers were grouped together it was impossible to identify the primary role of administrator who responded The differences in the models also suggest that the predictors of success differ by the types of activities the software is intended to perform It might appear odd that some predictors e g learning time did not carry through to both models It is likely that the type and complexity of software package contributed to the learning demands on the office Many of the respondents who agreed with the financial analysis subscale chose managed care software that bundled together many activities tracking incoming and outgoing referrals patient enrollment capitation accounting and or utilization reporting For practices learning this type of software protected learning time was an important predictor of success For practices implementing practice management software scheduling billing and or accounting spreadsheets the learning demand was less This naturally suggests that the decision to reduce the workload while learning a software package should consider the number and complexity of the tasks to be learned Limitations and research opportunities The respondents for this study primarily represented practices that serve Providence Health System in Oregon These practices served either as managed care providers or as fee for service providers The only practices excluded were pure HMO providers e g Kaiser Permanente The pure HMO practices were excluded because it was unclear whom to interview regarding software selections Often these practices are given software directly from the organization Eighty seven percent of these practices in this study had 10 practitioners or less Only 17 of these practices had in house computer specialists assisting with software selection The results of this study may not generalize to large practices that often have in house computer specialists assisting with selection A future study could include a nationwide survey of all types of physician practices regardless of managed care status ownership specialty or size This study is retrospective in nature requiring the respondents to recall a software purchase that occurred several months perhaps more than a year earlier In an ideal study design a questionnaire should be distributed to practices that have recently made selections Another questionnaire addressing the impact on the practice could be sent at a pre defined follow up period e g six months after implementation This ideal study design would be difficult to conduct without a sufficient list of practices that have recently purchased software Perhaps software manufacturers and vendors could provide lists of recent clients with permission to interested researchers The cross sectional survey design of this study captured the technical aspects of the selection process e g who was involved what steps that were taken Although the respondents were given a few open ended questions most provided little additional information There could have been additional selection steps influences and impacts It is also possible that the observed changes in impact were related to variables we didn t attempt to measure e g ability and desire of management to implement new technologies and to change existing practice activities Focus groups might be more effective at capturing underlying management expertise Another very time invasive approach would be to conduct a series of case studies documenting the decision making process over time This research would need support from practices for observers to remain on site during the selection process This format would also promote a more well rounded multiple perspectives evaluation The current study relies on perceptive responses primarily from office managers to measure many variables including impact variables Their perceptions were related to business related practice activities Only 5 3 of the respondents were clinicians It is likely that expanding this study to include more clinician responses would reveal perceptions related to other processes e g medical documentation or treatment processes The subscales related to practice activities were formed from responses to only two to three original impact questions A stronger design of these practice activities impacts would include several questions related to each activity Given the exploratory nature of this current research this limitation could not have been foreseen However the results of this study open doors for more confirmatory types of studies to design survey instruments that measure software impact with underlying practice activity constructs This study does not attempt to demonstrate cause and effect It would be important to have respondents rate existing practice activities before purchasing software to control for a ceiling effect practices with existing good processes have little room to improve If such a trial were designed it would also need to control for the type of IT and the needs of the buyer To move toward a more direct measure of impact would require the practices to closely measure performance and behavior For example in this study the respondent is asked if the practitioners have an improved ability to consult professional literature online A direct measurement method would determine the number of online literature consultations before and after the software installation Conclusions The results of this research describe the software selection process as it occurs in physician practices Using a telephone interview survey gave the researcher and other interviewers direct contact with the decision makers in each practice The results of this study also describe how software is perceived to affect several practice activities The objective of this study was to identify relationships if any between the IT selection process and the office staff s perceptions of the IT s impact on practice activities The results of the multiple logistic regression models confirmed relationships between the selection process and the perceived impacts related to the scheduling and financial analysis activities The results of this study demonstrated a relationship not cause and effect between the selection process and the user perception of software usefulness Although many of the relationships were expected e g performing software comparisons interviewing prior users and selecting certain software features improved perceptions about practice activities perhaps one of the most important predictors of improvement was reducing the workload during implementation Despite the importance of this predictor only 36 of the practices performed this step in this study If more practices had performed this step it might have carried even more weight in the analysis From a practical standpoint many of the offices selected and implemented IT but expected the staff to learn the software while caring for a full load of patients Investigators from a previous study by Ambroso et al 21 cite this expectation as a common reason for IT failure One of the secondary findings of this research is that the purchasers of the software often office managers had perceptions about the software s use similar to those of users who were not involved in the selection process This finding supports the use of a single survey response study design for understanding perceived impacts related to software s impacts on business related practice activities List of Abbreviations EMR Electronic Medical Record IT Information Technology OR Odds Ratio Competing Interests None Declared Author comments on prior presentation
