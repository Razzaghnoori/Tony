 Background The tumor suppressor gene PTEN also called MMAC1 has been found deleted or mutated in a great variety of human tumors and tumor cell lines 1 2 3 and its tumor suppressing function has been confirmed in several in vitro studies 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Mice which are homozygously deficient in wild type PTEN die during embryonic development and harbor regions of increased cellular proliferation whereas heterozygous mice are viable but spontaneously develop tumors of various origins 11 12 PTEN has been shown to exhibit dual specificity protein phosphatase activity as well as lipid phosphatase activity in vitro 13 14 15 16 17 18 These enzymatic functions appear to be involved in the regulation of at least two separate signal transduction pathways First PTEN s protein phosphatase activity is able to down regulate focal adhesion kinase FAK phosphorylation which leads to the inactivation of the Ras MAP kinase pathway 19 20 21 Second its lipid phosphatase activity targets the second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3 4 5 trisphosphate PtdIns 3 4 5 P 3 and thereby blocks activation of the protein kinase B PKB Akt pathway 11 18 22 23 24 Whereas both of the above pathways are intimately involved in the control of cell growth and survival PTEN regulated FAK activity further appears to impinge on cell adhesion cell migration and cell invasion 20 21 It therefore emerges that the loss of PTEN activity may confer increased survival ability proliferative potential and invasive capacity on cells and thereby may promote progression towards a more malignant phenotype A characteristic phenotype of tumorigenic cells is their ability to grow anchorage independently in suspension culture or embedded in soft agar without the need for attachment to the surface of a cell culture dish 25 26 A flurry of papers has established a close link between anchorage independent growth and the activity of several components of the cell cycle machinery such as various cyclins cyclin dependent kinases CDKs and the CDK inhibitors p21 Cip1and p27 Kip1 27 28 29 30 31 32 There are indications that PTEN may be involved in these processes as well For example mouse embryonal stem ES cells with homozygous deletion of the PTEN gene exhibit increased anchorage independent growth as compared to normal ES cells 12 Similarly transfer of a wild type PTEN gene into anchorage independent human glioblastoma cells which lack functional PTEN results in their greatly reduced ability to form colonies in soft agar 4 5 6 The interpretation of these latter findings however is complicated by the strong anti proliferative effects of PTEN even in monolayer culture which is consistently observed when the wild type version of this gene is introduced into PTEN negative tumor cells 4 6 7 8 9 10 18 33 Moreover in human glioma and breast cancer cell lines the ectopic expression of wild type PTEN leads to anoikis which is apoptosis initiated by the disruption of cell matrix interactions 23 34 35 36 Because essentially all of these previous studies have analyzed PTEN function by introducing the cloned version of the gene back into PTEN deficient cells essentially nothing is known about the regulation of the endogenous PTEN gene in response to alterations of cell matrix interactions For example it is unclear whether PTEN is constitutively active or becomes activated in response to changes in the cellular microenvironment Here we present our findings that in normal anchorage dependent fibroblast cells the expression and activity of endogenous PTEN is increased when cellular adhesion to matrix is disrupted In parallel phosphorylation of FAK a known target of PTEN is greatly reduced In view of PTEN s potent growth inhibitory capacity we conclude from our study that the increased expression and activity of endogenous PTEN in response to the disruption of cell matrix interactions contributes to the maintenance of the anchorage dependent phenotype of normal cells Results A model to study cell regulatory events during anchorage independent growth is the culture of cells in suspension i e on HEMA coated plates that prevent cells from attachment to the matrix of the cell culture dish 37 Several studies have employed this approach and characterized the regulation of various cell cycle regulatory proteins after the transfer of cells to such suspension culture 27 28 29 30 31 32 Here we have used this model to analyze the potential involvement of the tumor suppressor PTEN The murine cell line 10T1 2 and the human cell line MDAH both of which are anchorage dependent fibroblasts were detached from their tissue culture dishes and cultured further on HEMA coated plates As shown in Figure 1 this transfer to suspension culture resulted in elevated expression of PTEN protein in each cell line This increase was apparent within the first four hours and continued for several more hours In parallel the expression of cyclin A an essential component of certain cyclin dependent kinases and absolutely required for the progression of cells through the cell cycle 38 39 was down regulated under these conditions Figure 1 consistent with earlier observations 27 28 31 Furthermore expression of the CDK inhibitor p27 Kip1was strongly increased in suspension cells Figure 1 similar to what has been observed in other cell types after the disruption of cell matrix interactions 29 31 32 Finally as we have reported before 31 the expression of cdk4 one of the catalytic subunits of CDKs was not significantly altered in suspension culture cells and therefore could be used as a loading control for the Western blot analysis As expected in the case of anchorage dependent cells the activity of cyclin dependent kinases was strongly reduced and cell proliferation was inhibited under these suspension culture conditions not shown To analyze whether the observed induction of PTEN protein was due to elevated expression of its mRNA Northern blot analysis was performed In this case increased expression was found as well Figure 2 In MDAH cells in particular the increase in PTEN mRNA closely correlated with the observed increase in PTEN protein and encompassed both major mRNA species of 2 5 and 5 0 kb In the mouse cells only the shorter mRNA species appeared to be induced In order to determine the relative increase in PTEN mRNA levels the Northern blots were stripped and re hybridized with control probes for actin and choA the latter a highly abundant mRNA of unknown function 40 We consistently found that the amount of actin mRNA was somewhat reduced during suspension culture whereas the amount of choA remained relatively stable We therefore used choA as the loading control and calculated the increase in PTEN mRNA with reference to choA Using this approach we determined that PTEN mRNA was increased up to 5 fold in MDAH cells and 4 fold in 10T1 2 cells This induction was comparable to the increase observed in Western blot analysis and therefore indicated that the levels of PTEN protein were elevated due to the increased expression of PTEN mRNA Although clearly induced in both cell lines the kinetics of PTEN induction in 10T1 2 and MDAH cells were somewhat different at later time points i e there was a slight reduction of PTEN mRNA and protein in MDAH cells at 36 hours possibly indicating some cell type specific differences By using nuclear run off analysis we further determined that the induction of PTEN was regulated at the transcriptional level i e the transcription of the PTEN gene was significantly higher in cells that were transferred to suspension culture conditions Figure 3 We next analyzed whether the elevated quantity of PTEN protein would indeed be reflected in increased phosphatase activity in suspension culture cells In order to establish whether PTEN protein phosphatase activity could be reliably measured in vitro we first transfected PTEN negative U87 cells with an expression vector harboring PTEN cDNA As a control the cells were also transfected with empty vector Then PTEN was immunoprecipitated from the respective cellular lysates and the antigen antibody complex was analyzed for protein phosphatase activity As shown in Figure 4A only cells transfected with PTEN cDNA exhibited significant enzymatic activity Non transfected U87 cells or cells transfected with vector alone did not exhibit protein phosphatase activity above background levels After having established that PTEN protein phosphatase activity could be determined specifically we transferred MDAH cells to suspension culture conditions and measured PTEN activity at various times afterwards As shown in Figure 4B there was an increase in PTEN activity that could be detected as early as four hours after detachment and reached its maximum at around 12 hours It is noticeable that the activity at the onset of the experiment 0 hours cells attached to tissue culture plates was higher than background which likely indicates some basal activity of PTEN in attached cells This basal level activity was not detectable in PTEN negative U87 cells compare Figure 4A Focal adhesion kinase FAK is a known substrate for PTEN and has been shown to be dephosphorylated by this phosphatase in vitro and in vivo 20 21 34 We therefore determined whether the increased PTEN phosphatase activity would correlate with decreased phosphorylation of FAK in our cells This was indeed the case As shown in Figure 5 the detachment of MDAH cells from their matrix resulted in decreased tyrosine specific phosphorylation of FAK The overall amount of FAK protein in these cells did not change under these conditions indicating that the loss of tyrosine phosphorylation was not caused by reduced amounts of protein In light of a recent report establishing the tumor suppressor p53 as a transcriptional activator of PTEN expression 41 we investigated whether this protein would affect the observed induction of PTEN in our cell system As MDAH cells themselves are p53 negative we used MDAH cells stably transfected with a tetracycline regulated p53 gene called TR9 7 42 These TR9 7 cells were pre treated with or without tetracycline in monolayer culture After the induction of p53 was maximal the cells were transferred to suspension culture conditions and analyzed for their expression of PTEN As shown in Figure 6 the degree of PTEN induction was essentially the same in the absence or presence of p53 indicating that p53 did not affect the induction of PTEN protein under these conditions In parallel MDAH cells were also treated with tetracycline and transferred to suspension culture In this case as well tetracycline treatment had no effect on the induction of PTEN confirming that tetracycline by itself did not affect PTEN expression Figure 6 In conclusion MDAH cells p53 negative 10T1 2 cells p53 positive and TR9 7 cells high or low levels of p53 all exhibited similarly increased expression levels of PTEN in response to the disruption of cell matrix interactions Therefore we conclude that the observed induction of PTEN occurs independent of p53 Discussion In light of the close correlation between the anchorage independent phenotype and the tumorigenicity of transformed cells it is important to fully understand the cellular mechanisms that are involved in cell growth arrest after the disruption of cell matrix interactions Many previous studies in this area have focused on the contribution of various components of the cell cycle machinery Collectively they have established that the expression of cyclin A and cyclin D in combination with the activity of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p21 Cip1and p27 Kip1 is a crucial determinant of anchorage dependent cell growth culture 27 28 29 30 31 32 However while the above elements clearly are essential executioners of cell cycle progression it is conceivable that other elements directly or indirectly might be involved in anchorage dependent growth control as well In this regard a report from our laboratory has indicated a role for the serine threonine specific protein phosphatase type 2A PP2A 43 In this current study we investigated the response of the PTEN tumor suppressor to changes in cell matrix interactions of anchorage dependent human and mouse fibroblast cells Previous studies by others had shown that the ectopic expression of PTEN in anchorage independent tumor cells greatly reduced their ability to grow in soft agar 4 5 6 In this latter situation however the forced expression of ectopic PTEN effectively impairs cellular proliferation in general even under two dimensional culture conditions where the cells are attached to substratum 4 6 7 8 9 10 18 33 44 It was therefore difficult to discern from these experiments how effectively and selectively PTEN participates in anchorage dependent growth control As an alternative to the forced expression of ectopic PTEN in anchorage independent PTEN negative tumor cells our study has focused on the regulation of endogenous PTEN in anchorage dependent mouse and human fibroblasts We found that upon detachment both cell lines exhibited increased levels of PTEN expression due to the transcriptional activation of the PTEN gene The increased levels of PTEN protein resulted in strongly increased intracellular PTEN phosphatase activity Thus our results revealed a close correlation between the disruption of cell matrix interactions and the subsequent activation of the PTEN phosphatase In light of the well established growth inhibitory effects exerted by increased levels of this phosphatase it is reasonable to conclude that this activation of PTEN significantly contributes to the anchorage dependent phenotype i e to the inhibition of cell proliferation after detachment from matrix It should be noted that the fibroblast cells lines we used remain fully viable after detachment and transfer to suspension culture 31 43 This is in contrast to most epithelial cells which undergo anoikis i e apoptotic cell death after the disruption of cell matrix interactions 45 It is of interest that some anchorage independent tumor cells most of which are of epitheloid origin become susceptible to anoikis after the introduction of exogenous PTEN 23 34 35 36 These observations are in line with the established ability of PTEN to down regulate the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase PI3 K PKB survival pathway 11 46 The absence of anoikis in our two cell lines may reflect inherent cell type specific differences i e the superior ability of fibroblasts to survive under suspension culture conditions One could speculate that increased levels of PTEN might favor growth arrest in fibroblasts versus apoptosis in epitheloid cells Furthermore it appears that the specific experimental or physiological conditions of cellular attachment or detachment might influence the precise function of PTEN in these processes For example it was shown recently that the reduction of PTEN expression levels by antisense oligonucleotides in a colon carcinoma cell line generated differential effects on cell adhesion depending on whether the cells were kept under static or hydrodynamic conditions of fluid flow 47 One of the established in vivo substrates of PTEN FAK is known to play a major role in growth regulatory signal transduction initiated by cell surface integrin receptors 48 49 As we observe a correlation between increased PTEN activity and decreased levels of FAK phosphorylation compare Figure 4Band Figure 5 it is likely that the dephosphorylation of FAK in response to the disruption of cell matrix interactions is accomplished by increased PTEN activity Such a scenario would plausibly explain some of PTEN s growth inhibitory effect Additional growth inhibitory effects of increased PTEN activity are likely to occur through the stimulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 Kip1 This protein acts as inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinases the cell cycle engine 50 and its elevated expression has been consistently demonstrated in different cell types after the disruption of cell matrix interactions compare Figure 1and 31 32 51 52 Furthermore p27 Kip1is an established target of PTEN signaling i e its activity has been found increased after the forced expression of exogenous PTEN 53 54 55 56 In combination with the data presented in this manuscript it therefore appears that PTEN contributes to anchorage dependent growth control by a two fold approach the dephosphorylation of the signaling molecule FAK in combination with the stimulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 Kip1 Conclusions In view of PTEN s potent growth inhibitory capacity we conclude that its induction after cell matrix disruptions contributes to the maintenance of the anchorage dependent phenotype of normal cells The underlying processes involve the stimulation of expression of p27 Kip1and the dephosphorylation of FAK Materials and Methods Materials HEMA poly HEMA poly 2
