 okay do you have you noticed any new um trends in politics well the one i think is interesting is the California Los Angeles police chief who says he wants to resign and did you hear yesterday that Mayor Bradley said that uh he should oh really no i didn t hear that think it i think what s interesting is that uh uh the political activists Jesse Jackson and a lot of other people went out there and are demonstrating i find it interesting that uh outsiders would bother to go in how do how do you feel about people like Jesse Jackson getting involved um i think sometimes it s good for people outside they get a different perspective uh perspective on an issue and stuff so yeah i don t see any problem with outsiders going in and getting a little bit involved i think though that it should still be uh sort of up to the majority in the area i don t know on something like that they wouldn t really vote on it or anything though what do you think Gates should resign probably so just because they were under his authority and he obviously failed somewhere along the line well well speaking of that kind of issue have you kept up with John Wiley Price yeah what do you think of him oh um i think he s got good intentions but i m not sure if the way he goes about what he does is really right he s an interesting person i was talking to someone who said that uh for all his obvious uh attention to efforts to get media attention that he actually is a worker on the uh i guess he s on the County uh oh Board of Supervisors or i think and that that that uh at those meetings he really comes quite well prepared and is well informed and is a hard worker right uh huh and is really quite agreeable uh uh and that the stuff we see in the you know in the media is uh well he s really just trying to make a political statement i i find that an interesting element of politics that we don t that that most people would not know that John Wiley Price apparently is a is a you know course he s got in this this deal over racism and uh you know name calling and all this but apparently he s a a worker uh you may disagree with him but i i i find this whole what do you think of this uh fourteen one and ten four one in Dallas oh i think that they should go ahead and go to the uh fourteen one i to me it s just fair you know and equal it seem like every area should have an equal voice i agree with you but did you see the map they drew up on uh on how they were gonna divide up the districts no it was it was the strangest i m i m not sure it was gerrymandered but the way they drew these little patterns and stuff i i i guess i m a little cynical of the of the power base i i i and i don t quite understand why the power base uh doesn t uh why they don t go with fourteen one i you know i and you know the it seems to me that what happened in the in the election that a lot of the people they said particularly the the uh i think it s Hispanics don t vote because they don t think that they have any affect and it s i i guess i am disappointed with Dallas in that uh the fourteen one it yeah i don t know you can you can disagree with Al Lipscomb and uh what s what s the lady s name Diane Ragsdale yeah you can disagree with uh what they re doing and what they re saying but in reality i think they re they re trying to represent their constituents yeah and i think Dallas is doing itself a disservice i think they ought to get on with something important yeah they really make themselves look bad and i don t know why certain groups are fighting so hard to keep the ten four one yeah and i but i think even i even those people are it s like Pauken and Box and these people i think it s i find it interesting that everybody s so busy politicking that the question is did we get anything good done it s like this whole school issue are are you involved in the schools at all public school no huh uh this whole thing down there where they re they re trying to um uh you know devote all our money and raise our taxes and better schools and and it all seems you know everybody s trying to one upmanship on everybody else so yeah yeah it i i have got to run to a meeting it s good talking to you i don t think we ve gone our our ten minutes but i think we ve we ve talked long enough so okay was okay good talking to you bye okay good night
