 you uh uh we are latecomers my husband and i to the world of golf we started when we were both oh i would imagine he was fifty years old so we ve not been at the game that long but we love it oh well good so you re a player then instead of a spectator then uh probably i am a player but certainly not a good player uh the highlight of my season is probably the four times i get under a hundred oh right so boy you re you re you re right up there about where i am then oh i see gosh i thought young people were all good on no young people like to swing real hard at the ball uh huh so you find yourself you find yourself in the rough a lot they just hit a long way well i m i m getting better about hitting them straight but where i get into trouble is around the green oh my my short game leaves a lot to be desired well we we speak of the three games of golf here oh and that would be the long the short and the putt of it yes so the short of it is my weakest part uh huh we uh often times have made a trip to Mississippi in March because of course it s still cold here in March and we always hope for warm weather down there and the people that we play with uh the men foursome are all much longer ball hitters than my husband is but he finds that by going straight down the middle he usually wins about a quarter a hole because they ve been in the rough on the right and then in the rough on the left so he ends up playing just as well as they do yeah i i ve you know i see that all the time as a matter of fact i live uh literally right across the street from a golf course here in Texas uh huh and uh most of the older folks that go out there and play are exactly the same way all of us young bucks get out there and hit the ball you know a mile but it s like three fairways over yes our golf course in this small town is a beautiful course with a creek running through it so we have some water hazards and we have some sand and we have some hills um for the most part we all use carts uh battery operated carts and and most of us own our own carts uh huh my husband happens to be on the board for the first time this year which is a new experience for him uh our membership is very inexpensive um oh boy yeah probably total cost with monthly minimum and cart storage and membership would make it about a thousand dollars a year well you can get a walking membership for two hundred dollars a year at the course down here yeah oh can you really that amazes me yeah it s an eighteen hole course i mean it s it s uh not terribly difficult and there s really there s a a river that runs along the side but it only comes into play on one par three hole uh huh there s really not that many hazards on it but uh it s a really inexpensive course to get on i m always amazed that uh larger areas uh they can play for what we can uh many of our friends who are transferred away from for some reason or another end up in cities that it would cost them ten thousand dollars a year to belong to a club which yeah there s a few of those here too right so do you play much no not near as much as i d like to i mean i ve i tend to stay pretty busy at my job and uh uh huh yeah and it s hard to get on a regular schedule and then we re pretty active in our church which takes up a lot more time too so um hum um hum and you probably have children at home which takes up a lot more time but no we actually don t oh i see we have we have two miniature dachshunds and ten fish oh my well we re down to two cats and they don t take a whole lot of time either but we find that each fall when the season seems to be shut down here we say next year we re going to play more golf uh huh uh this is the second summer that my husband s been retired and he did play more last year of course but we were gone a lot too uh yeah and that makes although we ve played golf a lot of places around the United States uh on different trips but it s even though we started late it s certainly become a very prime part of our life in the summer time where have you have you played any in Texas never have in fact we just drove through Texas uh in mid February or late February i guess and we hoped to play while we were there we stayed overnight in a little town called Eastland Texas and wanted to play hoped to play there the next morning but it was like thirty nine degrees the next morning and very windy so we just went on to El Paso yeah it does basically though the the golf season only shuts down for maybe three months out of the year if that much you know probably not even that much because really uh huh uh February and January were about the only two really cold months that we had it was up in the very warm temperatures even in December this year uh huh uh huh that would be wonderful to be able to play and of course from our town a lot of people go to Arizona or Florida for the winter and they re able to play all year round but sure yeah oh Arizona s beautiful um hum yes i was amazed we spent the only time we played on our trip was in Douglas Arizona and uh that was just um it was just wonderful to be able to get out and hit a ball the course was not not green but it was going to be in another month when they started watering yeah so yes it s it s it s become a big part of our lives even though we re late players hey well hey you know it s never too late is what i say well i guess not well maybe you ll get to play more this year well i sure hope so uh well plan on it at least okay nice chatting with you and with you bye bye bye
