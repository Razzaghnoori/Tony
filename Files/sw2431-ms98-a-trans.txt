 uh no i think that maybe the the automation people that are oh okay we re discrete well are not discrete uh electronic devices oh oh and did he is he the one that got you connected with us uh huh um hum okay it s a lot of fun yeah you want to punch the button and go sure you ready yep okay well are you going to buy a car soon well it won t be too much longer because my husband and i are both going to retire retire and when we retire we re going to buy us a you know a new one and and get rid of the two that we have right now and what are you going to buy i do i don t know we re either gonna buy a pick up or we re gonna buy a van or we re gonna buy an economy car how do you like that well have you been listening to Iaccoca s arguments that uh that Chrysler products are the only ones that that all have airbags yeah does that make a difference to you yeah it sure does i really would like to have something like that and i m hoping that by you know that s like right now my husband would like for me to buy another vehicle right now but i keep saying lets put it off lets put it off because i m hoping they ll get so many better features yeah like what well just like that air bag i think that thing is fantastic cause i ve seen some of the you know like the head on collision type things where they had it yeah and people walk away from it we had one here i guess it was about three weeks ago and the people walked away from the wreck with no scratches nothing you know a few bruises that s nice did did you see the uh i don t know if it was 20 20 last Thursday or Friday night on on seat belts um hum did that scare you a little bit with the lady being thrown out uh huh you got it i and run over i tell you what i would not i would not buy a car that had the seat belt where it was hooked under the door that really scared i guess i that that a little more than scared me that irritated me uh that because it if if it it surely didn t come as a surprise that that if the door came open the lady would fall out i mean and well you know what the average person would you ever have thought of that um no probably well i m not the problem is i m i m really into cars and so it s not a uh i mean now it you probably would not um for me it s it s a real it s a real consideration um uh and and uh the but no i probably wouldn t have even though i m really quite into cars it s it s probably my main hobby right because you always think i mean i don t know maybe you don t but just like me i always think well you know these things must be safe but that s just like i don t know if you ve heard about it a few years ago they said you know before they had the like the shoulder strap thing where it was just like a seat belt that goes across your waist yeah all these people were and and it was on one of those kind of shows like 20 20 these people were like paralyzed and because it threw them forward but they were hooked at the waist and so it like you know did something to their spinal cord uh huh yeah then they were like paraplegics yeah you know Road and Track had a had some articles on and particularly with with backseat uh with some where kids were were sitting in the backseat with seat belts on and they were thrown forward into the front seat and there was enough stretching the combination of stretching the spine to uh paralyze i mean to serious injury even though they were they were still locked in the the forced to go so really if your sitting in the backseat right you re better off not to have your seatbelt on if it s just a seatbelt we have a van that uh just has seat belts in the back doesn t have a shoulder harness yeah well tell me about your van do you like it i have an Arrow Star van we really do uh it s it s a mini van we ve had it goodness in May will be five years and uh they replace the engine at sixty thousand under extended warranty and the transmission was replaced but they really are nifty um the mini van it s actually we had a station wagon before and it s a foot or two shorter than a we had a regular size station wagon um hum and it really um we like it it the interestingly enough one of the features we like are the electric locks huh the reason that we re thinking about something like that we took a trip in my brother in law and sister in laws to Florida uh huh and like i said i mean we re not that old but my husband works for the state and after a certain amount of years you can retire and when he retires i m retiring well as soon as i get my quarters in i m retiring period that s it you know no more and so uh huh yeah well but the did you did you go to Florida in a van uh huh and we wanted to travel well that was really nice traveling but you know i like to know more i mean hear about more people that have things like that you know and see what they think of them the different kinds because i ve only ridden in the one that s it yeah yeah which what kind was it uh shoot i can t even think of the name of it now what what was remarkable this van even with the we have two kids and we went to Disney World uh huh uh actually i grew up in Alabama and i went to see my mother and then went on down to Disney World and it got better than i think twenty two twenty three miles a gallon and this was with the air conditioner on and and you know yeah four people with with luggage and uh course this grant it that s you know it s been four years ago but it s remarkable that the that the bigger vans uh they re uh my boss just bought a a pick up truck and uh he only gets seventeen miles a gallon yeah but it it has a big engine and it it pulls a boat and stuff but it s and it it s got the seats that and the other thing that is interesting is it has uh rear air conditioning uh huh and that that makes a lot of difference in those of us that live in warm climates yeah well now this one that we went in it did baby what kind of van was that that we went to Florida in a what a Ford Ford what you remember he was trying to think of what the name of it was well the big you know the big vans are all real nice this was a big one i mean it was a big one it had the it had the front and the back and you know it has the uh backseat let down into a double i mean a queen size bed and then it had the two swivels in the middle and then yeah oh those are yeah yeah the two swivel chairs on the front all right and i mean it was fantastic and it got good gas mileage but they uh i don t know i don t really i don t i want something i can drive too you know and i was scared to drive that big van well well the mini the you d be surprised if if you drive a one of the the mini vans uh fact there all more or less alike the the uh Chevrolet and uh well of course Oldsmo bile has got one and Chryslers got one but they drive remarkably like cars well do you does yours have that this one had it where you know you would see something coming in the rear view mirror i mean not the rear those little side mirror things and it would look like it was further back than it was yeah yeah but the little thing etched in it say objects are are closer than they appear or something yeah does yours do that too oh i was wondering if all vans did that yeah well you you can you can uh install those mirrors we ve got the big side mirrors which are really nice i don t know if you ve well if you ve driven a pick up truck you know these are these uh mirrors are must be six inches across not nearly a foot high uh huh and they really nice uh i m on both sides actually they they fold so when you get in tight situations you can fold them back yeah well see that s the reason that we couldn t make really make them at first we were going to get a pick up truck with a camper on the back of it but then that gas mileage was just atrocious i mean it s unreal it s but there uh huh um hum uh you just practically don t get any well they have got some of the newer ones they you know with the aerodynamic features you can get pretty pretty decent gas mileage yeah and then uh he talked about a van and i said well you know i don t know i don t know how the gas is on most of these and another thing was that s the reason i said you know there was such a big difference you know in a little economy car but i said maybe we might have to get us an economy car to pull along oh uh huh when we went somewhere but really and truly the safety features but i wouldn t get one that if it had the seat belts on the door now i wouldn t get it period yeah yeah interesting enough Ford announced that i think in ninety two they re going to put uh air bags in their in their vans oh that would be good so uh and i think i i believe safety i i i i really do believe in this stuff uh and i i think it s important i m not the air bags are a good deal but um surprisingly uh they re uh you really need to do you need a combination of both the air bags and the uh oh i think so too i don t think they should do away with the seat belts now i m but i think you need the shoulder thing i think you need the thing around your waist but i think you need that bag to pop out too and your seatbelt so yeah yeah you know because i know so many people here that have been killed in head on collisions where maybe if they had they had that that air bag they may still be walking around yeah yeah but uh i think it s fantastic i wish they required it in everything every new car that came out i wish they would require it in it it would be interesting to see what that d do to our insurance rates you know if if uh if the insurance companies says it says we re not going to pay you know a claim if if the car doesn t have air bags would be interesting wouldn t it uh that wouldn t be fair but uh yeah well no because what they would do is that s what they re going to plan on you know they would have to do it the insurance company would have to do the same thing they re given like a ten year time limit yeah where okay these cars i guess they figure all the old cars will be off the roads or something by the in ten years yeah and then you know if you didn t have a car that had one in it then your insurance would go up enormously uh i ve got to go my son s in a performance tonight i have to leave in a couple of minutes uh i think we ve probably spent a reasonable amount of time oh that s okay okay it was good talking to you okay good night well you you too all right bye bye
