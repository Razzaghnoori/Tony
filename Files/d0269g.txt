 United States General Accounting Office Executive Guide GAO October 2001 STRATEGIES TO MANAGE IMPROPER PAYMENTS Learning From Public and Private Sector Organizations a GAO 02 69G Preface The federal government of the United States the largest and most complex organization in the world expended approximately 1 8 trillion dollars in fiscal year 2000 As the steward of taxpayer dollars it is accountable for how its agencies and grantees spend those funds and is responsible for safeguarding against improper payments payments that should not have been made or that were made for incorrect amounts Despite the amount of funds involved and the impact improper payments can have on a program s ability to achieve its intended outcome most agencies have not yet estimated the magnitude of improper payments in their programs Without a systematic measurement of the extent of the problem agency management cannot determine 1 if the problem is significant enough to require corrective action 2 how much to costeffectively invest in internal control systems to correct the problem or 3 the impact of the actions already taken to reduce improper payments or additional corrective actions needed This executive guide is intended to identify effective practices and provide case illustrations and other information for federal agencies consideration when developing strategies and planning and implementing actions to manage improper payments in their programs It was prepared at the request of Senator Joseph I Lieberman Chairman Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs This is one in a series of projects we are undertaking for the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Government Reform concerning the issue of improper payments involving federal programs In producing this guide we contacted a number of private and public sector organizations which we identified primarily through extensive research on financial management practices and obtained information on actions that they took and considered effective in reducing improper payments 1The participants were the Department of Health and Human Services Health Care Financing Administration 2the Social Security Administration the Department of Veterans Affairs the states of Illinois Texas and Kentucky the governments of Australia New Zealand and the United Kingdom and three private sector corporations 3We thank them for their willingness to participate and for the valuable information and insights they provided 1 For a more detailed discussion of our objectives scope and methodology see appendix I 2 In July 2001 the Health Care Financing Administration was renamed the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS 3 For a description of each of these entities see

Management and Assurance Contents Preface Introduction Observations Abbreviations Introduction Improper payments are a widespread and significant problem receiving increased attention not only in the federal government but also among states foreign governments and private sector companies Improper payments include inadvertent errors such as duplicate payments and miscalculations payments for unsupported or inadequately supported claims payments for services not rendered payments to ineligible beneficiaries and payments resulting from outright fraud and abuse by program participants and or federal employees In the federal government for example they occur in a variety of programs and activities including those related to contractors and contract management health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid financial assistance benefits such as Food Stamps and housing subsidies and tax refunds While in the private sector improper payments most often present an internal problem that threatens profitability in the public sector they can translate into serving fewer recipients or represent wasteful spending or a higher relative tax burden that prompts questions and criticism from the Congress the media and the taxpayers For federal programs with legislative or regulatory eligibility criteria improper payments indicate that agencies are spending more than necessary to meet program goals Conversely for programs with fixed funds any waste of federal funds translates into serving fewer recipients or accomplishing less programmatically than could be expected Despite a climate of increased scrutiny most improper payments associated with federal programs continue to go unidentified as they drain taxpayer resources away from the missions and goals of our government They occur for many reasons including insufficient oversight or monitoring inadequate eligibility controls and automated system deficiencies However one point is clear based on our study the basic or root causes of improper payments can typically be traced to a lack of or breakdown in internal control Collectively internal controls are an integral component of an organization s management that provides reasonable assurance that the organization achieves its objectives of 1 effective and efficient operations 2 reliable financial reporting and 3 compliance with laws and regulations Internal controls are not one event but a series of actions and activities that occur throughout an entity s operations and on an ongoing basis People make internal controls work and responsibility for good internal controls rests with all managers The risk of improper payments increases in programs with 1 complex criteria for computing payments 2 a significant volume of transactions or 3 emphasis on expediting payments Since these factors apply to a number of government programs that collectively disburse billions of dollars there is clearly a need for federal agencies to be ever more vigilant in the design implementation and maintenance of proper controls for safeguarding assets and preventing and detecting fraud and errors The risk of improper payments and the government s ability to prevent them will continue to be of concern in the future Under current federal budget policies as the baby boom generation leaves the workforce spending pressures will grow rapidly due to increased costs of programs such as Medicare Medicaid and Social Security Other federal expenditures are also likely to increase The increased size of federal programs spending pressures implementation of new programs and changes in existing programs all but guarantee that absent improvements in internal controls and other proactive actions the potential for additional or larger volumes of improper payments will be present Figure 1 illustrates the reported and projected trends in certain federal expenditures excluding interest on the public debt for fiscal years 1980 through 2006 Figure 1 Trends in Certain Actual and Projected Federal Expenditures Fiscal Years 1980 Through 2006 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 Fiscal year Other Social Security Defense Medicare Medicaid Source Actual and projected amounts are from the Budget of the United States Government Fiscal Year 2002 Historical Tables The President s Management Agenda Fiscal Year 2002 includes a governmentwide initiative for improved financial performance Under this initiative the administration will establish a baseline of the extent of erroneous payments and require agencies to include in their fiscal year 2003 budget submissions information on erroneous payment rates including actual and target rates where available for benefit and assistance programs over 2 billion Using this information the Office of Management and Budget will work with agencies to establish goals to reduce erroneous payments for each program Few would argue that the goal of reducing improper payments is not a worthy one But attacking the problem requires a strategy appropriate to the organization involved and its particular risks including a consideration of the legal requirements surrounding security and privacy issues The organizations that participated in our study have taken actions that they consider to be effective in reducing potential as well as actual improper payments All of these actions shared a common focus of improving the internal control systems over the problem area This focus on internal controls does not necessarily mean that the programs lacked controls but that the existing controls needed to be updated or policies and procedures added to strengthen the overall control system In this executive guide we highlight many of the strategic actions taken by the study participants 4to reduce improper payments We categorize these actions into the five components of internal control control environment risk assessment control activities information and communications and monitoring outlined in the Comptroller General s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government GAO AIMD 00 21 3 1 November 1999 5For purposes of this study we define these components as follows Control environment creating a culture of accountability by establishing a positive and supportive attitude toward improvement and the achievement of established program outcomes Risk assessment performing comprehensive reviews and analyses of program operations to determine if risks exist and the nature and extent of the risks identified Control activities taking actions to address identified risk areas and help ensure that management s decisions and plans are carried out and program objectives are met Information and communications using and sharing relevant reliable and timely financial and nonfinancial information in managing improper payment related activities 4 The examples we have included from these organizations are meant only to illustrate the range and variety of internal controls that may be useful to federal agency managers They are not all inclusive and may not include the specific controls that a particular agency may need 5 The Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act of 1982 required that we issue standards for internal control in the federal government Monitoring tracking improvement initiatives over time and identifying additional actions needed to further improve program efficiency and effectiveness Although these internal control components are applicable to the entirety of an organization s operations 6this executive guide focuses on internal controls as they relate to reducing improper payments The following graphic represents the interrelationship between the components and efforts to manage improper payments Figure 2 Managing Improper Payments Through Internal Controls While this guide discusses each of these control areas separately actions to manage improper payments would typically require a continual interaction between these areas As depicted in the figure the control environment surrounds and reinforces the other components but all components work in concert toward a central objective which in this case is managing improper payments We conclude our discussion of the actions taken to address improper payments with observations about key factors necessary for success We have included descriptions of the entities we visited in appendix II Also appendix III identifies other sources of information that may be useful to federal agencies in their efforts to address improper payments in their programs 6See also Internal Control Management and Evaluation Tool GAO 01 1008G August 2001 The purpose of this tool is to assist agencies in maintaining or implementing effective internal control and as needed to help determine what where and how improvements can be implemented Control Environment Instilling a Culture of Accountability Changes madein Texas might not have happened if the legislature hadn t become involved Regulations should not be seen as roadblocks but as support orbacking to achieve the agencies mission Ken Holcomb Director of Systems Resources Office of Investigations and Enforcement Texas Health and Human Services Commission Of the elements that are critical to the identification development and implementation of activities to reduce improper payments perhaps the most significant is the control environment By focusing their attention on and communicating their intent to reduce improper payments throughout an organization and to all affected organizational units and individuals top level officials whether in the government or within private sector companies and legislative bodies set the stage for change They instill a culture of accountability by adopting a positive and supportive attitude toward improvement and the achievement of established program outcomes They also establish a transparent environment in which their expectations for program improvement are clearly defined and accountability for achieving these improvements is set The actions of the entities in our study in areas including passing legislation setting and maintaining the ethical tone delegating roles and responsibilities and implementing human capital initiatives clearly communicated the need for change We were told by many of the officials we met in the course of our work that without the clearly established expectations and demands for improvement by top management and legislative officials little would have happened to effectively reduce fraud and errors in their programs However it is important to note that while top management sets the tone for cultural change everyone from program managers to staff performing day to day operational activities must buy into this change and work to achieve its overall goals The cultural change fostered by an effective control environment stresses the importance of improvement and efficient and effective program operations while maintaining a balance with concerns raised regarding privacy and information security in a world where computers and electronic data are indispensable for making payments In the legislative arena it involved passing laws requiring certain actions by agency or program management the use of various prevention and or detection methodologies and periodic agency reporting on the status of improvement efforts At the agency or program level it included management s public commitment to reduce fraud and errors as There are two ways to stop fraud one is to lock up everythingaround you andthe other is to surround yourself with ethical people Chris Linton Certified Fraud Examiner National Advisor Fraud Prevention and Investigation New Zealand s Inland Revenue Department well as annual performance reporting and follow up actions based on performance results Top level interest in the amount of improper payments at the organizations that participated in our study often resulted from program audit and or media reports of misspent funds or fraudulent activities As the magnitude of these improper payments became known pressures increased on government officials and legislative bodies to reduce them In Texas the legislature was instrumental in effecting changes to the state s benefit programs through provisions in several pieces of legislation The legislature s involvement was precipitated in 1996 by the reported amounts of improper payments in Texas Medicaid program estimated to range from 365 million to 730 million or 4 to 8 percent of total expenditures and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families TANF and Food Stamp programs estimated at a total of 222 4 million or about 8 percent of total expenditures for the two programs Texas lawmakers sought to reduce improper payments by mandating specific actions by responsible agencies including the use of computer technology to identify and deter fraud and abuse in the Texas Medicaid program In addition the lawmakers called for publicizing successful fraud prosecutions and fraud prevention programs to deter benefit fraud Australia and New Zealand prepared and adopted a joint standard 7on risk management to provide a cultural framework for managing risk Risk management is the term applied to a logical and systematic method of managing risks associated with any activity function or process in a way that will enable organizations to minimize losses and maximize opportunities The philosophy makes risk management a part of its organizational culture and integrates risk management into its day to day practices and business activities When this is achieved risk management becomes the business of everyone in the organization People are what make internal controls work and the integrity and ethical values maintained and demonstrated by management play a key role in the entire organization s ethical tone After the identification of significant internal fraud New Zealand s Inland Revenue Department IRD created the position of National Advisor Fraud Prevention and Investigation and adopted a fraud control strategy The primary aim of the strategy is to enable responsible conduct where the need to obey the law and to behave ethically is part of the organization s ethos Accordingly IRD has adopted a code of conduct applicable to all employees that explains the standards of integrity and behavior expected In the experience of IRD s National Advisor Fraud Prevention and Investigation employees are often provided a copy of the code of conduct 7 Joint Australian New Zealand Standard 4360 1999 was prepared by the Joint Technical Committee OB 7 Risk Management It was approved on behalf of the Council of Standards Australia on April 2 1999 and on behalf of the Council of Standards New Zealand on March 22 1999 It was published on April 12 1999 Referenced material is from pages iii and 1 of the standard Good customer service is accurate customer service While timeliness is important quality and accuracy aremore important and will ultimately improve timeliness anyway Sue Vardon Chief Executive Officer Centrelink on their first day of work along with a large volume of other paperwork and never actually read the code unless the code is breached To heighten employee awareness IRD holds roundtable discussions with new and seasoned employees which bring the code to life in terms of everyday business activity While many organizations have programs to deter and detect fraudulent payments improper payments resulting from miscalculation and other errors often receive inadequate attention Centrelink a one stop shop that pays a variety of Australian government benefits has recently made it its business to improve payment accuracy Centrelink was established in 1997 with a strong focus on customer service and the goal of paying beneficiaries promptly However in recent years internal and external audit reports showed that Centrelink had to some extent traded quality for timeliness Centrelink s own internal review showed that up to 30 percent of all work was rework because it was not done correctly the first time The organization s management responded by implementing a Getting it Right strategy in 2000 which established a tone for change by setting out the roles and responsibilities of managers and team leaders including setting clear and measurable goals in line with Centrelink s strategic framework and meeting performance measures and minimum standards to be applied by all staff in establishing proof of identity of customers managing records keeping technical knowledge and skills current recording reasons for payment decisions and checking work comprehensively Centrelink has distributed posters and mouse pads to reinforce the Getting it Right message and has provided resources to staff on how to reach minimum standards Through implementation of the Getting it Right strategy the Centrelink Chief Executive Officer has stated that she expects a reduction in improper payments as well as continued timeliness in payments to beneficiaries Activities that must be undertaken for each program to ensure the quality of assessment and services provided are being developed A number have already been released for implementation in Centrelink s Customer Service Centre network 8 In June 2001 the Department of Social Security was renamed the Department for Work and Pensions DWP 9 Amounts included in this report have been converted to U S dollars using the following exchange rates effective April 16 2001 for one U S dollar 0 697064 British pounds 1 95665 Australian dollars and 2 43533 New Zealand dollars Putting it Right detecting when payments go wrong and taking prompt action to correct them with appropriate penalties to prevent recurrence and Making Sure Our Strategy Works monitoring progress evaluating the strength of controls and making adjustments where needed DWP s strategy also established performance measures for the reduction of the amount of losses from fraud and error in the Income Support and Jobseeker s Allowance benefit programs To kick off its new program DWP launched a publicity campaign against benefit cheats to shift public attitude and promote intolerance toward those who defraud the benefit system Additionally television commercials billboards newspaper articles and an antifraud Web site www targetingfraud gov uk communicated the government s message to the public that fraud and abuse of the benefits system would not be tolerated Parliament has also stayed actively involved in benefit payment reform and improper payment reductions For example it enacted legislation authorizing data sharing activities within and between government agencies and departments Also the Treasury requires departments to disclose instances of irregular expenditures arising from erroneous benefit awards and fraud by claimants Further the Comptroller and Auditor General has qualified his opinion on DWP s fiscal year 1995 through fiscal year 2000 financial statements because of the level of fraud and error identified in the benefit programs This served to reinforce the message that high levels of improper payments are unacceptable in the United Kingdom Among the organizations we studied the pressures applied by oversight entities and top management were instrumental as change agents They not only defined and communicated a need for improved program operations but most important they redefined the organizational culture Further by being transparent in redefining the culture oversight entities and top management set expectations and obtained buy in on the need for and importance of change from individuals throughout the organizations This was critical for success since these individuals managed the day to day program activities Further a culture of accountability was essential to begin the critical next step in managing improper payments the risk assessment process Strategies to Consider Control Environment To create a control environment that instills a culture of accountability over improper payments the following strategies should be considered provide leadership in setting and maintaining the agency s ethical code of conduct and in ensuring proper behavior under the code provide a cultural framework for managing risk by engaging everyone in the organization in the risk management process increase accountability by establishing goals for reducing improper payments for major programs and foster an atmosphere that regards improper payments as unacceptable Risk Assessment Determining the Nature and Extent of the Problem One of the worst problems an organization confronts is the problem of institutional denial An organization should not simply say We know we have a problem but we don t want to know how big it is Aurora LeBrun Associate Commissioner Office of Investigations and Enforcement Texas Health and Human Services Commission Strong systems of internal control provide reasonable assurance that programs are operating as intended and are achieving expected outcomes A key step in the process of gaining this assurance is conducting a risk assessment an activity that entails a comprehensive review and analysis of program operations to determine where risks exist and what those risks are and then measuring the potential or actual impact of those risks on program operations In performing a risk assessment management should consider all significant interactions between the entity and other parties as well as all internal factors at both the organizationwide and program levels Once risk areas are identified their potential impact on programs and activities should be measured and additional controls should be considered As risks are addressed and controls are changed they should occasionally be revisited to determine where the risks have decreased and where new areas of risk may exist As such the risk assessment process should be iterative The information developed during a risk assessment forms the foundation or basis upon which management can determine the nature and type of corrective actions needed and it gives management baseline information for measuring progress in reducing improper payments The specific risk analysis methodology used can vary by organization because of differences in missions and the difficulty in qualitatively and quantitatively assigning risk levels In addition because governmental economic industry regulatory and operating conditions continually change risk assessments should be periodically updated to identify and deal with any special risks prompted by such changes The organizations that participated in our study found that conducting risk assessments to determine the nature and extent of their improper payments was an essential step in helping them focus on the most significant problem areas and determine what needed to be done to address the identified risks in those areas Many federal agencies even those with recognized weaknesses that result in improper payments do not perform risk assessments to identify and estimate the magnitude of improper payments within their programs However some agencies do perform risk assessments For example the Department of Health and Human Services HHS began reporting an annual estimate of improper payments in the Medicare Fee for Service program in 1996 In fiscal year 2000 it reported estimated improper Medicare Fee for Service payments of 11 9 billion or about 7 percent of such benefits HHS reporting and analysis of improper Medicare payments has helped lead to the implementation of several initiatives to identify and reduce such payments These initiatives include working with providers to ensure that medical records support billed services A thorough risk assessment also allows entities to target high risk areas and therefore to focus often limited resources where the greatest exposure exists For example the Illinois Department of Public Aid IDPA conducted a 1998 comparison of Medicaid payments made with information and documentation associated with the claims to determine if the payments were accurate From this information the IDPA calculated that the state s payment accuracy rate was about 95 percent The review identified errors and their causes and provided IDPA with information that allowed it to focus attention on the 5 percent of inaccurate payments and target strategies to improve the accuracy of these payments For example of the 37 2 million spent for nonemergency transportation services included in the study 11 55 million 31 percent were estimated to be in error The payment accuracy review and three other studies led to a series of actions that included assuring that transportation providers actually existed and were providing services assuring that providers billed Medicaid correctly and sending notices to let providers know what is expected of them Texas has performed two reviews of the accuracy of its health care payments one in December 1998 and a second in January 2001 Both reviews of the Medicaid program were designed to measure the incidence of potential overpayments that could be due to fraud and abuse The 2001 study used three different types of analyses client telephone interviews data analysis identifying billing trends that are known to result in overpayments and medical record review Documentation errors clerical errors and potential fraud and abuse were identified Texas used the results to improve its fraud and abuse detection process by considering certain high risk areas in the development of data analysis techniques in its Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Detection System MFADS For example it recommended an increase in analyses targeted at medical supplies and durable medical equipment and at providers who bill higher cost procedure codes to maximize their reimbursement Both Texas and Illinois found the first time payment accuracy review to be expensive 250 000 and 400 000 in direct costs respectively However both states recognized that the cost of risk assessments would decrease after the baseline measurement had been determined and found them to be cost beneficial in light of the ability to focus on high risk areas Resources are maximized when strategically aimed at the areas that need the most improvement Thus they regarded the payment accuracy review as an effective and cost beneficial way to combat improper payments Government agencies in other countries also use payment accuracy reviews to identify risk areas For example the Department of Social Security in the United Kingdom uses the results of a rolling program of reviews to determine the levels of fraud and error in its Income Support and Jobseeker s Allowance benefit programs Specifically these reviews quantify the amount of fraud customer error and official error error by government employees affecting benefit claims The government uses the October 1997 through September 1998 review results as a baseline against which the results of subsequent reviews are measured Further DWP in the United Kingdom plans to use this information to target areas for prevention and detection in the benefit programs to identify customers who are at risk for higher levels of error in their claims and to facilitate case interventions Control activities will not be fully effective until everyone from the person on the counter through to the head of the agency takes responsibility for managing risk from the perspective of their respective positions Ralph Watzlaff General Manager Professional Review Division Australian Health Insurance Commission In our study of activities to reduce improper payments risk assessments identified problem areas and resulted in estimates of monetary values associated with the problems Thus the process of doing risk assessments was essential for evaluating the feasibility and cost effectiveness of the various corrective actions considered The organizations viewed risk assessments as opportunity and identified risk areas were communicated throughout the organization Assessing its risks allows an organization to set goals and target its efforts to reduce improper payments Having developed such a framework an organization is well positioned to determine which control activities to implement to reduce risks and ultimately reduce fraud and errors Strategies to Consider Risk Assessment To assess risk by determining the nature and extent of improper payments the following strategies should be considered institute a systematic process to estimate the level of improper payments being made by the organization based on this process determine where risks exist what those risks are and the potential or actual impact of those risks on program operations use risk assessment results to target high risk areas and focus resources where the greatest exposure exists and reassess risks on a recurring basis to evaluate the impact of changing conditions both external and internal on program operations Control Activities Taking Action to Address Identified Risk Areas There are no brownie points for just talking about the problem Joan McQuay National Benefit Control and Debt Manager Work and Income New Zealand Once an organization has identified areas of its operations that are at risk and quantified the possible extent of the risk and its management and other key officials are committed to and have set a goal for reducing the risk the organization must take action to achieve that goal Control activities are the policies procedures techniques and mechanisms that are designed to help ensure that management s decisions and plans are carried out They include activities designed to address risks that lead to fraud and error They are an integral part of an organization s actions in planning implementing reviewing and achieving effective results The control activities used by an organization to address improper payments vary according to the specific threats faced and risks incurred differences in objectives managerial judgment size and complexity of the organization operational environment sensitivity and value of data and requirements for system reliability availability and performance Additionally they must comply with all relevant laws and help strike a balance between the sometimes competing goals of privacy and program integrity Control activities can include both prepayment and postpayment mechanisms to manage improper payments Given the large volume and complexity of federal payments and historically low recovery rates for certain programs it is generally most efficient to pay bills and provide benefits properly in the first place Aside from minimizing overpayments proactively preventing improper payments increases public confidence in the administration of benefit programs and avoids the difficulties associated with the pay and chase 10aspects of recovering improper payments However recognizing that some overpayments are inevitable agencies also need to adopt effective detection techniques to quickly identify and recover them Detection activities play a significant role not only in identifying improper payments but also in providing data 10 Pay and chase refers to the labor intensive and time consuming practice of trying to recover overpayments once they have already been made rather than preventing improper payments in the first place on why these payments were made and in turn highlighting areas that need strengthened prevention controls The organizations in our study used many different prevention and detection control activities to manage improper payments The nature of these activities ranged from sophisticated computer analyses of beneficiary and program participant data to postaward contract audits The kinds of activities pursued were dictated by the types of payment activities each entity had identified as presenting the most significant risk of improper payments as well as the kind of data and other resources that were available to the entity in this effort This guide discusses the following six kinds of control activities data sharing data mining neural networking recovery auditing contract audits and prepayment investigations The data sharing data mining and neural networking techniques discussed in this guide are powerful internal control tools that provide more useful and timely access to information The use of these techniques can achieve potentially significant savings by identifying client related reporting errors and misinformation during the eligibility determination process before payments are made or by detecting improper payments that have been made However the more extensive use of personal information in an evolving technological environment raises new questions about privacy and how it should be protected In the federal arena such activities must be implemented consistent with all protections of the Privacy Act of 1974 as amended by the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 and other privacy statutes Data sharing allows entities that make payments to contractors vendors or participants in benefit programs to compare information from different sources to help ensure that payments are appropriate For government agencies data sharing can be particularly useful in confirming initial or continuing eligibility of participants in benefit programs and in identifying improper payments that have already been made 11 A form of data sharing that Texas has found to be effective for determining the initial eligibility of individuals for Food Stamp benefits puts information from several state and local agencies in 11See also Benefit and Loan Programs Improved Data Sharing Could Enhance Program Integrity GAO HEHS 00 119 September 13 2000 the hands of state caseworkers by means of a vendor provided software program The vendor maintains public information such as that recorded by local department of motor vehicles or municipal courts where it can be easily searched by caseworkers to evaluate information provided by individuals applying for benefits Using the software caseworkers can target questions to applicants when there are discrepancies between information provided by the clients and that recorded elsewhere Caseworkers can search the database for data such as driver s license information records showing the number of individuals or vehicles at the clients reported addresses telephone numbers vehicle values boat and motor files criminal convictions marriage divorce records and consumer credit reports Then for example if the data search shows two cars at an applicant s address when the benefit applicant has reported only one the caseworker can at the time of the benefit application question the applicant concerning this discrepancy Generally this query information is treated only as a case clue and must be verified The database contains reporting options that allow supervisors to monitor employees use of the system to ensure that all queries are appropriate in addition the state s internal auditor monitors the staff s use of the database Beyond determining initial eligibility of participants in benefit programs data sharing can also be used to identify improper payments that have already been made Data sharing allows a flow of information in two directions which is particularly helpful to some organizations in managing improper payments For example the Social Security Administration SSA obtains death records from states to determine if deceased individuals are receiving benefit checks At the same time SSA provides data to states and other agencies Among the data it shares is notification of whether there is a valid social security number to confirm the eligibility of an applicant for various state or federal benefit programs The exchange of information allows data matches to take place a process in which information from one source is compared with information from another to identify any inconsistencies Data matches of social security numbers and other data can help determine whether beneficiaries are receiving payments inappropriately or under more than one name or address SSA performs over 20 data matches with over 10 federal agencies and more than 3 500 state and local entities using incoming information Additionally SSA shares outgoing information with federal agencies through more than 15 matches For example SSA shares data with the Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD so it can perform a match to verify the identity of recipients of housing benefits and identify potentially fraudulent claims SSA uses data matches to prevent and detect improper payments in its programs It estimates that it saves 350 million annually for Old Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance and 325 million annually for Supplemental Security Income through the use of data matching Further the savings are not limited to SSA data matches save 1 5 billion for other governmentagencies each year those realized by SSA According to SSA its matches save approximately 1 5 billion each year for other agencies 12 Data matches to identify improper payments can be performed periodically i e daily monthly or yearly or on an ad hoc basis using various sources of data to reconfirm eligibility of beneficiaries and accuracy of payments Texas conducts both periodic and ad hoc matches using data including prisoner information obtained from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and SSA s Prisoner Verification System to determine whether prisoners are receiving benefits to which they are not entitled deceased individuals lists obtained from the Texas Department of Health Bureau of Vital Statistics to determine whether benefits are being paid to such individuals and income information obtained from the Texas Employees Retirement System to check retiree income for amounts that affect the level of benefit eligibility Texas also shares data with three of its bordering states to determine duplicity of benefits which for the four states has resulted in an average of 337 potential duplicates per state per quarter In fiscal year 2000 after researching potential duplicate payments Texas denied or decreased benefits in 656 cases resulting in approximately 578 000 in benefits saved Kentucky performs data matches to determine eligibility for Food Stamps TANF and Medicaid benefits using an integrated automated system that lets caseworkers determine eligibility for the three programs simultaneously At the time the application is entered into the system the system performs several matches to obtain additional information on the applicant and prevent duplicate participation These matches are made through its income eligibility and verification system using the applicant s social security number name date of birth any previous disqualification record from assistance programs and income In addition on a monthly basis other matches are conducted The state matches data with the National Crime Information Center to check for fleeing felons with SSA to determine if any clients are in prison or have died and with assistance programs in other states to check for client disqualification In addition matches with unemployment and state wages records are done monthly When these matches result in information that could require changes in benefits the matches appear on the daily case status reports alerting caseworkers to potential changes in benefits The United Kingdom formalized data matching between government organizations in 1995 and it reported that through March 2000 it had realized benefit savings of about 450 million From April 1999 through 12 SSA calculates the annual savings based on a compilation of cost benefit analyses performed by the matching agencies under the terms of their matching agreements with SSA March 2000 matches identified about 217 000 inconsistencies for further investigation and resulted in an overall benefit saving of about 53 million Additionally legislation has now been passed to enable the government to obtain financial information from the private sector in certain circumstances The prevalence of data sharing is evidence of the value provided to agencies when they can obtain and use data from sources external to an individual program s systems Having the two streams of data allows for matches to occur and inconsistencies or anomalies to be flagged for further research Federal entities contemplating data matching must do so in accordance with the provisions of the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act which requires that 1 the privacy of data used in computer matches be protected 2 agencies complete cost benefit analyses on all computer matches and report annually on their findings unless the matches are exempted by law and 3 data integrity boards be established to approve and review the data matches While data sharing gives an organization the means to compare data from different sources data mining offers a tool to review and analyze diverse data Data mining analyzes data for relationships that have not previously been discovered For example the incidence of improper payments among Medicaid claims might if sufficiently analyzed and related to other Medicaid data reveal a correlation with a certain health care provider or providers The central repository of data commonly used to perform data mining is called a data warehouse Data warehouses store historical and current data and consist of tables of information that are logically grouped together The warehouse allows program and financial data from different nonintegrated systems throughout an organization to be captured and placed in a single database where users can query the system for information The information can then be mined or searched according to specific criteria to identify associations sequences patterns and clusters between different pieces of information relationships that are often hidden in separated databases As a tool in managing improper payments applying data mining to a data warehouse allows an organization to efficiently query the system to identify questionable activities such as multiple payments for an individual invoice or to an individual recipient on a certain date This technique allows personnel who are not computer specialists but who may have useful program or financial expertise to directly access data target queries and analyze results Queries can also be made through data mining software which includes prepared queries that can be used in the system on a regular basis IDPA began data mining in an effort to improve a system that was too slow to provide the timely information needed for a wide range of agency functions including the prevention and detection of overpayments As of December 2000 the state had spent 29 million to create a data warehouse to supplement the Medicaid Management Information System MMIS which maintains data on Medicaid providers and beneficiaries as well as claims and payments The data warehouse includes over 2 000 different fields elements The results of data queries are particularly useful because the data warehouse is able to store more current data than MMIS At present there is a 1 month lag in current information compared to the 3 to 6 month lag that existed before IDPA began using data mining In addition the data warehouse can now store up to 5 years of data and IDPA is currently weighing the costs and benefits of increasing this to 10 years of data IDPA officials noted that using data mining allows them to analyze large amounts of data Because the large number of transactions in the system precludes manually examining each transaction for associations and patterns with other transactions data mining is an effective and efficient alternative The IDPA Office of Inspector General OIG also uses data mining to quickly respond to requests for information for ongoing investigations from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois State Police The IDPA OIG created the Fraud Science Team FST an interdisciplinary team that includes an economist program and policy experts and information specialists FST maximizes the value of the data warehouse by performing data mining activities and providing a research based approach to fraud prevention and detection FST has produced documentation on over 800 fraud schemes which it has categorized into 19 different types such as billing for services not rendered and kickback schemes The information on these schemes is used in the development and implementation of targeted analyses that are run against the data warehouse information to identify data relationships and anomalies which are often signs of fraud This information can also be used to implement specific controls in the system intended to prevent the identified types of fraud During our visit the IDPA OIG staff ran several queries and analyses For example one risk area identified was health care providers that were billing for services provided in excess of 24 hours in a single day With the capabilities of the data warehouse OIG staff developed an analysis that identified 18 providers that had billed over 24 hours for at least 1 day during the 6 months ended December 31 1999 A number of the identified providers were already under investigation for other program violations As a result of this analysis the OIG plans to refer serious cases to appropriate law enforcement agencies and take administrative action against the less serious violators An early effort at using data mining software in Illinois has identified 1 7 million in potential overpayments Before the data warehouse was available obtaining responses to queries of this kind would have required obtaining separate reports from different systems and could have taken up to 2 months However during our visit querying the warehouse took from several seconds to a few minutes per query New initiatives that Illinois expects will further improve data mining at IDPA are the development of a 3 day training course to help users properly structure queries and the use of data mining software In an early effort using data mining software IDPA OIG as part of a partnership audit with HHS OIG identified 232 hospital transfers that are believed to have been miscoded as discharges creating a potential overpayment of 1 7 million The large number of computerized claims processed by Medicare also lends itself to the application of data mining techniques Claims administration contractors at HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services formerly the Health Care Financing Administration use data mining and statistical analysis as part of their postpayment review activities Since 1993 CMS also has contracted with a specialized statistical analysis contractor to perform large scale analysis of durable medical equipment claims Data mining can identify many potentially inappropriate payments but determining which ones are actual overpayments takes additional investigation Currently the contractors only have the resources to investigate situations in which the data indicate potential large scale abusive practices Neural networking is a technique for extracting and analyzing data In this case the system analyzes associations and patterns among data elements which allows it to find relationships that can result in new queries A neural network is intended to simulate the way in which a brain processes information learns and remembers A neural network is initially trained or fed large amounts of data and rules about data relationships for example a person s grandfather is older than that person s father Neural networks learn by comparing new data with historical data and can be used to detect patterns that are difficult and sometimes impossible to detect without computer intervention in large volumes of data The more data a neural network processes the better it performs i e the better it identifies the characteristics of potentially fraudulent payments Based upon this knowledge neural networks automatically alter their analytical processes to produce more accurate detection results In 1997 the Texas legislature mandated the use of neural networks in the Medicaid program After examining the results of a pilot test Texas Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Detection System used neural networking to recover 3 4 million in fiscal year 2000 of neural networks conducted by the Comptroller s Office Texas Health and Human Services Commission HHSC responded to the legislation and implemented MFADS The MFADS project was operational in January 1998 and combines both data mining and neural network capabilities In Texas models used with the neural network technology identify fraudulent patterns from large volumes of medical claims and patient and provider history data For example they can help identify perpetrators of both known and unknown fraud schemes through the analysis of utilization trends patterns and complex interrelationships in the data The state currently has models for physician and dental providers and plans to initiate a model for pharmaceutical providers HHSC awarded a contract for the development and operational support of MFADS Annual contract costs range from 2 6 million to 3 1 million for contractor operations that include the development and ongoing support of the models The Texas models are composed of 500 to 600 variables and generate an annual report that identifies the potential unscrupulous providers and ranks the providers according to how questionable their billing patterns appear to be The models detail the variances through graphs that compare amounts billed and services rendered among others items by the identified provider with the average of the other providers For example one dental provider was ranked third on a dental model listing due to unusual activity in areas such as multisurface restoration and root canal activities An investigator using MFADS was able to run detailed reports on the provider s activity in the identified high risk areas and determined that the combination of services provided volume of services provided and the recurring pattern of the services provided were indeed suspicious Additionally a dental consultant reviewed 100 of the provider s dental charts and determined that many of the services claimed were unnecessary As a result the provider agreed to a settlement and has repaid the identified overpayments of 162 000 plus other penalties Additionally the provider was excluded from the Medicaid program for 15 years The results from both the data mining activities and the neural network reports are reviewed and possibly investigated to determine if the claims are fraudulent or the providers are unscrupulous According to Texas officials medical judgment is important when considering the accuracy of claims and as such medical professionals assist in reviewing medical claims Texas HHSC prepares quarterly reports for the legislature s review The Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2001 Contract Performance Report for the Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Detection System reported that it had identified 2 567 cases representing over 6 million for investigation in fiscal year 2000 As a result of investigating these cases approximately 3 4 million has been recovered These reports also show how HHSC is performing in relation to its performance measures In fiscal year 2000 one of the performance measures was that total dollars identified for recoveries equal or exceed 139 percent 3 7 million of the fiscal year contract cost amount HHSC exceeded its goal by identifying 6 1 million for recovery Recovery auditing is the practice of identifying and recovering overpayments that examines payment file information to identify possible duplicate or erroneous payments For instance vendors make pricing errors on their invoices forget to include discounts that have been publicized to the general public neglect to offer allowances and rebates miscalculate freight charges and so forth In addition the same invoices or portions thereof could be paid more than once These mistakes when not caught result in overpayments Recovery auditing can incorporate data mining techniques While traditionally used as a technique to identify improper payments already made organizations have also experienced success in using recovery auditing to analyze records prior to payment Because it helps to prevent improper payments before they occur this use of recovery auditing eliminates the costs associated with obtaining reimbursements for the erroneous payments or taking other actions needed to offset future payments by the amount of the improper payment Recovery auditing started about 30 years ago and it is used in several industries including the automobile retail store and food service industries and to some extent within the federal government Some entities use their employees to analyze their payment records while others contract with recovery audit firms for the work Contract firms often perform this work on a contingency fee basis that is they only receive compensation if they identify and recover amounts determined to be improper payments As discussed below recovery auditing which has a long standing track record in the private sector offers an opportunity to identify improper payments before they occur and to identify and recover overpayments if they do occur One private sector company contracted on a contingency fee basis with a recovery audit firm for a review of its accounts payable files files in which its systems controls had not found errors The review resulted in the recovery of 8 million in improper payments The company recently began using recovery auditing techniques on accounts payable information to prevent improper payments before they occurred It expected that this activity would identify possible duplicate payments and the test verified the company s expectations For example during our visit it identified and avoided a duplicate payment of 136 000 from the reports generated by the recovery audit A private sector companyrecovered 8 million in improper payments as a result of a recovery audit software In addition as a result of using recovery auditing before payments are made the company identified and stopped the processing of 41 million in wire payments that had already been processed Another advantage of the recovery audit services used by the company is that the software identifies the employees who are making processing errors so that the company can take appropriate counseling and training action Another private sector company contracted with a recovery audit firm on a contingency fee basis to perform two separate reviews of its disbursements the first review was for disbursements made from 1992 through 1995 and the second for disbursements made from 1996 through 1998 Both reviews identified duplicate payments and resulted in recovery actions and in changes to the payment system to help reduce future overpayments For example from 1996 through 1998 the company processed about 9 million invoices The recovery audit review of these invoices identified about 5 million in potential overpayments and resulted in actions to recover these funds where appropriate Further based on an analysis of the overpayments identified the company has implemented procedures that have reduced its dollar error rate per one million dollars of transactions from a reported 65 in 1992 through 1995 to a reported 34 dollars in 1996 through 1998 In addition the company is now preparing to enter an agreement with the recovery audit contractor under which the recovery auditing software will be installed in the company s system allowing its staff to perform the recovery audit function even as part of the prepayment process Recovery auditing is also being used to some extent in the federal government For example the Department of Veterans Affairs VA Financial Services Center FSC in Austin Texas had contracted with recovery audit firms in the past but now performs recovery auditing in house using about three full time employees to administer the program and one employee for software development If a duplicate payment is identified VA takes one of several actions including canceling the transaction prior to payment notifying Treasury to stop issuance of a check or issuing a bill of collection For example FSC has identified over 2 million in overpayments and has collected by either offsetting future payments or cash collection nearly 300 000 for the first 6 months of fiscal year 2001 A FSC official noted that recovery auditing could be beneficial to almost any organization that makes payments Postaward audits of contracts are another technique that can help to combat improper payments and are used to some degree within the federal government These audits verify that VA reported recoveries of 119 million from contract audits payments are being made in accordance with contract terms and applicable regulations They can detect improper payments that have been made help avoid future payments of the same kind and provide oversight of companies conducting business with the government For example in fiscal year 1993 the VA Office of Acquisition and Materiel Management partnered with the VA OIG and the VA Office of General Counsel to establish the VA Procurement Working Group PWG As a result a Contract Review and Evaluation Division was established to provide audit and advisory services related to contracts awarded by contracting officers in VA s Office of Acquisition and Materiel Management From 1993 through September 2000 PWG reported recoveries resulting from postaward audits of contracts totaling about 119 million This represents a reported return of 18 for every dollar spent in support of these audits PWG attributes its success to the establishment of a knowledgeable and professional group of contract auditors in the pharmaceutical and medical surgical supply industries As a result of the audits and PWG s efforts many contractors have voluntarily elected to perform internal reviews and have submitted 65 voluntary disclosures and refund offers to VA Prior to 1993 VA received almost no voluntary disclosures Some contractors have also developed and implemented corporate responsibility plans to ensure compliance with acquisition regulations and statutes Illinois reports saving 12 for every dollar spent on fraud prevention investigations In 1996 IDPA established a Fraud Prevention Investigations Program FPI to prevent ineligible persons from receiving Food Stamps TANF and Medicaid Under this program case managers in the Illinois Department of Human Services IDHS refer applications that contain suspicious or conflicting information to IDPA s Bureau of Investigations BOI for action before benefit payments begin Case managers use certain referral criteria such as applications that contain contradictory information about household composition or employment to identify these applications BOI submits referred cases to a private investigation firm under contract with the IDPA OIG which investigates the information on the application This investigation may consist of interviews contacts with employers landlords or neighbors or a visit to the applicant s home The results are reported to BOI within 8 business days 5 business days for food stamps and then to the local IDHS office for appropriate action approval denial or reduction of benefits The program was piloted in 1995 and was implemented in 1996 with five Cook County Chicago IDHS offices participating Currently all 23 IDHS local offices in Cook County participate in the program FPI reports total savings since program inception of about 12 for every dollar spent Specifically in fiscal year 2000 FPI prevented 9 5 million in improper payments from being issued at a cost of 823 000 Savings are calculated based on the administrative and contract costs of the program as a percentage of gross savings and cost avoidance for cases that resulted in denied or reduced benefits The preceding examples of control activities are meant to illustrate a sample of the type of activities that may be useful to agency managers An agency s internal control activities should be flexible weighing costs and benefits to allow agencies to tailor control activities to fit their special needs Once control activities are in place the internal control cycle continues with the prompt communication of information that managers need to help them carry out these activities and run their operations efficiently and effectively Strategies to Consider Control Activities In taking action to address identified risks the following strategies should be considered based on an analysis of the specific risks facing the organization and taking into consideration the nature of the organization and the environment in which it operates determine which types of control activities would be most effective in addressing the identified risks where in house expertise is not available investigate the possibility of contracting activities out to firms that specialize in specific areas such as recovery auditing and neural networking perform cost benefit analyses of potential control activities before implementation to help ensure that the cost of those activities to the organization is not greater than the potential benefit control ensure that personnel involved in developing maintaining and implementing control activities have the requisite skills and knowledge recognizing that staff expertise needs to be frequently updated in evolving areas such as information technology and fraud investigation and recognize and consider the importance of privacy and information security issues when developing and implementing control activities Information and Communications Using and Sharing Knowledge to Manage Improper Payments Top level agency officials program managers and others responsible for managing and controlling program operations need relevant reliable and timely financial and nonfinancial information to make operating decisions monitor performance and allocate resources This information can be obtained from a variety of sources using a wide range of data collection methodologies The organizations that participated in our study used internal and external sources to obtain needed information Further these sources varied widely from information contained in multiple computer databases to periodic meetings of individuals to share information on emerging issues and other areas relevant to effective program operations The need for information and communication extends beyond organizational boundaries Many of the governmental programs with improper payments are benefit programs that involve recipients and providers of services Organizations in our study developed educational programs to assist these participants in understanding eligibility and other requirements and for service providers information on issues including common claim filing errors Having information available to provide feedback to management on initiatives is necessary to adequately evaluate performance At Centrelink in Australia information showing achievement against key performance indicators KPI for compliance activity is provided to managers monthly within 9 days of the end of the month Information is provided about the number of compliance reviews cases identified as high risk for incorrect payment completed savings incorrect payments identified for recovery and the level of incorrect payment Information is also provided on prosecution activity In addition comparative information is made available so that the managers see how they are doing compared to other managers While these reports are available within 9 days of the end of the reporting period a database containing review information can be accessed within 48 hours This enables managers to produce detailed flexible reports on line As a result We are always working to achieve balance between program integrity and access to health care for recipients Robb Miller Inspector General Illinois Department of Public Aid of having this timely information managers can more effectively manage the resources available to them Minimizing improper payments often requires the exchange of relevant reliable and timely information between individuals and units within an organization and with external entities with oversight and monitoring responsibilities This can be achieved by establishing working groups For example in 1997 Illinois established its Medicaid Fraud Prevention Executive Workgroup The purpose of the workgroup is to develop reasonable and prudent measures consistent with the provision of quality health care to combat fraud and abuse in the Medical Assistance Program The workgroup has approximately 15 members from both the program and integrity sides of IDPA including members from claims processing technical support budget and analysis fraud research investigations information technology and information systems The cooperation between the program and the integrity divisions is the vehicle by which emerging issues are addressed The group meets monthly to discuss the status of previously discussed and or implemented initiatives and to propose and discuss current problems and potential initiatives Topics discussed have resulted in ongoing changes to computer edits and policies reflecting the dynamic nature of fraud While timely accurate and reliable information is necessary for internal use the organizations we visited stressed that communication with the public benefit providers and beneficiaries was also necessary Educating the parties involved in the transaction reduces the risk of potential errors and strengthens joint responsibility and accountability of those involved Texas considers the various forms of education to be costbeneficial in its Medicaid program For example in 1997 it implemented several initiatives to educate new providers before they enroll in the Texas Medicaid program First each new Medicaid provider receives a Success with Medicaid package containing information on claim filing including helpful tips and instructions on how to use the automated phone system for inquiries This welcome package is hand delivered during a site visit by one of Texas 19 Medicaid field representatives Three months after enrollment the field representatives evaluate a sample of each new provider s claims to see if there are any issues that should be discussed Then the same representative who made the initial visit revisits the new provider to answer questions and discuss any problems noted in the claims sample In addition program personnel conduct various workshops for and make educational materials available to new providers In another example Australia s Health Insurance Commission HIC implemented a feedback program to provide medical practitioners with regular information about their own benefit authorization age and gender patient demographics and comparative statistical information showing the number of services rendered and dollar value of benefits paid All 32 000 practitioners receive correspondence once a year from HIC The program s educational feedback encourages compliance and can act as a deterrent to future wrongdoing as practitioners are aware that HIC tracks what is claimed for reimbursement on an annual basis While at first most practitioners did not realize that HIC was able to accumulate and analyze this information the program has now become both an effective deterrent and a desired source of information for the practitioners For example some practitioners have asked for additional information or statistics prior to the annual feedback report In October 1999 the HIC Internet Feedback Reporting Facility was established to provide on line feedback and statistics to general practitioners About 2 100 general practitioners accessed their feedback reports on line during 1999 and HIC implemented further enhancements to include feedback to other medical practitioners Also in Australia Centrelink has determined that 65 percent of its preventable incorrect payments 13relate to incorrect declaration of income by the customer or beneficiary Based on this risk assessment Centrelink developed a range of specific prevention strategies aimed at educating beneficiaries and employers on income reporting requirements These include educating the beneficiaries on the correct way to declare earnings and reminding them of the consequences of failing to correctly declare earnings and outreaching employers in industries whose employees are traditionally more likely to receive improper payments such as those with seasonal or part time employees In the latter case Centrelink provides these employers with materials to distribute to existing and new employees who are receiving benefits from Centrelink For example to encourage accurate income reporting the employers distribute payslips envelopes to employees for their use in storing their wage records In addition to working groups coordination and cooperation with local law enforcement and other sources external to an agency can establish an infrastructure conducive to preventing and detecting fraud Our case illustration shows the value of such an Centrelink defines all incorrect payments as preventable unless the payment is unavoidable such as legislated advance payments Furthermore Centrelink categorizes preventable payments into three areas preventable by the customer preventable by staff and preventable by the system Centrelink reports 410 million to 460 million in incorrect payments a year of which 70 percent is classified as preventable payments infrastructure in preventing large scale Medicaid fraud perpetrators from receiving payment for fraudulent claims Effective communications should occur in a broad sense with information flowing down across and up the organization In addition to internal communications management should ensure there are adequate means of communicating with and obtaining information from external stakeholders that may have a significant impact on the agency achieving its goals Moreover effective information technology management is critical to achieving useful reliable and continual recording and communication of information Program managers need operational and financial data to monitor whether they are meeting their agencies strategic and annual performance plans and meeting their goals for accountability and effective use of resources Monitoring strategies are discussed in the next section Strategies to Consider Information and Communications To effectively use and share knowledge to manage improper payments the following strategies should be considered determine what information is needed by managers to meet and support initiatives aimed at reducing improper payments ensure that needed information is provided to managers in an accurate and timely manner provide managers with timely feedback on applicable performance measures so they can use the information to effectively manage their programs develop educational programs to assist program participants in understanding program requirements ensure that there are adequate means of communicating with and obtaining information from external stakeholders that may have a significant impact on improper payment initiatives such as periodic meetings with oversight bodies and develop working relationships with other organizations to share information and pursue potential instances of fraud or other wrongdoing Monitoring Tracking the Success of Improvement Initiatives We will want to know what action is being taken and what more could be done to get a grip on the burgeoning levels of fraud and inaccuracy in benefit claims David Davis Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts United Kingdom Monitoring performance over time is critical to program management and oversight Evaluation of an organization s programs and its successes in meeting its established goals and in identifying additional actions is an integral element of performance measurement and continued improvement in operations Monitoring focuses on the assessment of the quality of performance over time and on the prompt resolution of problems identified either through separate program evaluations or audits Once an organization has identified its risks related to improper payments and undertaken activities to reduce such risks by upgrading its control activities monitoring performance allows the organization to gauge how well its efforts are working In the United Kingdom the Department for Work and Pensions DWP annually reviews its Income Support and Jobseeker s Allowance programs to estimate the level of fraud and error in the programs measure progress toward meeting established performance goals and report performance results to Parliament As a result of the program monitoring and evaluation activities these reviews permit the government has set new more challenging targets for future performance In addition the National Audit Office NAO in the United Kingdom uses the review results in its annual audits of DWP s financial statements NAO reviews DWP s sampling methodology and sample results reviews some of the cases DWP examined and selects its own sample to verify the accuracy of the reviews The auditing standards issued by the United Kingdom s Audit Practices Board require NAO to plan and perform its audits to provide for reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement whether caused by error or by fraud or other irregularity Further Her Majesty s Treasury requires disclosure in the notes to the financial statements on a cash basis of all instances of significant irregular expenditures arising from erroneous benefit awards and fraud by claimants After considering the results of DWP s review and its evaluation of those results NAO qualified its fiscal year 1995 through fiscal year 2000 opinions on DWP s financial statements because of the amount of fraud and error in the benefit programs NAO has also provided constructive advice on how DWP might improve its internal control and risk management procedures The probability of review should never be zero Not for any provider no matter how reputable nor for any claim no matter how small Malcolm K Sparrow License to Steal Why Fraud Plagues America s Health Care System 1996 Illinois assessed the risk of improper payments in its Medicaid program and based on the results implemented initiatives designed to improve payment accuracy To monitor the effects of the new initiatives Illinois will use random claims sampling to test the accuracy of the payments by reviewing 150 randomly selected claims per month or 1 800 per year The goal of this project is to ensure that every paid claim faces an equal random chance of review The judgment of field staff auditors nurses and policy experts will be used to determine if they are paid correctly This approach not only provides periodic estimates of payment and service accuracy rates to help measure the results of existing enforcement and detection efforts but also helps deter future erroneous and fraudulent billings Performance measures are key to monitoring progress in addressing improper payments New Zealand requires entities from which the government purchases a significant quantity of goods and services to include audited statements of objectives and statements of service performance with their financial statements These statements include where appropriate performance measures related to improper payments For example performance measures relating to entitlement accuracy services to reduce benefit crime and debt management have been established for Work and Income New Zealand WINZ a government agency that provides income support and or employment assistance to eligible people WINZ s financial statements are the main accountability reports used by Parliament to monitor the agency s performance In addition Parliament uses the audited information to make informed decisions on resource allocation and through a Public Service Monitoring Body the State Services Commission to hold the entity s chief executive officer responsible if performance standards are not met For example the government in its role as purchaser can offer rewards and apply sanctions to a chief executive officer to ensure performance In addition the government may seek to purchase goods and services from more than one source WINZ s monitoring of its payment accuracy is discussed further in the case illustration on the following page Monitoring the activities used by an organization to address improper payments should be performed continually and should be ingrained in the entity s operations Ongoing monitoring enables an organization to measure how well it is doing track performance measures and adjust control activities based on the results of monitoring activities The monitoring process should also include policies and procedures for ensuring that the results of the reviews are communicated to the appropriate individuals within the organization so that they can be promptly resolved Strategies to Consider Monitoring To track the success of improvement initiatives the following strategies should be considered establish agency specific goals and measures for reducing improper payments using baseline information for comparison periodically monitor the progress in achieving the established performance measures make the results of performance reviews widely available to permit independent evaluations of the success of efforts to reduce improper payments ensure timely resolution of problems identified by audits and other reviews and adjust control activities as necessary based on the results of monitoring activities Observations Our study identified many techniques and approaches that organizations have used and found effective in reducing their levels of improper payments that could be used by federal agencies to help reduce improper payments in their programs The techniques and approaches shared a common focus of improving the internal control systems over the problem areas and generally included actions in five areas control environment risk assessment control activities information and communications and monitoring Our observations on the key factors for successful actions in each of these areas follow In the area of control environment we found that for improper payment initiatives to be successful setting the tone at the top is critical The pressures applied by top management and oversight entities are instrumental in clearly defining and communicating the need for improved program operations and most important in redefining the organizational culture The goals and objectives of the initiatives being implemented must be transparent to all in the organization Without ongoing strong support both in spirit and in action of top level program officials and legislative bodies the chances for success in implementing the changes needed to address improper payments are slim This top level support is especially critical given that an investment of time and money is often needed in these types of efforts One of the biggest hurdles that many entities face in the process of managing improper payments is overcoming the propensity toward denial of the problem It is easy to rationalize avoiding or deferring taking action to address a problem if you do not know how big the problem is The nature and magnitude of the problem determined through a systematic risk assessment process needs to be determined and openly communicated to all relevant parties When this occurs especially in a strong control environment denial is no longer an option and managers have the information as well as the incentive to begin addressing improper payments This risk assessment is used to determine where risks exist what those risks are and the potential or actual impact of those risks on program operations As such it helps identify the areas most in need of corrective action and helps form a basis for determining how to allocate resources human and monetary to the problem areas By performing risk assessments on a recurring basis organizations also obtain information on the status of their efforts to reduce improper payments and on areas needing further attention In the area of control activities we found that organizations need to tailor their actions to fit their particular needs There is a wide range of activities that can be used to effectively address improper payments These include the use of computer assisted activities ranging from simple comparative analyses e g comparing beneficiaries with mortality rolls to the use of sophisticated computer models for interactive analysis of large amounts of information e g using neural networking to identify suspicious patterns of payments Regardless of the level of sophistication involved the key to success is having the right people perform the right jobs While these technology based solutions can be expensive such investments usually more than pay for themselves in terms of dollars saved They also can be a significant deterrent and provide for a level of program integrity that could not otherwise be achieved When obtaining storing and using computer generated information an organization must always be mindful of privacy and security issues In the federal arena including federal programs managed by state organizations computer assisted activities must be implemented consistent with all protections of the Privacy Act of 1974 as amended by the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 and other privacy statutes We also found that organizations use both computer generated information and nontechnical methods to obtain summarize and communicate information needed to evaluate program performance Whatever method is used the flow of relevant reliable and timely information regarding performance should lead to improved performance particularly if an atmosphere of healthy competition is introduced into the process Educational activities for both beneficiaries and other program participants also serve as an effective communication approach to help reduce improper payments and strengthen program operations The better educated agency employees contractors and beneficiaries are about what is expected of them and the consequences of not meeting those expectations the greater the chances for reducing fraud and errors in the payment process Another key point is that just putting control activities in place is not the end of the process monitoring progress and results is essential and must include the involvement of top level officials In addition to monitoring day to day performance it is important for an organization to track performance over time and measure it against established performance goals or indicators This monitoring activity provides information on the effectiveness of the control activities implemented and helps oversight and top level management officials identify areas needing further attention or a shift in focus High levels of improper payments need not and should not be an accepted cost of running federal programs The organizations that participated in our study found they could effectively and efficiently manage improper payments by 1 changing their organizations control environments or cultures 2 performing risk assessments 3 implementing activities to reduce fraud and errors 4 providing relevant reliable and timely information and communication of results to management and 5 monitoring performance over time In the federal government implementation of this process will likely not be easy or quick It will require strong support not just in words but in actions from the President the Congress top level administration appointees and agency management officials Once committed to a plan of action they must remain steadfast supporters of the end goals and their support must be transparent to all Further there must be a willingness to dedicate the human capital and monetary resources needed to implement the changes In the human capital area this could involve performing needs assessments and taking the actions necessary to hire individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to turn the planned actions into reality Regarding funding many actions that proved successful to the organizations in our study involved computer assisted analyses of data Effectively and efficiently implementing some of these practices could require funding for computer software and hardware additional staff and or training In addition it is important that the results of the actions taken be openly communicated or available not only to the Congress and agency management but also to the general public This transparency demonstrates the importance that the government places on the need for change and openly communicates performance results It also acts as an incentive for agencies to be ever vigilant in their efforts to address the wasteful spending that results from lapses in controls that lead to improper payments Appendix I Objectives Scope and Methodology The objectives of this study were to identify effective practices and provide case illustrations and other information for federal agencies consideration when developing strategies and planning and implementing actions to manage improper payments In performing this study we conducted extensive research and identified three federal agencies three state governments three foreign countries and three private sector companies that took actions that they considered effective in reducing improper payments in their programs In general for the organizations that participated in this study we 1 conducted extensive Internet and literature searches to identify actions that each had taken to reduce improper payments 2 made site visits to interview representatives involved in identifying and taking actions to reduce improper payments and 3 obtained and reviewed organization reports and other documentation describing the actions taken the results of those actions and future plans in the area As outlined below we used several techniques to identify the study participants Federal Agencies We formed a focus group within GAO that was composed of program and financial analysts familiar with each federal agency This group identified agencies that had implemented practices to reduce improper payments Additionally we contacted the inspectors general of the 24 Chief Financial Officers CFO Act agencies to obtain their views on agency activities if any designed to reduce improper payments Once we identified potential participants we conducted extensive Internet searches of their Web sites and reviewed entity and GAO audit reports and other documents to obtain background and other information for potential best practice efforts We then contacted three agencies discussed our study objectives and planned approach and asked each if it had any programs in which actions to reduce improper payments were effective Representatives at the three agencies the Department of Veterans Affairs the Social Security Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services formerly the Health Care Financing Administration identified programs in which their organizations had taken actions considered effective and agreed to participate State Governments We conducted extensive Internet searches for all 50 states to identify reports and other studies that identified states that had taken actions that appeared to identify and reduce improper payments We also coordinated with other GAO representatives to identify states that had taken actions to reduce improper payments in federal programs in which program management is a state responsibility such as the Food Stamp program Based on the information obtained we asked representatives in the states of Illinois Kentucky and Texas if they had any activities that they believed were effective in reducing improper payments Each identified some actions and agreed to participate in the study Private Sector Organizations We contacted the Private Sector Council a public service organization that assists in the sharing of knowledge between the private and public sectors Through this organization three companies volunteered to participate in our study and supplied us with information on the techniques they used and considered effective in reducing improper payments Foreign Governments Our External Liaison Office contacted our counterparts in 12 countries and two world organizations to explain our study objective and ask for input on activities if any each had taken to reduce improper payments in its programs We also conducted extensive Internet searches to identify programs in each of these entities in which actions had been taken to reduce improper payments Based on the responses from our initial requests for information from the countries and organizations and our Internet search results we selected three countries Australia New Zealand and the United Kingdom as possible study participants We contacted representatives for each and they agreed to participate In the course of identifying actions that possible participants in our study had taken to reduce improper payments we identified numerous Web sites that might provide organizations with useful information that they can consider when attempting to address improper payment or other problems in their programs Appendix III lists these resources We conducted our fieldwork from May 2000 through March 2001 We asked officials of the various organizations highlighted in the case illustrations and throughout the report to verify the accuracy of the information presented on their activities and incorporated their comments as appropriate We did not independently verify the accuracy of that information In addition we issued an exposure draft of this executive guide to obtain comments from interested parties including members of the CFO and OIG community OMB and selected professional organizations in the United States and abroad We incorporated comments as appropriate Appendix II Entity Descriptions This appendix provides descriptions of the foreign governments agencies and U S federal agencies state governments and private sector organizations that
