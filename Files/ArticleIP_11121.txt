 Drawing upon her rich experience of life Prudence Prudie to her friends responds to questions about manners personal relations politics and other subjects Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Queries should not exceed 200 words in length Please indicate how you wish your letter to be signed preferably including your location Dear Prudence I work in an office of some 20 people While I have cordial but hardly warm relations with several co workers the only person I genuinely like is a woman who was hired about eight months ago We have become quite friendly verging on affectionate I sense a mutual attraction and I know she is available We re both in our mid 30s Since I both like her and find her desirable I am considering pursuing a relationship However my track record isn t great The last two lasted six and eight months respectively though I have remained friends with both women If this current attraction were to blossom into a relationship I could foresee some happy and soul supportive times but not permanence By the way since she exited a long term relationship just before she joined our company I suspect she s not interested in permanence either So do you think it s worth going into an office relationship that probably won t last We don t work closely together but then again I wouldn t want to hurt or alienate the only person in my office whom I really like And how much disclosure about my track record do you think I should reveal Wondering in New York Dear Won Since we only live once until further notice Prudie thinks it would be a shame to pass up a promising romantic opportunity simply because it may not turn out to be perfect or permanent You are wonderfully thoughtful about looking ahead but try not to plan things that are after all emotional and evolutionary It is Prudie s guess that if you tell the young woman in question of your interest as well as of your concerns her response will be the guide you are seeking As for revealing your strikeout record that kind of information always gets out during the course of what Prudie refers to as the what did you major in discussions Your remark that it probably won t last suggests faulty reasoning You are pessimistically assuming that because no one has interested you on a permanent basis so far no one will For some reason Prudie feels hunchy about your situation and thinks this romantic friendship has possibilities You can t not try to find out And do keep us all posted Prudie encouragingly Dear Prudence Am I an idiot I already know I am an idiot but am I to be a happy idiot or a miserable one Recently I went on a press junket to an Italian island hosted by dull technologists There over two days I fell in with another trapped journalist In the way of such things we now say we are in love On the bright side she is a beautiful terrifyingly honest 24 year old French girl On the other hand I am problematically 31 balding British and bitter My question She wants to move out to California where I live I want her to move out We know nothing about each other What should I do Eager To Be Told What I Want To Hear Dear Eag Let her come This must be Prudie s day to play Cupid because like the chap who wrote the previous letter you sound as though you have serendipitously found someone terrific Take a chance The worst scenario is that you will be dropped on your head in which case you will pick yourself up and begin again without having to wonder if you passed up the love of a lifetime And about the bitter business Prudie assumes this refers to another woman situation The fact that you acknowledge it however reveals a useful self understanding As for being balding Prudie is surely not alone in finding that look attractive even sexy Once again Prudie feels hunchy that the melding of tr s charmant and jolly good could work out brilliantly Prudie sighingly Dear Prudence I put before you an etiquette quandary that I faced a few years ago and may face again I was going regularly to a New York hair salon and getting my hair cut by the salon s owner Was I supposed to tip him Even a hefty 10 or 15 tip seemed a paltry thing to put in the hand of the owner of the salon To me he was the master and tips only seemed appropriate in the case of employees I therefore refrained from handing him a potentially demeaning tip but was still left with the feeling that I should do something After a few visits and no clear advice from my usually sage friends I resolved to give him a copy of a book I had written As a personal gift with no measurable value it seemed a better way to thank him than to price my gratitude at 10 bucks I have moved from New York but if I had stayed I am not sure what I would have given him next What should one do in such a situation Striving for Graciousness in Toronto Dear Strive Well some years ago Barbra Streisand married her hairdresser but that seems an excessive thank you Because you ve left New York your question is hypothetical unless of course you wind up in the same situation again As for not tipping an establishment s owner in terms of etiquette you are correct Prudie a classically trained salon goer recommends a grand gift at Christmastime Such a gift could cost the equivalent of a year s tips if one were so inclined BTW as we say on the Internet or by the way Prudie was recently on your wonderful Bloor Street Prudie grandly Dear Prudence Several of my colleagues and I have noticed that our new supervisor repeatedly interrupts us when we are talking on the phone with our clients She can see the phone she can hear us talking yet she bursts in unwilling to wait This leaves us in the awkward position of wanting but not being able to tell her to go away or at least to cool her jets or being inexcusably rude to others Granted we all have quirks but this is highly unnerving to many of us Your thoughts please Trying Very Hard To Hear You in Michigan Dear Try It sounds as though your new supervisor is 5 years old and hellbent on instant gratification Prudie would suggest that you and your colleagues go to this person s superior and spell out the problem If for some reason this is not feasible write a memo signed Everyone in the department saying you don t wish to be disrespectful but her habit is counterproductive annoying and unnecessary Feel free to point out that callus interruptus is bad for business Prudie uninterruptedly
