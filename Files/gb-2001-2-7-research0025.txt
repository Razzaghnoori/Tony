 Background The sequence of the human nuclear genome has been completed in draft form by an international public consortium consisting of 16 sequencing centers and associated computational facilities 1 A private commercial version of the genome has also been sequenced and assembled using a whole genome shotgun approach 2 Many lower organisms have been sequenced to date 3 but the 3 2 billion base pair bp human genome is approximately 25 times as large as the largest currently finished genomes Drosophila melanogaster at 120 megabases Mb 4 and Arabidopsis thaliana at 115 Mb 5 As of late 2000 the public human sequence was primarily based on approximately 24 000 accessioned bacterial artificial chromosome BAC clones covering 97 of the euchromatic portion of the genome 6 The sequence of these clones is approximately 93 complete to at least 4 fold coverage 7 Thirty percent of the genome is in finished form including the entire sequence of chromosomes 21 and 22 7 These clones represent the most complete sequence information available with overlapping clones positioned on a framework map using restriction fingerprinting 8 However reduction to a single consensus sequence permits placement of genes and other chromosomal structures in their proper positional context Recently the consortium has distributed a working draft assembly of the entire genome that removes redundancies orients sequence fragments and clearly indicates gaps arising from sequencing and assembly The total assembled length is 3 08 billion bp about 4 smaller than estimates of genome size based on flow cytometry 9 presumably due to the exclusion of constitutive heterochromatic regions and centromeres Major gaps 50 200 kilobases kb comprise 16 of the assembly whereas minor gaps 100 or fewer bp and low quality calls comprise 0 5 Large scale sequencing will continue until at least 2003 The current coverage is however sufficient for the Human Genome Project to enter a new phase in which the entire sequence can be analyzed to identify genes regulatory regions and other genomic elements and structures Linkage and genetic association studies can be immediately followed by investigation of candidate regions The assembly provides simplified descriptions of the genome as disparate data sources such as GenBank and numerous expressed sequence tag EST and protein databases are unified Similarly formerly independent maps based on cytogenetic banding patterns meiotic crossovers and radiation hybrids may be placed within the single consensus sequence Results and discussion Combine and conquer Public attention surrounding completion of the draft human sequence has fostered the impression that we are entering a post genomic era and that description of genes and their functions is straightforward However the challenges in genome annotation remain daunting 10 and the research community can anticipate years of additional work and manual curation to produce a true gene map of high quality Functional annotation of the genome is primarily hampered by the lack of a unified transcript index Current transcript information still largely consists of anonymous and highly redundant ESTs The situation is further complicated by extensive splicing variation and elusive gene expression To address these problems the Ensembl consortium relies initially on computational prediction followed by confirmation with EST protein alignments 11 However pure computational approaches can give differing results 12 and may miss 20 or more of transcript supported exons 13 Other gene identification approaches rely on selecting and grouping ESTs into putative gene indices 14 15 or consensus sequences 16 17 These approaches emphasize internal consistency and result in limited EST populations that only partially overlap The genome sequence serves as a powerful arbiter of the quality of EST evidence and will enable consolidation of additional exons into transcriptional units Thus we adopt a more inclusive approach Our approach is to combine the major public cDNA EST and protein databases resolve redundancies and place the resulting exonic sequences uniquely on the genome using the program Blast We refer to these genomic segments technically high scoring segment pairs 18 as exons although the alignment evidence awaits future biological confirmation Splicing evidence was carefully maintained within genomic clones and across clones using the fingerprint map For a given transcript only the best match to genomic sequence using splicing evidence length and high sequence identity was preserved resulting in a unique location for each exonic unit within each database We have successfully applied this approach to integrate UniGene consensus sequences into the human genome draft 19 To compile a truly unique exonic index redundancies must also be resolved across transcript databases We grouped the databases into ranked categories and ordered them within categories Transcripts with known boundary information using the untranslated region database UTR DB 20 or full length cDNAs in the human transcript database HTDB 21 were given precedence over other records Consensus transcripts were given precedence over individual ESTs because they provide greatly improved specificity splicing evidence and transcript integrity We assembled UniGene based human 19 mouse and rat consensus transcripts Collectively the databases represent almost all public information on known genes transcripts and relevant homologous sequences When aligned segments overlapped only the segments from the highest ranked categories were retained After resolution of overlapping exons a new exonic index of contiguous spliced components was formed Each member of this new index inherited the rank of its highest ranked exon in order to facilitate subsequent identification of transcriptional units Our approach also ensures that known genes are represented only once in the final gene map Table 1describes the identification of exonic sequence via the public databases Not all human transcript records could be placed on the genome reflecting sequence gaps and the draft quality of the genomic clones The percentage placement of known genes 80 89 suggests that unsequenced regions will contribute substantial numbers of additional genes The varying placement percentages among transcript databases reflect varying sequence quality and differing transcript lengths Unique exons are those that have no overlap with those already placed by a higher ranked database Rodent transcripts provided a modest number of additional exons Finally additional placements were based on strong protein homology with supportive computer exon prediction The percent placement was relatively low because all proteins from different species were considered with specificity assured by using appropriately stringent criteria and exons confirmed by at least one gene prediction program When all of the databases are considered 613 183 unique exons were placed including 299 014 in complete open reading frames ORFs and 55 860 in partial ORFs The total putative exonic lengths add to 106 Mb or about 4 of the sequenced genome About 50 of our described exonic sequences are in ORFs Table 1 It is generally thought that the majority of exonic sequence is coding suggesting that additional coding sequences remain to be discovered This possible bias towards untranslated regions is to be expected as current transcript information is largely derived from the 3 or 5 termini of cDNA libraries At least 30 40 of the known genes or transcript indices contain one or more internal transcripts suggesting alternative splicing internal genes or occasional artifacts misassembly or genomic contamination The prevalence of alternative splicing remains unknown but may occur frequently 22 Sandwiched transcripts were merged with their flanking indices unless both the internal and the flanking sequences were from distinct known genes 150 apparent internal genes In addition we observed a small number of apparently overlapping exons about 530 on opposite strands 23 We assessed three ab initio gene prediction methods by comparing their predicted exons to the ones identified by transcripts and proteins Genscan Grail and Fgene were used across the genomic clones to identify potential exons Table 2 Approximately 70 of the 299 014 exons in ORFs with either transcript or protein support were identified by at least one of the programs but a very large number 847 283 of unconfirmed exons were also predicted The large apparent false negative and positive rates imply that pure computational gene prediction is not yet a practical alternative to experimental evidence Transcriptional units Our consolidated exonic index is of inherent biological interest but it is desirable to further identify transcriptional boundaries to create a putative gene index We used an approach designed to minimize fragmentation of exons and provide conservative gene counts see Materials and methods The following criteria were used to identify gene boundaries known 5 or 3 UTR sequences in UTR DB full length cDNAs in HTDB exons in partial ORFs as possible boundaries of coding regions exons without continuous ORFs as additional UTR sequences CpG islands and gene boundaries predicted by Genscan Multiple in frame exons in a continuous ORF were always considered part of a single gene an approach that tends to consolidate exons rather than create spurious additional genes Additional consolidation resulted from extension of boundaries for multiple exons not residing in ORFs until the occurrence of genomic landmarks described above The success of this approach depends largely on the extension and consolidation of overlapping transcripts and the integrity of ORFs and other genomic landmarks provided by the draft sequences Table 1lists the number of genes added by each database to the cumulative sum The total number of known genes in UTR DB HTDB and HINT is 16 673 This compares with 11 191 entries with at least partial functional annotation in UniGene May 2000 build and 11 863 entries in the HUGO Human Gene Nomenclature database 24 Approximately 48 of the transcriptional units were based on consensus transcripts and 28 based on individual ESTs A total of 9 372 transcriptional units were based on singleton transcripts without splicing evidence Single exon intronless genes occur with appreciable frequency in the human genome 25 At least one third of the singletons in our gene index contain intact ORFs and are predominantly histones G protein receptors olfactory receptors and cytokines or their homologs paralogs The remaining two thirds of the singletons do not have intact ORFs and possibly represent pseudogenes genomic contamination or other artifacts It is thought that most intronless genes originated from retrotranspositions of SINEs and LINEs 26 Thus the total number of single exon genes might be under represented in this study because of the repeat masking process necessary prior to our analysis This also applies to the tRNA rRNA and other snRNAs in the human genome which have been similarly masked A total of 1 437 units were supported only by rodent transcript consensus predominantly derived from cDNA libraries of early embryogenesis or tissues of the central nervous system An additional 3 154 units were identified on the basis of protein homology with exons supported by at least one gene prediction program Our approach yields an overall estimate of 75 982 transcriptional units with 66 610 supported by multiple transcripts or individual transcripts with splicing evidence Therefore the consolidation and integration of mainly the transcript information into the genomic consensus assures that our putative gene index is largely based on experimental evidence rather than ab initio gene prediction It is important to note that pseudogenes are common in the human genome and are thought to largely originate from gene duplication or retrotransposition 27 The extent to which pseudogenes remain transcriptionally active is still largely unknown however It is also difficult to identify pseudogenes computationally Although nonfunctional pseudogenes can have characteristic structural features some functional genes can also exhibit such features 27 We observed that 45 of the gene units were associated with CpG islands defined as 10 kb upstream or within the gene For the 6 500 known genes with known 5 boundaries the value was 40 The average genomic size of each of our transcriptional units from the first to last identified exon including only transcript or protein based exons is approximately 12 kb The overall average gene length is likely to be significantly longer but full length cDNA information is not yet available for most genes Comparison of gene counts Our count of 66 000 75 000 transcriptional units on the genome is consistent with gene count estimates 28 29 that had held sway until recent widely varying estimates 17 30 31 Ewing and Green 17 examined 680 assumed genes on chromosome 22 and found matches to 2 of a selected set of assembled EST contigs The sampling approach assumes that the 680 genes represent 2 of all genes resulting in an overall count of 34 000 An examination of evolutionarily conserved regions in known genes on chromosome 22 in humans compared to the fish Tetraodon nigroviridis 30 results in an estimate of around 30 000 genes assuming a uniform rate of conserved regions per true gene These approaches resulted in similar estimates when applied to larger sets of mRNAs or known genes and are similar to the current 33 000 genes reported by Ensembl as having Genscan computational support and EST confirmation All of these estimates are carefully constructed and remarkably concordant and we propose possible explanations for the difference from our results The differences do not result entirely from the reliance on transcriptional evidence as has been proposed 32 Our estimate of 854 genes on chromosome 22 is 25 greater than that of Ewing and Green 17 but represents only 1 4 rather than 2 of our gene total It was noted 17 that high gene expression on chromosome 22 could result in low gene count estimates by biasing the reference sample In addition known genes may be more highly expressed than unknown genes which presumably aided their initial identification and characterization Our evaluation of EST evidence supports the existence of both forms of bias We have found that 5 of Ewing and Green s original set of EST contigs selected with less stringent criteria than those used to estimate gene counts map to chromosome 22 An examination of UniGene transcripts May 2000 reveals that the known genes contain a median of 41 entries whereas anonymous transcripts contain a median of just two entries This is not entirely explained by the greater length of the known gene like transcripts having been correctly assembled as a single unit In dividing the number of ESTs in the consensus by its length we obtain a median of 0 017 entries per base pair for known genes and 0 005 entries per base pair for anonymous transcripts On chromosome 22 the median number of ESTs per anonymous transcript is three which is significantly higher than that among other transcripts on the genome geometric mean 3 76 versus 3 11 for other chromosomes p 0 0001 Wilcoxon rank sum test The estimate based on conserved regions 30 is calibrated using known genes This approach also introduces bias as such genes appear more likely to belong to the evolutionary core proteome Known genes comprise 22 of all of our transcriptional units but comprise 71 of our units which are conserved with rodents Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans A recent high gene estimate based on transcript evidence 31 again using chromosome 22 appears to result from less stringent alignment criteria resulting in many putative genes As genomic annotation proceeds the number of protein coding genes will become clearer Our approach seems to rule out artifactual or genomic contamination as the predominant explanation for transcriptional units with unknown function or protein homology Ensembl has recently listed a count of 170 160 confirmed exons whereas we report 299 014 in complete ORFs and many more in untranslated regions suggesting that our approach identifies considerable additional transcription We point out that only 58 of known genes exhibit protein homology Table 1 and for example a large proportion of transcriptional units have not been functionally classified in Drosophila 4 We therefore propose that most of the unclassified transcriptional units are in fact coding the lack of protein homology may reflect difficulty in studying these proteins or rapid gene evolution and some portion is likely to function at the RNA level 33 Gene map The placement of transcriptional units is not without error as most genomic clones are unfinished and the restriction fingerprint map can be subject to misassembly To resolve placement errors we used a relational database to integrate information from several independent maps including Genemap 99 assembled genomic contigs and fingerprint radiation hybrid and cytogenetic maps see Materials and methods Placement required a minimum of three concordant criteria Together a total of 75 982 transcriptional units were placed on the genome providing an initial glimpse of a complete gene map The mapand associated functional annotationare available as additional data files Functional annotation SWISS PROT TrEMBL PIR Protein Information Resource and Pfam Protein Families database were used to annotate our unified gene index because functional keywords in these databases are standardized 34 Table 3 We used the classification schema developed by the International Gene Ontology Consortium to assign each keyword to an appropriate ontological description 35 and see additional data files for keyword assignments When more than one unrelated protein was identified within one gene unit clear functional roles and biological processes were given priority over other keyword designations Similarly protein based annotation was performed for HINT consensus transcripts The transcriptional units resulted in a greater number of annotations around 23 000 than HINT transcripts around 11 000 because of the increased length of exonic sequences from other transcript databases and the included genomic sequence It is also important to note at least 12 000 of the gene units had more than one conserved protein domain as evidenced by Pfam hits Additional functional repertoire and biological complexity might be derived from shuffling and other recombinant events of individual exons during genome evolution The annotation also allows us to assess the protein composition of human versus other species A BlastX result of E 10 20was required in cross species DNA protein alignments to be considered homologous A total of 20 892 human transcriptional units 30 of all units are homologous with at least one other species 5 792 10 were conserved across mammals mouse or rat Drosophila and C elegans A total of 1 759 3 were conserved across all of these species and yeast These values are very consistent with a recent comparative genomic survey 36 Global tissue expression profiles During the assembly o UniGene 19 we retained the library source for each EST via links provided by UniGene to the IMAGE consortium 37 Most of the 2 500 libraries comprising UniGene ESTs were derived from single tissues or embryonic stages and we further standardized the library source annotation into 102 categories Keywords and derived categories are available as additional data files The most highly represented categories were various types of tumors 15 0 of all ESTs fetal tissue 10 7 embryo 6 2 infant 5 1 and testis 4 3 We reasoned that some genes might exhibit highly tissue specific expression such that most of the ESTs comprising a transcript would be derived from the tissue The identified genes are potential candidates for diseases of the involved tissues Similar approaches have been used to identify candidate genes for pathologies of the prostate 38 and retina 39 We explore here the global nature of tissue source specificity The result was 7 459 HINT transcripts with highly significant tissue specificity 11 Many of these are known genes and an examination of the most specific transcripts revealed clear relationships to the associated tissue For example a search for retina specific genes revealed that the ten most significantly associated with retina include five known genes all related to retina function Four are implicated in retina pathology GNAT1 and ARR night blindness RHO retinitis pigmentosa and GUCA1A cone dystrophy Similar results were observed in numerous other tissues although not as obviously related to pathology The results appear especially striking for tissues with substantial EST representation including brain lung liver kidney and testis suggesting that putative tissue involvement can be inferred for many anonymous ESTs Where possible the tissue expression profile has been incorporated into the annotation of our gene index Approximately half 50 5 of the tissue specific clusters were from embryonic tissue libraries while such tissue contributed 6 2 of all UniGene ESTs This striking result is consistent with the highly regulated and specific nature of embryonic development 40 The embryo category is followed by brain 9 7 brain specific versus 3 8 of ESTs in number of tissue specific clusters kidney 5 5 versus 3 5 and testis 6 1 versus 4 3 We also examined the locations of the tissue specific transcripts on the genome and found no evidence of regional clustering see description of regional functional clustering in Materials and methods A global view of the human genome In keeping with the long standing clinical importance of cytogenetics it is important to align Giemsa staining G dark cytobands versus R pale bands ISCN 1995 to the assembly 41 Cytoband boundaries on genomic sequence have been depicted with apparent precision 13 42 but in fact are largely unknown With only a few fold genomic coverage the gap sizes in unfinished sequence are difficult to estimate precisely Thus it is preferable to align the cytoband positions to the fixed assembly rather than the reverse Such an assembly corrected alignment was performed using genes ESTs that have been mapped cytogenetically and also placed on the assembly This alignment is approximate as the resolution of conventional staining techniques and fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH is limited to 1 3 Mb 43 Density of genomic features The resulting corrected ideograms and six major genomic features are plotted across the genome in Figure 1 Unique exons as determined above CpG islands genomic GC content Alu and LINE1 elements and minisatellites are plotted as densities proportion of bases belonging to feature in 1 Mb intervals The assembly corrected ideogram clearly differs from the standard ideogram for example in our representation ip is longer than 1q This may reflect more complete sequencing on 1p or perhaps differing DNA packing densities on the two chromosome arms Many of the chromosomes show a suggestive relationship between cytobands and exon density consistent with the expectation that R bands are relatively gene rich A more striking result is the expected positive correlation among exons CpG islands GC content and minisatellites which track each other closely on most chromosomes Exon density is relatively high on chromosomes known to be gene rich for example 17 and 19 44 and low on chromosomes 4 13 X and Y A total of 48 000 CpG islands were found on the assembly using standard criteria 45 see Figure 1legend with a median length of 336 bp As sequencing gaps are filled this number may increase Considering the varying definitions of CpG islands especially the minimum length of CpG rich region this number is in close agreement with the estimate of 45 000 obtained by Antequera and Bird 28 using methylation sensitive restriction enzymes The CpG island density is also in agreement with a report of FISH karyotypes using CpG island probes 46 with contrasting fluorescent signal in late replicating regions Extended regions of high CpG island density such as the terminus of 1p and 1q21 q22 are apparent in the FISH assay Short spikes of CpG islands for example in 3p26 and 3p25 of Figure 1 do not obviously appear in the assay perhaps because they are below the resolution of FISH or are part of transcriptionally active regions In contrast to exon and CpG island density GC content shows limited variation in the range 35 55 for most 1 Mb intervals The overall GC content is 41 1 This compares with estimates in the range of 40 41 based on density gradient centrifugation 47 and flow cytometry 48 Consistent with previous reports 49 Alu repeats show an apparent positive correlation with exon CpG and GC densities while LINE1 densities do not show such correlation Approximately 1 1 million Alu repeats were identified as expected 50 However a total of 758 000 LINE1 repeats were identified 40 higher than estimates based on a sampling of sequenced regions 50 Minisatellites of the hypervariable family 20 50 bp repeat size are dispersed throughout the genome but as expected 51 show sharp spikes in subtelomeric regions of most chromosomes Comparison of cytogenetic bands We next examined the overall correspondence between cytobands and exonic density and other genomic features Table 4gives the average densities of features in the R bands versus G bands based on the assembly corrected alignment Genomic intervals residing in R bands were significantly richer in exons CpG islands GC content Alu repeats and minisatellites than those in G bands The reverse is true for LINE1 elements These observations accord with predictions based on a variety of indirect methods 52 or a selected set of genes 53 but only now can be investigated directly using the sequence of the entire genome The increased exonic density in R bands was fairly modest approximately 30 and may reflect attenuation due to alignment error In addition the analysis did not account for variation in staining intensity in G bands 41 The results across the chromosomes were fairly consistent however and the R G exonic density ratio exceeded 2 0 on two chromosomes 13 and 21 and was below 1 0 on only one chromosome Y The increased density of CpG islands in R bands was more striking 59 whereas GC content was only a few percent higher 42 2 versus 39 8 in G bands again consistent with previous observations 54 The results for the cytobands are also reflected in pairwise correlations of the genomic features across 1 Mb intervals These correlations do not depend on the cytoband alignment and most features were positively correlated LINE1 elements again differed from other features showing a negative correlation with exons CpG islands GC content and Alu repeats Gene density We analyzed the exonic sequence for each chromosome as given in Table 1 Figure 2ashows the density of exonic sequence per chromosome Chromosomes 19 and 17 are the richest that is densest in exonic sequence 44 by factors of 2 04 and 1 62 respectively compared to the average for the genome Chromosomes 4 13 21 X and Y are exon poor A similar pattern emerges in the density of transcriptional units across the chromosomes as shown in Figure 2b 19 Reports based on integrated radiation hybrid RH maps of ESTs 55 56 indicated that chromosomes 1 and 22 were more gene rich but otherwise broadly agree with our results An intriguing clinical observation follows from these data and the tissue specific observations It had been noted 52 that the aneuploidies that are compatible with survival until birth trisomies 13 18 and 21 as well as X and Y aneuploidy appeared to occur in relatively gene poor chromosomes Our data confirm these observations However the most obvious models for the deleterious effects of aneuploidy should instead depend on the total number of genes In examining our HINT transcripts we have found that in fact the total number of embryo specific transcripts is lowest on these five chromosomes Figure 3 We suggest that trisomy of other chromosomes may exceed a limit of survivable dosage compensation during development Comparisons to genetic and radiation hybrid maps A total of 3 628 Genethon markers from the Marshfield map were localized via e PCR 57 on the assembly along with 28 350 Genebridge 4 markers ESTs and 4 688 Stanford G3 markers appearing in Genemap 99 Figure 4shows the positions of markers on the Chromosome 1 assembly The curves are nearly monotonically increasing showing that the assembly is broadly correct although localized orientation errors and outliers remain see additional data files for plots for all chromosomes These plots are immediately useful as they enable the placement of new markers on genetic maps without the need for mapping experiments Some of the variation is likely to reflect estimation error in the published maps and the curves are not completely monotonic for finished chromosomes 21 and 22 However other regions are likely to reflect errors in assembly as the genetic and RH maps agree with each other but disagree with the assembly for example the 130 148 Mb region is reversed on chromosome 5 a 15 Mb region of Xqter belongs at Xpter numerous other isolated reversals and extensive reversals appear on chromosome 16 The genetic map shows a higher recombination rate per unit physical distance that is higher slope at the telomeres and a low male recombination rate and thus sex averaged rate near the centromere approximately 130 Mb Similar patterns hold for the entire genome These observations agree with previous studies which had been limited to comparisons of genetic and RH maps 58 male female meiotic ratios 59 or relatively few markers on well sequenced chromosomes 59 The plots offer an interesting perspective on positional cloning efforts For example examination of the plots reveals that the hemochromatosis gene HFE at 28 Mb on 6p lies at the edge of a recombination cold spot from 28 40 Mb This fact complicated efforts to map the gene via linkage disequilibrium 60 In contrast the NIDDM1 gene at 2qter a region with higher recombination rate was initially mapped to a 7 centimorgan cM region which fortunately was discovered to be only 1 7 Mb of sequence 61 The radiation hybrid plots tend to be more linear which is consistent with the model that radiation induces chromosomal breakpoints essentially uniformly 62 However jumps in the Genebridge 4 GB4 map occur at the centromere on most chromosomes This may result from incomplete centromeric sequencing and assembly so that a large centromeric gap might not appear as such Alternatively the jumps may reflect statistical difficulties in estimating break point rates across the centromere We note that no jump occurs in the G3 map apparently because the higher radiation intensity produces insufficient marker pairs in the rescued hybrids that span the centromere Thus the jump cannot be accurately estimated and was simply suppressed in the published map 63 The GB4 jump is strikingly large on several chromosomes and we propose that the jumps might reflect increased radiation sensitivity at the centromere This hypothesis is worth additional investigation Clusters and compartments The availability of the full assembly enables a comparison of the entire genome to itself for evidence of homology arising from duplications or insertions We emphasize that the genome is still in draft form and a complete description of these features will be a large and ongoing scientific and computational task We used BlastN 64 to identify intrachromosomal homology and to provide an initial look at the genomic landscape Local duplication is a feature common to all chromosomes as evidenced by the near diagonal runs in dot matrix plots in which the line of complete identity has been removed Figure 5 and see additional data files for full page plots for each chromosome These runs vary across the chromosomes and tend to be of high sequence identity indicative of recent origin More distant duplications also occur and include large repetitive regions of high identity on chromosomes 10 and 17 The Y chromosome shows strong internal sequence similarity some of which arises from strikingly long duplications from several of the order of 100 kb to a duplication of almost 1 Mb near the q terminus of the euchromatic region Near duplicate sequences appear throughout the genome producing a plaid appearance on many chromosomes These sequences tend to have lower sequence similarity blue in Figure 5 consistent with an ancient origin and accumulated mutations As an example of functional duplication we note that more than 60 of the entire zinc finger ZNF families are mapped to chromosome 19 restricted to six large tandemly duplicated gene clusters spanning the chromosome More than one type of ZNF is found within each cluster presumably as a result of sequence divergence A majority of these ZNFs densely populate the 22 27 Mb region see Figure 5 The remaining ZNFs are mapped to 15q21 bZIP 7q11 KRAB 11q13 C 3 HC 4 11q23 C 3 HC 4 6p21 C 2 H 2 1op11 KRAB 1oq11 C 2 H 2 16p11 C 2 H 2 9q22 C 2 H 2 and 3p21 C 2 H 2 The largest functional group is related to phosphoryl transfer and protein kinases Interestingly many of the biological functions involving phosphoryl transfer form large gene clusters as well For example the mitogen activated protein kinase family phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate 5 kinase family protein kinase C family and at least 55 other diverse protein kinases are distributed in five gene clusters on chromosome 1 only about one third of which have been previously described Similar gene clusters are also found on chromosomes 2 3 6 19 22 and X In addition DNA repair genes form gene clusters on different chromosomes with postmeiotic segregation proteins PMS on chromosome 7 glycosidases on chromosome 12 MutS homologs on chromosome 6 MutT homologs on chromosome X MutL homologs on chromosome 2 Rad1 Rec1 Rad7 homologs on chromosome 10 excision repair on chromosome 11 and repair for single strand nicks on chromosome 19 Additional regions of high and striking sequence similarity and the list of matching sequences with protein homology are provided in the additional data files Paralogous genes resulting from recent gene duplication might preserve the same functionality and regulatory apparatus as their progenitors We used chromosome 19 as the model to test this hypothesis by comparing the cDNA library profiles of spatially adjacent paralogous genes At least one of the ZNF clusters 22 27 Mb region Figure 5 appears to be more recent than the remaining clusters on the same chromosome 80 sequence identity Intriguingly two distinct tissue library profiles were scored for a total of 38 mapped ZNF paralogs with the telomeric portion of the cluster predominantly expressed in germ cells 589 622 ESTs The remaining members of the cluster were primarily expressed in embryos 9 19 weeks of age 145 167 ESTs The same phenomenon did not hold for the ZNF clusters where sequence similarity is lower We were motivated to find additional paralogous genes with their regulation similarly preserved We mapped gene indices on duplicated genomic sequences Alcohol dehydrogenases 1 2 3 4 5 and 7 are tandemly duplicated on 4q21 with their transcripts consistently being over represented in embryonic and fetal cDNA libraries Similar observations were obtained for other gene clusters including amylases on 1p21 annexins on 4q21 homeobox proteins on 7p15 and 17q21 metallothioneins on 16q13 crystalline proteins on 2q33 glutathione S transferases m1 m2 m3 m4 and m5 on 1p13 histone families H2A H2B H3 H4 on 6p21 killer cell lectin like receptors on 12p13 proline rich proteins on 12p13 protocadherins on 5p15 s100 calcium binding proteins on 1q21 keratins on 17q12 ADP ribosylation factors 3 4 and 5 on 10q22 and the major histocompatibility complex on 6p21 Together these observations strongly support the notion that much of the regional clustering of functionally related proteins originates from gene duplication Clustering of ontological groups We also examined the locations of all transcriptional units that had been classified according to a gene ontology derived schema Table 3 and see Materials and methods for evidence of regional clustering of functionally related proteins We applied a test that corrected for regional gene density and found substantial evidence for regional clustering among the transcripts belonging to the same category see additional data files for location plotsfor the top 60 ontological categories Such clustering is pervasive much of it is likely to have arisen from duplication in which functional units have been preserved As an additional demonstration of the duplication phenomenon we considered the occurrence of Pfam motifs within ORFs with only the best Pfam match retained per ORF around 1 930 of the 2 011 Pfam categories were represented Matching successive runs of four or more that occur at least three times on the genome appear in the additional data files Many of the runs occur on the near diagonal Most involve four identical Pfam categories in succession or a double run of two categories again pointing to local duplication We also examined the runs of six or more gene units in which the ontological classifications occur in the same order or the reverse in multiple locations on the genome A dot matrix plotacross the genome appears in the additional data files The plot shows clear evidence of local duplication while the distant matches even across chromosomes are under investigation in the context of the complete sequence We have noticed interesting associations among membrane proteins ion channels electron transporters ATP binding cassettes and genes involving metabolism on chromosomes 2 5 and 7 Proximity may be important for regulating functionally coupled genes and intriguing observations of this phenomenon are well established in prokaryotic organisms 65 and recently reported in yeast 66 We are investigating the possibility that at least some of the positional functional coupling may be due to regulated mechanisms other than gene duplication Conclusions The human genome is a capacious resource that will support years of intensive investigation The quality of the draft sequence has now reached the point that genetic maps can truly be integrated into the genome Analysis at the sequence level shows pervasive local and distant duplication much of which preserves function We have found evidence for a large number of transcriptional units 65 000 75 000 and performed initial annotation and classification The effective study of transcription and protein function requires the compilation of all available evidence of transcription and protein homology Since the initial submission of this manuscript two reports have appeared 67 68 in which the human genome is analyzed and described The raw genomic sequence used for the present study was generated by the Human Genome Consortium HGC and is principally the same as that used in their report 67 In our effort we have benefited from early release and open data policies adopted by the consortium The three reports offer insights into varying aspects of the genome In our report we have emphasized the compilation of all available transcriptional evidence and have made observations of functional positional clustering of genes and global tissue specificity that will provide the basis for in depth investigation The other reports have arrived at estimates of approximately 30 000 genes in the genome and the ensuing attention leaves the unfortunate impression that genomic analysis consists primarily of gene counting While our estimate of 65 000 75 000 transcriptional units clearly differs from these estimates it is useful to consider that there is much independent agreement in the reports We have placed around 15 000 known genes in the genome and described 33 000 that have substantial homology to the major protein databases These figures are very comparable to the known and confirmed genes respectively placed on the sequence by Celera Genomics and HGC The Celera and HGC reports rely on a combination of computational gene prediction and transcriptional evidence to identify genes in a manner that may be highly conservative Our approach to identifying genes and exons is more heavily transcript based with the presumption that pure computational gene prediction may still have substantial false negative rates In applying this approach we find experimental evidence for many novel exons with clear splicing evidence on the order of twice as many as described in the other reports This fact largely explains our greater number of transcriptional units as our mean number of exons per transcriptional unit 613 183 759 822 8 07 is very comparable to the Celera and HGC reports We hold that the reliance on ab initio approaches presents difficulties as known genes may be more highly expressed and may present a biased sample for calibration Another difference in the approaches is that we have used pre assembled consensus transcripts whenever possible in alignment to the genome The use of such consensus sequences is likely to improve alignment increase splicing evidence and has been shown to improve the detection of protein homology 19 We propose that the remaining 32 000 42 000 units we have identified will represent a useful resource for additional investigation as genomic annotation proceeds A comparison of all three approaches will surely yield new insights Materials and methods Exon identification The 26 June 2000 version of the repeat masked draft sequences was downloaded from the Ensembl Genome Server 69 and blasted against cDNA and protein sequences by using the Blast program compiled from the NCBI toolkit 6 1 on a 32 node SGI Linux Intel Cluster with four 550 MHz Pentium III Xeon processors and 2 GB of RAM on each node The following databases were used Human UTR DB EBI version 13 70 Human Transcript Database Baylor University version 1 71 GenBank CDS NCBI only PRI mRNA sequences were used version 119 72 HINT Ohio State University 73 EST Assembly Project University of Washington 74 TIGR Human Gene Index version 4 5 75 dbEST NCBI version 119 76 MINT and RINT Ohio State University 73 EMBL Rodent EMBL version 63 77 SWISS PROT EMBL version 39 78 TrEMBL EMBL version 14 78 PIR MIPS JIPID version 65 79 and Pfam Sanger Centre version 5 4 80 Gene prediction programs used are described in Table 2 The Mouse and Rat Indices of Non redundant Transcripts MINT and RINT were derived from Mouse and Rat UniGene 81 using the same approach that we have applied to human UniGene 19 Briefly chimeric sequences were removed UniGene transcripts were assembled into sequence contigs and links to progenitor records retained The genome wide hit expectation value was set at E 10 25 BlastN or E 10 15 BlastX to filter out nonspecific high scoring segment pairs HSPs Default parameters of Blast were used The Blast report was parsed into field specific tables using the program MSPcrunch Version 2 3 82 The resulting table was processed using a set of Perl scripts by first retaining only the HSPs that were spliced from the same transcripts on the same genomic contig The same process was then applied to the HSPs on the genomic sequences Spliced HSPs from the same transcripts were retained followed by the singleton HSPs that were both longer and higher in sequence identity over their overlapping counterparts resulting in a unique placement for each cDNA segment on the genomic sequence Prediction of transcriptional units A set of Perl scripts was used to implement the algorithm described below Genomic clones were ordered and oriented using the fingerprint map and draft assembly Within unfinished clones sequence contigs were further ordered and oriented according to Ensembl s assembly 83 This mapping produced the positional context necessary for consolidating fragmented exon units Where necessary small sequencing gaps 100 bp or fewer were ignored and genomic clones were considered contiguous except where a large gap was indicated in the draft assembly 50 kb ORFs were determined using the program getorf 84 The exon index is an integrated table generated by a Sybase relational database consisting of chromosome number fingerprinted contig FPC ID FPC contig order BAC contig ID BAC contig order BAC contig orientation starting position of exon on BAC contig end position of exon on BAC contig exon orientation transcript orientation available from GenBank IMAGE UniGene HINT and dbEST evidence transcript protein gene prediction ORF Pfam database name Table 1 feature poly A signal CpG island Genscan boundary starting position on exon or feature end position on exon or feature score BlastN BlastX The index was first ordered and oriented for the individual BAC contigs according to Ensembl or UCSC 85 maps The resulting contigs were then ordered and oriented according to the FPC order and orientation information in the UCSC genome assembly resulting in a numeric sorting order for all the individual contigs In addition large gap information 50 kb available from the UCSC assembly was incorporated into the same index where no overlapping information was available between presumably adjacent BACs The consolidation algorithm follows a hierarchy in which unit boundaries are respected for the highest ranking feature The features in descending ranking were UTRs based on known UTR indices exons containing no ORFs or incomplete ORFs boundaries of known full length cDNAs HTDB based indices EST orientation information 5 or 3 origin from the original IMAGE UniGene HINT and dbEST databases and Genscan predicted poly A signals When clear boundary indicators were not available information from the transcript indices HINT assembled from UniGene 19 and EG 17 were used directly as secondary evidence for potential gene boundaries The rationale is that each UniGene cluster has at least one known gene or two sets of ESTs representing both the 5 and 3 termini of a gene or at least one EST containing a poly A signal 81 Similar stringent criteria were used in Ewing and Green s EST assemblies 17 Multiple exons not residing in intact ORFs were consolidated until the occurrence of exons in a partial or complete ORF Multiple in frame exons in a continuous ORF were always considered part of a single gene To prevent any overconsolidation as a result of lack of transitional exons in partial or complete ORFs for adjacent genes CpG islands large gaps 50 kb between exons and Genscan prediction were used as gene boundaries when higher ranking boundary information was unavailable In such instances HINT and EG index identity was respected Although a variety of criteria were used for determining transcriptional unit boundaries the vast majority of the consolidation was achieved on the basis of terminal information from gene indices and transition and continuation of open reading frames Gene mapping A relational database was used to integrate multiple largely independent maps for the genomic clones where transcripts had been placed This integration thus results in a transcript map based on the order and position of genomic clones Individual sequencing contigs within each unfinished clone were oriented using the Ensembl contig map 83 The fingerprint see 8 version 15 June 2000 GoldenPath assembly Versions 15 June and 5 September 2000 and radiation hybrid maps 86 were used to place genomic clones into their chromosomal context As a substantial number of the clones in the working draft had not been physically typed with RH or genetic markers the program e PCR 48 and primers collected in the RHdb 87 and Genethon 88 were used under stringent criteria mismatch o margin 50 and word size 7 Genetic mapping information was obtained from the Marshfield map 89 In addition Genemap 99 for cDNA was integrated into the genomic clones harboring HINT consensus transcripts For the HINT consensus with more than one mapped EST an averaged RH position was used Cytogenetic bands were inherited from the original UniGene database Furthermore we incorporated a weighted composite quality score for the following four maps Genemap 99 the number of consistently mapped ESTs and their associated genomic clones e PCR the number of consistently mapped sequence tagged sites STSs in a genomic clone FPC the supporting evidence in the original database Blast evidence of splicing On the basis of such an integrated database schema mapping information from sequence clone contigs radiation hybrid and cytogenetic positions for a given transcript could be obtained through a SQL Structured Query Language join statement Tissue specific transcripts We noted the total number of ESTs contributed by each tissue to compute an expected proportion For each HINT consensus transcript we identified the tissue source contributing the most ESTs to the consensus The expected binomial distribution for the fixed number of ESTs in the consensus was used to compute a p value which was then Bonferroni corrected for the 81 tissues 67 000 HINT consensus transcripts Cytoband alignment G bands are known to be relatively AT rich but the precise relationship between sequence and cytoband position is too poorly understood to be used for alignment Genes ESTs with cytoband position appearing in UniGene were placed on the full genome assembly Cytoband cutpoints were used to create a scatterplot with the center of the cytoband forming the x coordinate and assembly position as the y coordinate Outliers were identified as points lying more than 2 5 standard errors outside of prediction intervals from a third degree polynomial regression fit A Loess regression fit was used on the remaining points to estimate cytoband boundaries with p and q arms fitted separately Centromeres and heterochromatic regions were assumed not sequenced on the basis of a review of current clone frameworks Primary sources for assignments of genes to heterochromatic regions were examined and in most cases deemed inconclusive An exception is chromosome 19 which has a considerable number of genes assigned to 19q12 and finished sequence in the region Scatterplots and regression fits for the entire genome are in the additional data files Genomic feature correlations All 1 Mb intervals were combined to produce Table 4 but statistical tests were performed by computing ratios and correlations within each chromosome separately in order to account for correlation of features within each chromosome These statistics were then compared across the chromosomes to an appropriate null value using single sample t tests Some of the features were skewed and pairwise comparisons were performed using Spearman rank correlations A Bonferroni multiple comparison procedure was applied to the 15 unique correlations Regional functional clustering Apparently significant clustering can arise from the fact that genes exhibit regional clustering To correct for this we considered the physical order of all mapped transcripts and calculated the distances in ranked location between transcripts belonging to the same ontological category Under the null hypothesis the transcripts in a category should be distributed uniformly among all mapped transcripts with ontological classification and the successive distances are approximately truncated exponential On this basis we compared the observed tenth percentile of successive distances to that under the null hypothesis to compute a p value All tests were highly significant with p 0 0001 for 59 of the 60 largest categories and quantile quantile plots with observed versus expected distributions showed striking evidence of clustering These tests were confirmed with permutation tests with empirical generations under the null hypothesis As a conservative correction for the possibility that separate transcriptional units might belong to the same gene we considered successive distances for every other transcript These tests were also significant with p 0 01 for the 60 categories Additional data files Additional data files are available online as follows transcriptional units computational prediction FPC e PCR RH and assembly maps functional annotation tissue
