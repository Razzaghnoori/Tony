                okay we have uh we have a family reunion every every summer and uh we different uh sides of the family take turns on planning it sending out the invitations and and then uh the activities that we have we kind of get together and have a luncheon or a lunch or a a cookout or barbecue or whatever and uh and get to know so all the cousins get to know each other and we really enjoy our our family uh get togethers and family reunions so to speak are you able to do that   yes we have ours every three years and uh we have uh relatives in Mexico and Brownsville Texas and Pennsylvania Ohio um   oh okay   West Virginia Virginia and Florida so weve got them everywhere New Jersey and thats why we only have one every three years so that everybody can get together and we uh have one from early morning it starts at eleven   oh wow umhum   and it goes all day and we just had one a year and a half ago we have it every summer in a place called Bare Rocks   umhum   its a  it was a a resort and it was catered and um i hadnt seen cousins that i hadnt seen for years and others that are new in the family from marriage or   well thats really great and uh theyre able to come from long distances like that we we have children in Ohio and uh Texas and Germany and Illinois and uh all over but uh they get to some of them but this is uh the ones that live in Utah and but it its sure great uh those family reunions are really something but   umhum arent they wonderful   at uh   uh its a shame that people cant get together like that more often and and uh have a close family tie   it really is because that that really helps and like say to get to know each other and the background and we uh we the one that we have every year uh we go up to uh go up into the canyon and camp out for uh over the weekend and uh it we   uhhuh   have a bonfire and uh sit around and in the evening and uh around the pine trees in the pine trees in the mountains and uh   yeah   the atmospheres just really nice and then the kids get to play with each other and it uh its a super thing uh   that sounds like fun we only have ours for that one day and uh   umhum   then we make plans whos going to have the next one where its going to be and all that and the next one i believe is going to be in New Jersey next year   uhhuh   so um do you have a large family   uh we have uh theres probably about uh our own own family there is we had six children but we have uh my wifes side of the family is the one that we go up to uh Idaho up in the canyon and uh theres probably about uh forty people there and uh total and then we do have another get together at Christmas time on my side of the family and uh this last one we had eighty five people to that one   uhhuh well thats good how many was in your family   uh we have uh i had five uh four brothers and one sister and then on my wifes side of the family she had uh four sisters and uh a brother   uhhuh   and so were kind of from large families and then theyre all married and all have their children and they come and uh so its its really quite a get together weve been doing this uh up in Idaho in the summer in the camp out for uh were thirty nine years every summer weve done this and we do it the second week in July between the Fourth of July and the twenty fourth of July which is a holiday here in Utah   umhum whats the holiday   its uh when the pioneers came into Utah and settled uh Utah Brigham Young came in on the twenty fourth of July   oh   and when they came across they came from the east in the covered wagons and uh settled or started the settlement of Salt Lake City so   is there a special uh type of festivities for that occasion too   yeah uh they have uh we have uh a large parade in Salt Lake City its probably the one of the biggest parades in the country it goes for about three or four hours   um   and uh of course uh its a state holiday and so we uh we have ours between that and uh the week between those the fourth and twenty fourth and so every year we know
