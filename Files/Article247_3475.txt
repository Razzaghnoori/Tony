 Culturebox s Fall Preview As ahead of itself as the presidential campaign fall preview season is upon us From now until mid September Time Newsweek the New York Times and half the other magazines and newspapers in the country will participate in that odd journalistic ritual whereby critics abandon the skepticism we demand of them the rest of the year and emit hopeful bubbles of enthusiasm a gush that turns to bile when the plays or movies or art shows in question prove as disappointing as one sort of suspected they would be Under researched and perfunctory no editor or reporter wants this unrewarding time consuming assignment tending toward hyperbole once a writer has picked things to preview he has to justify his choices previews nonetheless provide a valuable service You read the pix you buy your tix and you re cocktail party proofed for the season The only problem is that not everybody goes to cocktail parties or even longs to be up on the latest thing What about those of us who consume culture on the fly who go to the movies only when dragged to the megaplex by the kids who buy books at airport bookstores who need to know whether the Broadway show whose high priced tickets our parents are trying to pawn off on us is a gaudy spectacle from hell or Great Art We don t want long lists of everything we know we should see but never will We want the opposite a list of everything we must absolutely not see under any circumstances if it were the only show playing in the godforsaken town where we d gone for a stint in an isolation tank and you get the idea To this end Culturebox hereby inaugurates the Culturebox Anti Fall Preview an admittedly unscientific list of the musts to avoid in this fall s cinematic literary theatrical and sartorial seasons Just because it s unscientific doesn t mean it won t be empirical Though Culturebox lacks a vast staff of underlings to read watch listen and try on the latest size 2 fashions for her she will rely on you dear readers for data Tell her what on the fall preview lists about to inundate us you ve actually read or seen or worked on the set of or worn or gotten some serious inside dope on and know for a fact to be a complete and utter dud For instance This week Entertainment Weekly kicks off its fall preview with a two and a quarter page spread on Kevin Costner in For the Love of the Game Having failed to win critics hearts with his last two movies The Postman and Message in a Bottle Costner is presumably reverting to the most consistently successful formula of his career charming over the hill sports figure makes a comeback Now this may be a masterly work of cinematic innovation defying her own demand for empirical evidence Culturebox speaks on the basis neither of a preview screening nor of gossip She just has this hunch that For The Love of the Game will turn out to be a pitch Bull Durham meets Tin Cup that mistakenly found its way to film You make the call His team s in last place He s just found out he s about to get traded And the love of his life is about to leave him With all of this bad news he steps onto the mound at Yankee Stadium and over the course of what turns out to be a perfect game he flashes back on his life and replays its pivotal moments Popcorn anyone
