 i Magnolia i Goes to 11 and Beyond Roger I loved your piece on this new film technology you write about the subject with infectious excitement And you got to go to San Luis Obispo But I wondered why you didn t dwell in that piece on what for me is the most salient fact of digital filmmaking not so much the means of exhibition as the means of production As you ve pointed out in your entry above what thrills filmmakers is that shooting on digital video is like a thousand times cheaper than shooting on 35 mm or even 16 mm We all know that in low budget films it s not the actors that are your greatest expense it s the film stock David O Russell made his great Spanking The Monkey on short ends snatched up by his wife Janet Grillo then a New Line executive Digital will be the great equalizer You shoot as much footage as you like and you don t have to convert it all to telecines it s computer ready Any fancy effect you do in the editing wipes dissolves superimpositions won t have to be transferred to film which is what costs a fortune The kind of arduous catch as catch can process that Mark Borchardt goes through in American Movie will be a thing of the past Most filmmakers don t care if digital projection looks better than celluloid they d be thrilled if it looked as good As to the question of perception it s fascinating mind blowing In Michael Almereyda s Sundance documentary of a few years back Atom Egoyan ruminates on the distinctions between film and video on the fact that film goes at 24 frames a second and that a lot of what you re looking at is blank space and flicker There s a distinct difference in his films between the video state and the film state Can video approximate the effect of film Maybe not but if there s a way to simulate a digital equivalent George Lucas will finance it One more question What is the distinction is between hypnosis and reverie It sounds like mystical poetry to me I think it s great that anyone will be able to do what Harmony Korine does since what he does he does so badly We really disagree on Julien Donkey Boy It can be exciting when directors and actors are willing to put themselves on the line like that but Korine just pummels you with the same idea over and over He isn t trying to capture reality he s trying to rub your nose in it And underneath he has the same huckster s mentality as Roger Corman or even H G Lewis He throws in a bloody dead baby to get your attention As for the idea that the movie mimics the perceptions of a delusional schizophrenic it s hardly in the other the other the other shut up I say shut up Not not not the loser of the egg that s not a mountain you fool that s a hill my screen my screen is flashes on and off and on and off and yarrrggghhhhh See I can do it too Magnolia is Six Actors in Search of an Oscar Make that Twelve Actors Any bit could be taken out of context and shown at the Academy Awards The whole movie is actors with their backs against the wall emotionally actors peaking They start peaking at the end of Hour 1 I didn t see how they could get any bigger But it s like the Spinal Tap amplifiers They go to 11 They go to 12 When it s time to go to 13 something very strange happens That strange thing isn t thematically unpredictable It has the same logic as the earthquake at the end of Altman s Short Cuts except there it was short and brutal and here it s a full scale surreal black comedy routine I thought it was terrific I think the movie is terrific I don t care what Paul Thomas Anderson is smoking what matters is that he loves actors I think Tom Cruise is I can t believe I m writing this brilliant I think John C Reilly is brilliant I think Julianne Moore is well sorry gotta go to 11 here whee our Vanessa Redgrave At a screening the other day I had the pleasure of listening to Joel Siegel make fun of the movie behind me and John Simon in a separate conversation make fun of the movie in front of me That clinches it it s one of the year s best movies Which might be a good segue for talking about the year s great performances of which there are so many Sarah you re right the actors are keeping pace with the filmmakers daring to leave dreary realism and other misapplications of the Method behind I don t care if they e rocket scientists in life or not on screen they seem so smart A performance like Reese Witherspoon s in Election isn t realistic it only seems that way because she s making imaginative leaps that are so psychologically credible Chlo Sevigny pulls off some uncanny transitions in Boys Don t Cry and they re all subterranean Great as Hilary Swank is it s Sevigny s performance that really captures the mystery at that movie s core In Julien Donkey Boy she looks like a dumb actress stuck in an improv that won t end
