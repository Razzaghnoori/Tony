 August 4 1993 Dear Classmates of 1943 The time of our 50th reunion is rapidly approaching we ll be celebrating that event in Bloomington September 16 18 By now you should have received registration materials for the Fall Alumni Dental Conference If you have not please call the IU Alumni Association 317 274 8828 right away Our class along with 9 other reunion classes has been challenged to support a program which will directly benefit IUSD students Remember the student lounge which we enjoyed so much where we played euchre with some of our teachers Healy Boyd Buck Humphries Boesinger and others where some ate their lunches and some even studied Well the student lounge today is much larger and in a different location and it badly needs upgrading so that it can be a more comfortable place for students to break the tension of their heavy academic load much heavier than what we experienced Together I think we can make a contribution to that upgrading of the lounge which will be very meaningful for the students I have sent a check for 100 and hope that you will consider a like gift or more By the way it must have been 20 years ago or more when I was a member of the faculty that the dean told me they were going to refurnish our old student lounge and asked if I would like to have one of the old octagon shaped oak tables They were pretty beat up and the tops well covered with carvings of teeth initials etc He said that I might midnite requisition one Well I did and sometime later removed it to my cottage in Canada and used decopor a thick clear glazed resin on the top I think it is preserved forever Anyway I treasure that table Someone carved expertly 43 on it A well carved C F Pope appears on it as does Bob Bergman 43 Also carved on the top are the Greek letters of all three fraternities It s obvious from the beautiful carvings of teeth on the surface that we had a good instruction in dental anatomy Someone made it possible for us to have the benefit of that lounge which I m sure you can all still picture in your minds By contributing to the upgrading of today s student lounge we have the opportunity to in a small way provide a part of the memories of IU that will last a lifetime You may recall from my earlier letter regarding our 50th reunion that a room in the Union Building has been reserved for our use following the banquet on Friday A bartender will be available and we will have a chance to enjoy reminiscing the equivalent of our four academic years together and the happenings during the time that has transpired since our graduation 50 years ago Hope you will be present
