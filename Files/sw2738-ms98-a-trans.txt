        have you run into any problems with invasion of privacy there   well what i consider invasion well maybe its just invasion of my private time is i we get a lot of those computer generated uh telephone calls   um   where they just you know go through the list and whenever you pick up the phone its a recording and there youre supposed to hold on for a very important phone call and i feel that if it was so important that they would uh be there instead of putting me on hold   oh well that explains that i got one the other day they they did that uh it was a very important phone call from somewhere and they put me on a dead line for oh it must have been minutes and i said well it couldnt have been that important and i wound up hanging up and ive always wondered what that was   yeah we uh i dont know why it is but there have been so many of those that um instead of the the sales usual sales calls that you get that they um will just run through the list and i guess wait for someone whos going to hang on to talk to them but uh yeah then we get a lot of those   um   almost sort of like these TI phone calls no  right right no these these are beneficial too too uh for personal uh benefit here so   yeah you you dont mind them no most of the people that are looking for me will try to get a hold of me at work thats about the only place they can pin me down   umhum   and uh so about any important phone call that i have im going to get it at work and if the phone call comes to the house chances are its either for my wife or one of the girls   uhhuh   and so i just do not answer the phone call you know ill let it ring until somebody else answers it and if they say dad its for you       i says what are they selling  and id say ninety percent of the time if the calls for me at home its somebody who wants to sell me some oil leases or some   right right swamp land in Florida   some uh grave sites or something like that   yeah we get a lot for uh aluminum siding   um   and uh but yeah what do you all have what do you consider your invasion of privacy   i consider that to be the invasion of privacy particularly when im sitting down at the dinner table and they give me a call and i i have to answer this phone to find out theyre trying to sell me something and my dinners getting cold   right right that seems to be the prime time they call is is definitely well between uh six and eight oclock i guess   yeah well i think for metropolitan areas they realize that most people work and that that probably the majority of people both husband and wife work and so theres nobody home except maybe school kids after school   umhum right   and so they might as well not even try you know not even tie up people dialing phone numbers except in the evening   umhum   fortunately they have uh sufficient respect that they dont call after ten oclock and they dont call before eight oclock in the morning   right im surprised they dont though  uh i but im sure if they did that uh there would be a lot more uh public uh uh voice about it that uh we wouldnt go for that   yeah yeah i think if i got a phone call at six oclock in the morning it was somebody trying to sell me something i would call the phone company immediately and list them as a nuisance call   umhum right and whats so bad about it is um and they dont i mean all it is is they just go through down a list of numbers i mean they dont know who theyre calling it didnt seem like uh it theyre just a haphazard um uh at it so i dont know   yeah but i think thats about the biggest invasion of privacy we have uh there are a few others but uh i presume that they have legitimate purposes   right right   yeah the government seems to intervene quite a bit uh one of the other complaints i have is uh have you ever checked your credit with the credit bureau     uh no not yet   you ought to do that its interesting that to see who has inquired about your uh finances because uh theyre required to keep track and for i think about the preceding year   uhhuh   and its interesting to see who has uh called and inquire about your credit and theres quite a few companies that uh want to send you credit cards or uh charge cards you know will ask for a uh credit dump and then   right   send you a letter trying to get you to take their credit card open a charge account with some company   that now weve gotten several of those letters as far as trying to um sign us up for you know like you youve been uh approved for a pre you know for a credit card and all this and uh ive always wondered how   yeah   and uh why now we had a problem not too long ago our uh my brotherinlaw recently moved and uh somehow or another we we got their new address on our credit reports because the uh i guess the credit card companies or whatever sort of keep up on some of them and uh had uh picked up the new address and was sending all our bills over there   um   so it was like okay now wait a second here so itll be interesting to see how that works out how messed up things will be   yeah that takes some paperwork to get straightened out   yup so that was a mess but uh yeah it the credit there was a report not too long ago on the news here on uh they were going about how easily it was to get information about anyone and uh you know they got a credit history um you know went through all the moves that they made you know their uh   yeah   it was just amazing the stuff that they got and it was so easily you know it was all public uh information it seemed like   umhum well there are uh lists that go by zip codes   umhum   and uh a lot of companies will target people for specific zip codes because of uh you know if you live in the Elton region or Great Falls area of Fairfax County or Montgomery County in Maryland   right uhhuh   uh youre a prime candidate to be living in a rich house and uh spend money on foolish things so uh that gets you on a mailing list for Jaguars and Rolls Royces and things like that   umhum yeah were in one of those counties and uh it uh you get lots of interesting things in the mail in Fort Bend County in southwest Houston the it seems to be the the up grown you know the uh   yeah   the uh new generation or whatever the up and coming people are all are moving out this direction and uh the new its funny to see how the different stores are now changing uh to the um   umhum   new demands and uh or trying to get the different uh people in   yeah   and so uh but yeah i do you know you brought a good point about the um credit histories the credit reports that uh i feel is an can be an invasion of privacy if its used wrong   umhum  well there was something on the news just this morning that uh somebody in doing their   and uh should be so   uh Masters dissertation or something of that nature uh did a study   uhhuh   of uh credit card reports or or credit reports and they found that something like twenty percent of them have erroneous data in there uh data that would prevent that person from getting a loan in the future or or getting a credit advance and uh the information was erroneous   um   so uh i i think everybody recommends that uh well theyve they the uh story this morning on this radio suggested you ought to do this about once a year but i figure about once every five years is good enough   thats right because isnt it uh about fifty dollars to get one oh is it oh okay i was thinking uh maybe i got some wrong information somewhere   uh its about five dollars yeah its fairly cheap yeah well i had it done just to make sure that there wasnt any wrong information in there everything seemed to be all right   right but it its difficult to change those or or easily to correct though oh   well apparent apparently not not if you uh approach the people and and theyre theyre interested in keeping their records accurate   right   but uh its just nice to make sure that no uh uh strange records show up   right   there was one case i think here recently where some fellow down in Southwestern Virginia uh wound up being arrested for uh failure to provide child support and he didnt have any children and he had a heck of a time convincing the authorities that he wasnt the the party that was responsible for failing to make child support payments   oh  i bet his wife was like okay come on what are you not telling me here  right the second life here oh     yeah   oh well i enjoyed talking to you and uh uh you i guess have a nice day thank you byebye   all righty thank you bye
