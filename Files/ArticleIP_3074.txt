 Broken Mainspring If you re in the market Haruki Murakami s The Wind Up Bird Chronicle will teach you how to 1 kill with a bayonet thrust deep under ribs drag in slow deep circle to scramble organs 2 skin a man alive slit skin at shoulder peel slowly down right arm and 3 eliminate a zoo full of carnivores four snipers per tiger best It will steep you in the bizarre lives and roles of 30ish Toru Okada an out of work law clerk bent tip tailed cat owner house husband toupee researcher well dweller and prostitute It will titillate you with red hatted mind readers and sexy phone calls oozing pols and hot dreams ill omened houses and unwaveringly plastic characters named Nutmeg and Cinnamon Hanging over the overwrought whole are an overcast sky and an elusive wind up bird so named for its creeeak creeeak song which nauseates and dooms the select few who hear it Stripped of their powers of volition they become no more than dolls set on tabletops the springs in their backs wound up tight dolls set to move in ways they could not choose moving in directions they could not choose most of them died plunging over the edge of the table How dystopian is Murakami s Japan how sterile and subwayesque Not for him the cherry blossom viewings and golden pavilions of Yukio Mishima the monarchist who disemboweled himself in 1970 No nostalgic ramblings only details that overrun the canvas and add up to nothing A best selling author in his country Murakami s most recent work before Wind Up was Underground a mammoth exploration of the Aum Shinrikyo cult s sarin gas attacks on the Tokyo subway Away at Princeton when they occurred he returned to examine Japan s fascination with the cult and its tubby half blind leader Underground describes a nation bored and isolated by its successes and its failures alike Wind Up fictionalizes that world but barely and to less effect Rootless and lonely Toru Okada plods across his strenuously postmodern space Until that is his spaghetti cooking Rossini humming contentment is dissolved by the sudden departure of first his cat and then his wife of six years Noburu Wataya the cat returns about halfway through the novel of Kumiko the wife one is less sure She works at a health magazine whose strange hours screen her infidelities from an improbably credulous spouse Leaving as if for work one morning she does not return She picks up her dry cleaning the following day however and eventually writes him a letter in which she recounts earth shattering orgasms with other men I m sorry to have to tell you this but the fact is that I was never able to have true sexual pleasure with you Toru s life disintegrates following Kumiko s departure Obsessed with finding her he takes off on a cinematic odyssey that collapses time and space Murakami lays several plot lines and both consummate miniaturist and committed pessimist appears to develop each carefully while keeping the mix unstable And so the pressure builds Toru reaches out to a pair of allegedly clairvoyant sisters as it turns out to little result beyond a few crepuscular couplings that may or may not be real He meets a veteran whose wartime experiences allow Murakami to play anti imperialist Toru s conversations with the lieutenant yield an enduring image a dry well whose dark silences facilitate thought and force people to confront their demons Toru s suburban alley offers convenient access to such a well and into its clich d dankness he descends my body began to lose its density and weight my mind was dragging my body into its own territory It is the perfect birth canal a magical anti environment that both suspends and exaggerates all sensation For Murakami s reader it conjures up the excitement and terror the white hots and the blue colds of childhood treks through a storm sewer system For Toru who is drawn back to it repeatedly it is simultaneously prison and release It makes him face his deepest fears which puddle up in a stigmatic stain on his right cheek then allows him osmotic and healing passage to other worlds and narratives Mysteriously transported from the well to a mysterious Room 208 in a Tokyo hotel he taps into a labyrinth of stories that eventually reconnects him with humanity Murakami s fiction before Wind Up was less ambitious in scale and makes a compelling case for his return to a smaller canvas He is a good reporter well read well traveled and keen eyed All this makes for good documentary and great short stories His book about the cult sticks with the conventions of storytelling and delivers emotion analysis and narrative the many splendored tales that interpolate Toru s story find Murakami at his most engaging Each plot is painstakingly tooled generates momentum and invites you to share But look at the whole and Wind Up confirms the Norman Mailer principle The birth of a great journalist is often paralleled by the death of a novelist Murakami lets the narrative lines so carefully laid snap you re suspended midair your tender attentions scattered to the winds You gulp tell yourself you can transcend the Aristotelian unities and would move on if Murakami allowed you to But he does not In what is either a belated acknowledgment of your investment and his own or less likely a more directly subversive move he starts reeling in the lines about 100 pages from the end The obvious is manfully recapped the bows tied in tweet tidy trills Cinnamon s grandfather the nameless veterinarian and I had a number of unusual things in common a mark on the face a baseball bat the cry of the wind up bird And then there was the lieutenant who appeared in Cinnamon s story he reminded me of Lieutenant Mamiya the war veteran And shortly thereafter Everything was intertwined with the complexity of a three dimensional puzzle a puzzle in which truth was not necessarily fact and fact not necessarily truth Back in Room 208 a few pages before the novel s conclusion Toru encounters a woman on the bed Ping goes the call button in his head I think you are Kumiko Because then all kinds of story lines work out I m tempted to give Murakami the benefit of the doubt to say even that his pat machinations force his readers into his crowd of wound up dolls of whom most died remember plunging over the edge of the table But I ll settle for this Murakami s story ran away with him Too little too late his impulse to tidy resolution testifies more to his discomfort with an expanded canvas than to his plug and socket skills
