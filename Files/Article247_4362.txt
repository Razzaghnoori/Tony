 Slander Patrol Gore s Litmus Test John McCain says Al Gore and Bill Bradley are not qualified to be commander in chief based upon their support of a litmus test for future chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff The Republican National Committee is now running ads that say the same thing Leaving aside the minor nuance that Bradley never endorsed any test at all let alone a litmus test for the Joint Chiefs chairman is McCain right to argue that Gore s position is unreasonable Here s what Gore said in the debate on January 5 in response to a question from Peter Jennings on whether he would have a litmus test for the post of chairman of the Joint Chiefs I would try to bring about the kind of change in policy on the don t ask don t tell policy that President Harry Truman brought about after World War II in integrating the military And I think that would require those who wanted to serve in on the position of on the Joint Chiefs to be in agreement with that policy So yes In answer to a follow up question from Jennings Gore modified his answer slightly I would insist before appointing anybody to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that that individual support my policy the vice president said And yes I would make that a requirement Requiring support is somewhat different than requiring agreement see Kausfiles for further analysis of this distinction After he was attacked for the answer Gore made clear his preference for his second response over his first I did not mean to imply that there should ever be any kind of inquiry into the personal political opinion of officers in the U S military Gore said at an impromptu press conference two days later As Gore belatedly realized support is the better answer because it leaves open the theoretical possibility of appointing a military officer so honorable that he will work assiduously to implement a policy he personally disagrees with But in reality there isn t much of a difference between support and agreement certainly not enough to constitute a reversal which was how the New York Times characterized Gore s adjustment Chairmen and members of the Joint Chiefs who personally oppose this particular change in policy are not likely to put their feelings aside and implement it They re likely to try to sabotage it Consider what happened to Bill Clinton when he tried to lift the ban on gays in the military in 1993 In theory the chairman of the Joint Chiefs at that time Colin Powell was an obedient officer ranking directly below Clinton in the chain of command In practice Powell worked around Clinton to prevent a policy change that he disagreed with After Clinton was elected but before he was sworn in Powell gave a speech at the Naval Academy in Annapolis in which he told midshipmen that if the new policy violated their beliefs they should consider resigning from the military George Stephanopoulos describes the political reality of the situation in his book All Too Human I knew we had no cards to play Stephanopoulos writes describing Clinton s first meeting with Powell and the Joint Chiefs If we didn t work out a compromise with the chiefs they would sabotage us on the Hill While they were obliged to obey their commander they had the right to present their personal views to congressional committees publicly It was in fact the prospect of Powell and the other chiefs testifying before Congress about their personal opposition to allowing gays to serve in the military that gave Sen Sam Nunn the leverage to foist Powell s own preferred compromise of don t ask don t tell on the administration And had Congress not acted it s entirely likely that the chiefs would have worked to sabotage the new policy at the bureaucratic level For this reason Gore s litmus test position is not merely defensible it s the only sensible one to take if you seriously intend to get rid of don t ask don t tell By contrast Bradley s stance that he would expect the chairman of the Joint Chiefs to follow his orders is utterly naive As for the Republican line that all the Joint Chiefs ever do is offer advice and obey their commander in chief it s worse than naive It s disingenuous Conservatives know that litmus untested chiefs are likely to try to undermine a Democratic president s effort to allow gays to serve openly in the military And what s more Republicans want them to undermine it
