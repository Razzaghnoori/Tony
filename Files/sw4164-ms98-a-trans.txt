              hello Larry   sounds like youve got this uh   huh   sounds like youre ready to take a stab at it so why dont you go ahead   okay well i you know i think that uh i think its fine to do that but i dont think it should be mandatory im not       im not for having the equivalent of a draft   yeah i happen to uh this will be a real short one cause i happen to agree with you uh  i think in principal it is a very very good thing but when you make it mandatory uh now youre talking about slavery   thats right its uh   it comes down to um the uh its kind of fun because i had picked the same topic uh last time i dialed in and uh you know which i didnt know it would do um   oh is that right   you know one of the uh things theyre trying to think of is ways you could create or maybe create is wrong but advocate a societal imperative that would have the same goal how could you make it uh   umhum   more desired and respected in society for people to voluntarily uh engage in public service   umhum well id say as far as government jobs uh they could uh have some incentive for instance veterans get a preference when theyre applying for a government job and id say people at   umhum   had voluntarily served in such a thing as the Peace Corps or or something   yeah yeah   could also get that   yeah the uh what do you call it um not sure how you would do that outside of a government sector though and uh   i dont know either and im not sure wed want it   you know i i kind of hope against reality sadly that uh that government sector will get smaller with time but every indication is that it wont   huhuh right   you know   i feel the same way   yeah   uh i think that uh i have nothing against the draft when you know when when the nation needs it uh but obviously when you dont need it you dont have a draft and i feel the same thing with universal service if there was a need for it then id say uh possibly i mean but it would to be an emergency type thing and i and i dont see that ever happening uh   you know my uh my interpretation of history is is is that uh when theres a real need theres usually no shortage of volunteers you know you look at what happened uh in California with the earthquake there were plenty of people volunteering you know you look at World War Two there were plenty of volunteers   umhum thats right   uh you look at from the war in Vietnam all of a sudden there werent a whole lot of volunteers   umhum   and uh you know the question of when do you quote need unquoted on a say for example a draft uh maybe it should be the other way around maybe the willingness of people to volunteer should be determining whether you need it or not   umhum thats thats true   yeah cause uh you know if all you got to do is uh print up a few million draft cards to start a war you know  you it may be a powerful incentive you know what do you call it um     right   by volunteer may be a powerful incentive for keeping people out of uh you know keep keeping us out of may make it a little more difficult to get into war you know there are times you need to   right umhum   i dont perceive myself as a pacifist by any means but um you know there are probably there are places weve been over the years that perhaps we shouldnt have ah i dont think every time we uh wandered into some place it was honest just in itself i think weve screwed up a few times just like everybody else   umhum right i think about on on public service too i think it has some some thought has to be given to what do we want these people to do in public service and and that would have a bearing on what training should they have because if you wanted to have people you know as an incentive you can have people go in after high school   indeed um   and then offer them assistance with their college and that way youd be getting people who really didnt have any expertise in any particular but uh any particular field but theyd be willing hands so so to speak on public service projects   um well you know i i will say i given a choice between somebody with expertise and no interest in working and someone who is enthusiastic but lacks the skill ill take the enthusiasm any day cause you can train that person   umhum right umhum   but somebody thats got no incentive i im not really sure what you can do   are you familiar with the Civilian Conservation Corps back in the thirties   um no that was before my time   okay well i mean its before my time too but i i read about it but you know in the height of the depression the government employed people to go work on public service projects     uhhuh was it like uh WPA   thats right like WPA it was the same thing and there were many uh a lot of the national parks were built up by the Civilian Conservation Corps and a lot of WPA projects are still   uhhuh umhum   serving the the nation   yeah yeah   so uh something you know uh unskilled people could could do things like that as long as they had a positive attitude   hm yeah my only concern about projects like that you know there  my concern is uh youve got this resource whether its uh unemployed people whether its volunteers what have you youve got this resource and what is the best way to target where youre going to point it uh   umhum   you know i dont know the answer to that im not automatically
