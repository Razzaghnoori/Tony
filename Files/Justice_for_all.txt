 Justice for all is a never ending quest Documentary shows how Legal Services aids people who have nowhere else to turn By Rudy Larini Thursday January 23 2003 After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti Jean Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth floor apartment to one on the ground floor Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years The story of Martha a woman from Sierra Leone was more compelling Beaten raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland she knowingly used someone else s passport to escape to America but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival She desperately sought political asylum Not the kind of cases that lead to ground breaking upheavals in the law but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be highlighted in a onehour documentary Quest for Justice to be aired 9 p m today on New Jersey Network Produced by NYD2 a communications firm based in Somerset the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation Joseph a 54 year old naturalized citizen turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground floor apartment Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building s elevator was out of order With this it became impossible for me to stay upstairs he said pointing to the scars on his forearm If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry how can I live It was a compelling case said Legal Services attorney Stephen St Hilaire The key for us and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor struggling with a bag of groceries he said Benjamin 53 of Jersey City had been collecting Social Security disability after undergoing double bypass surgery when the checks stopped coming He said the agency claimed he had failed to return a form updating the condition of his health But what got me was they didn t let me know they didn t get it they just cut me off he said adding he found it impossible to negotiate the Social Security bureaucracy himself When I would call them up or go up there they would give me blank stares he said I didn t know what to do So he contacted Legal Services and his case was assigned to paralegal David Morris Isaac s case was one of government screw ups Morris said recounting how Social Security shuffled his file from New Jersey to Baltimore and then Philadelphia before finally tracking it down Legal Services eventually got Benjamin s benefits restored Martha who does not want her last name used believes she owes her very life to Legal Services and lawyer Laura Adjangba who won her political asylum in the United States This is a great thing she has done for me in this world she said as tears welled up in her eyes God just brought her to take care of my problem In New Jersey Legal Services has represented more than 1 3 million clients since the program was conceived during President Lyndon Johnson s War on Poverty in the mid1960s In a survey last year Legal Services determined that more than one third of New Jersey s poor adults more than 400 000 people have at least one civil legal problem a year There are Legal Services offices in every county except Salem and they handle roughly 50 000 cases a year New Jersey has a Legal Services budget of almost 38 million and a staff of 500 including about 200 attorneys The lawyers many of whom could be earning considerably more in the private sector are uniformly devoted to the principle of providing legal assistance to those who otherwise might be denied their day in court People often say Oh you work with Legal Services because you couldn t work for a big firm with 300 people attorney Grayce Wiggins explains on the documentary People that work at Legal Services are committed to the mission of legal services This is more than just a job This is about changing people s lives With this group you hear them regularly say to a person they are honored to practice this kind of law said Michael DeFabrizio an NYD2 vice president and the executive producer of the documentary In the opening segment of the documentary Nicholas deB Katzenbach who was U S attorney general under Johnson scoffs at the notion that Legal Services is just another government handout I think many people think of Legal Services as something charitable he said The purpose of Legal Services is not to give something to the poor other than the justice that every person is entitled to Does DeFabrizio believe his documentary will help convince people of the need for the kind of help offered by Legal Services You hope that the public cares he said Civilization really depends on human beings caring about other human beings
