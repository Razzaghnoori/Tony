 The Old Old Things Dear David I am skeptical of historical analogies even though Weimar Germany and post Communist Russia never completed their bourgeois revolutions that led to stability look how well Germany is doing today Nor is there an organized Russian Fascism to step in and seize power I do not think we can do anything in Chechnya ghastly as is the Russian behavior Whatever noises we make cannot be backed up by effective actions so that any rhetoric in the end may make us look even more foolish But this is not the place to deal with such complex issues Since I believe that normal Western politics is the politics of platitudes and looking at Russia perhaps we should not knock that I am going to pick up my theme of our democratic domestic rhetoric and come back to your turf that of history in a reverse manner So Yesterday I mentioned Tony Giddens as the house intellectual for Tony Blair In thinking back every Democratic administration has had a resident in house intellectual John F Kennedy had Arthur M Schlesinger Jr Lyndon Johnson had John P Roche a former president of the ADA Jimmy Carter had Pat Caddell the Harvard pollster and Bill Clinton has Sidney Blumenthal who is sui generis The Republicans do not seem to have had any such intellectuals perhaps because they distrust them But then who wrote Ronald Reagan s flash cards The function of the in house intellectual is to think up Big Ideas that are to be imprinted into the historical period of the time New Frontier Great Society or to stroke visiting journalists or to combat other intellectuals Arthur Schlesinger propagated the idea that JFK would have taken us out of Vietnam if he had lived John Roche tried to pin Vietnam on JFK Pat Caddell fashioned Carter s malaise speech blaming the people for the funk we were in recalling the Brecht remark the people are against the government the government has to change the people and now Sidney Blumenthal The other week Godfrey Hodgson a British journalist wrote an essay in The Guardian Weekly about an encounter in the White House President Clinton s communications director Sidney Blumenthal was rhapsodic over dinner People in Europe do not understand he complained that the U S was creating a world society The new politics the new economics the new technology and the new immigration were coming together to change the tired old rules of the game There was more in the same poetic vein Two days ago was the 200 th anniversary of the death of George Washington On the Jim Lehrer NewsHour Richard Brookhiser who has written a book called Founding Father said that what George Washington had done was to create a new nation and a new people And in 1963 36 years ago Martin Lipset wrote a book about our founding called The First New Nation So new is obviously a tattered tired old term Nu nu Two hundred years Is that a long time historically speaking In 1940 I became a staff writer on the New Leader then a large format newspaper weekly The editor of the paper was a quiet courtly old man named William E Bohn He wrote the editorials Victor Riesel and I wrote most of the paper We used pseudonyms to fill up the pages I used John Donne until Hemingway s book came out and then shifted to Andrew Marvell After we had put the paper to bed on Thursday mornings we would sit and talk about history Bill Bohn had been expelled as a teacher from the University of Pennsylvania in 1913 because he was a socialist He startled us once by saying that his older brother had fought in the American Civil War and that his grandfather had fought against Napoleon in 1815 So that was three degrees of separation Your young son Joseph will probably go to 2080 so for almost 300 years that will be six degrees of separation But history was always a living presence I think of my late lamented friend Boris Shub son of the Menshevik historian David Shub who had set up RIAS the radio station in the American sector in Berlin in 1945 a major cold war propaganda asset When Boris was at De Witt Clinton High School in New York in the 30s his history teacher once remarked that in February 1917 Alexander Kerensky had made the Russian Revolution and was soon after overthrown by Lenin Boris shot up his hand and said Kerensky did not make the February revolution That had been made by the Cadets Constitutional Democrats under Prince Lvov Lenin did not come to Russia until April in the sealed train across Germany Kerensky had refused to take a job in the first cabinet but did in the second one when Muliukov became prime minister and Kerensky became minister of war In the third reshuffle Kerensky became prime minister How do you know all this asked the startled teacher Because Kerensky told me Boris replied Kerensky lived until 1970 and one could see him as I did walking across the Stanford campus where he was affiliated with the Hoover Institution History lives What impresses me in fact is that with all the blather about the new there is a hunger for history and for many people the old is more relevant than the new I was struck by this a decade or so ago when I was in Prague then still under Communist rule where I had been invited to give a few lectures to some Party institutes about technology At least the theory of it After the sessions my hosts eagerly escorted me around the city and took me to the towering Hradcany Castle Kafka s Castle since he had once lived in a small hovel in the wall underneath What they wanted to talk about was not the future but the past about the days of Rudolf II who had ruled the Holy Roman Empire in the 16 th century when Prague dominated Europe before Vienna And to show me the famous window of the Defenestration of Prague the glorious day in May 1618 during the Thirty Years War when two royal Catholic officers had been hurled from the window by the Protestant members of the Bohemian Diet and being in Prague had landed on a haystack below And I think earlier this year of Serbia where the bones of Prince Lazar the martyr of the battle against the Turks in 1389 have become hallowed in history and whose legends were written down by church scribes and canonized in cycles of folk poetry In commemoration of the 600 th anniversary of the great battle in 1989 Lazar s bones were taken for a tour around Serbia and Bosnia from monastery to monastery Today they lie in Ravinica and on Sundays the coffin is opened for the faithful and his brown and withered hands peek out from under the shroud Will Lenin s embalmed body be around for 600 years I know that these are alleged bones and emotional sentiments are whipped up by the prayers of the priests and the nuns But people believe or want to believe That is why icons have the power they have But since this will be the last round before the end of the century shall we conclude with a discussion of the Millennium but which one Love Dad
