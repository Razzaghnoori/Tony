 Background Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of osteomyelitis a disease often refractory to treatment and subject to recurrence Traditional treatment for osteomyelitis involves surgical debridement of infected tissue coupled with systemic antibiotic therapy Only a few decades ago the majority of S aureus strains associated with osteomyelitis were susceptible to antibiotics including methicillin However the emergence of antibiotic resistance among strains of S aureus has rendered methicillin and many other antibiotics less effective against this organism Consequently there is an urgent need for the development of novel therapies for the treatment of osteomyelitis S aureus is a capable bone pathogen in part because it possesses several cell surface adhesion molecules that facilitate its binding to bone matrix Binding involves a family of adhesins that interact with extracellular matrix components and these adhesins have been termed microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules MSCRAMMs 1 Specific MSCRAMMs are responsible for localization of S aureus to particular tissues and include fibronectin binding proteins FnBPs 2 3 fibrinogen binding proteins 4 5 6 elastin binding adhesin 7 collagen binding adhesion 8 and a broad specificity adhesin MAP that facilitates low affinity binding of S aureus to several proteins including osteopontin collagen bone sialoprotein fibronectin fibrinogen and vitronectin 9 S aureus can utilize MSCRAMMs to adhere directly to cells or can attach to cells through the use of bridging ligands such as Hsp60 which has an affinity for both MSCRAMMs and the 1 integrin host cell receptor 10 11 Interaction of S aureus with host cells via MSCRAMMs can induce signal transduction tyrosine kinase activity and cytoskeletal rearrangement 12 Compared to other bacteria S aureus is generally not considered a significant intracellular pathogen Staphylococci have typically been regarded as non invasive extracellular pathogens that damage host cells after adhering to the extracellular matrix however there is growing evidence that S aureus has the ability to invade and persist within eukaryotic cells S aureus has been shown to be ingested by non professional phagocytes such as mouse fibroblasts 13 mouse renal cells 14 and bovine mammary epithelial cells 15 16 S aureus also has the ability to invade mouse and human osteoblast cell lines 17 18 as well as normal mouse and human osteoblasts 19 Finally S aureus has been shown to invade normal chick osteoblasts both in vitro and in vivo 20 21 S aureus cells were found in approximately 14 of calvarial osteoblasts after subcutaneous injection of chick embryos and in 11 of calvarial and tibial osteoblasts following intra allantoic injection Similar to most in vitro studies the majority of intracellular bacteria are eventually free in the osteoblast cytoplasm in vivo S aureus cells in calvariae and tibiae were also observed in the cytoplasm of approximately 4 of the osteocytes in mineralized bone matrix Therefore osteoblasts containing internalized S aureus cells continue differentiating into osteocytes In addition S aureus invasion of osteoblasts stimulates the secretion of interleukin IL 6 IL 12 and colony stimulating factors 19 22 23 These cytokines can potentially exacerbate the bone destruction already characteristic of infection by activation of osteoclasts In addition to osteoclast activation S aureus inhibits bone matrix synthesis further compounding bone loss observed with osteomyelitis 24 The ability of S aureus to survive in the eukaryotic intracellular environment could explain several aspects of chronic staphylococcal diseases and long term colonization Internalization may provide a means of protection against host defenses and certain classes of antibiotics Many staphylococcal infections which tend to become chronic e g osteomyelitis and mastitis are associated with multiple recurrences and do not resolve even in the presence of what seems to be an adequate humoral immune response 25 26 27 28 For example patients can have recurrent attacks of osteomyelitis after completion of treatment even when causative organisms cannot be isolated 25 Staphylococcal infections are typically associated with death of tissue and evidence suggests intracellular bacteria are capable of inducing apoptosis S aureus mediated apoptosis has been reported in epithelial cells 16 29 30 keratinocytes 31 endothelial cells 32 33 and osteoblasts 34 The two global gene regulatory loci agr and sar have been demonstrated to play a role in the induction of apoptosis in epithelial cells by S aureus 33 Mutants in the agr or sar loci are internalized but do not induce apoptosis 33 Another study demonstrated induction of apoptosis in endothelial cells by staphylococcal alpha toxin 32 Wesson et al 30 demonstrated host caspases 8 and 3 to play a role in S aureus induced apoptosis and caspase 8 is known to be associated with apoptosis triggered by engagement of death receptors 35 Several recent studies have associated microbial induction of apoptosis with the production of tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand TRAIL Measles virus was the first infectious agent shown to induce TRAIL production 36 Other studies have demonstrated induction of TRAIL by Theiler s murine encephalomyelitis virus TMEV in M1 D cells a myelomonocytic precursor cell line 37 reovirus infection in fibroblasts 38 HIV 1 infection in CD4 T cells 39 and adenovirus in 239T cells 40 The demonstration of caspase 8 involvement in S aureus induced apoptosis is complemented by a recent report from our laboratory that S aureus induces expression of TRAIL by infected osteoblasts 41 We reported that S aureus strongly induces TRAIL expression by both normal mouse and normal human osteoblasts while mRNAs encoding the death domain containing TRAIL receptors are constitutively expressed in the same cells S aureus caused a rapid and sustained up regulation of TRAIL mRNA and TRAIL protein expression TRAIL is also secreted by S aureus infected osteoblasts suggesting that TRAIL could influence cells outside the environment of a localized bacterial infection In the present study we examined the ability of purified bacterial surface structures and extracellular products to induce TRAIL expression in osteoblasts The ability of TRAIL produced by S aureus infected osteoblasts to mediate osteoblast apoptosis was also examined Results demonstrate that purified bacterial surface structures and S aureus extracellular products present outside osteoblasts are not a sufficient stimulus for TRAIL induction and that physical contact between bacteria and osteoblasts is required for optimal induction of TRAIL expression TRAIL produced by S aureus infected osteoblasts does induce caspase 8 activation and apoptosis Collectively these results reveal TRAIL induction and caspase 8 activation as a mechanism whereby S aureus mediates apoptosis in osteoblasts Results Purified bacterial products in the osteoblast extracellular environment do not induce TRAIL expression In order to determine the role of S aureus derived peptidoglycan and teichoic acid in the expression of TRAIL by S aureus infected osteoblasts cultured normal human osteoblasts were incubated with various concentrations of these purified cell wall structures 10 ng ml 100 ng ml or 1 g ml Additionally osteoblasts were incubated with various concentrations of staphylococcal enterotoxin A SEA 10 ng ml 100 ng ml or 1 g ml used here as a representative superantigen from S aureus or with a purified component of gram negative bacteria specifically lipopolysaccharide LPS 10 ng ml 100 ng ml or 1 g ml The concentrations of staphylococcal peptidoglycan teichoic acid SEA and LPS tested did not induce TRAIL expression in osteoblasts Fig 1 Results for the lower concentrations of teichoic acid and SEA 10 ng ml and 100 ng ml are not shown As previously reported 41 TRAIL protein was induced in osteoblasts infected with S aureus Fig 1 These results demonstrate that major surface components from these bacteria in a purified form present in the osteoblast extracellular environment are not sufficient to induce TRAIL expression in normal human osteoblasts Induction of TRAIL by S aureusrequires physical contact between bacteria and osteoblasts Studies indicate that the invasion ability of bacteria are most relevant to the magnitude of the osteoblast response 42 43 In previous experiments examining the production of TRAIL by S aureus infected osteoblasts bacteria were in direct contact with the cells 41 such that the potential of S aureus extracellular products to induce osteoblast expression and secretion of TRAIL could not be addressed To determine if S aureus extracellular products induce TRAIL expression in osteoblasts normal mouse osteoblasts were grown in 12 well cluster plates S aureus strain UAMS 1 at a MOI of 25 1 75 1 or 250 1 was then added separately to Transwell cell culture chamber inserts The inserts were placed into the 12 well plates containing osteoblasts followed by incubation for 45 minutes The polycarbonate membrane at the base of each chamber insert contains pores 0 4 m in size and precludes direct interaction between the bacteria and osteoblasts However the inserts allow for the exchange of extracellular products Direct physical contact between S aureus and osteoblasts at a MOI of 250 1 induced osteoblast TRAIL protein expression Fig 2 TRAIL protein was not expressed in osteoblast cultures co incubated with S aureus at various MOIs where physical contact between the bacteria and osteoblasts was prevented Fig 2 These results demonstrate that physical contact between the host and pathogen is required for optimal TRAIL induction The importance of bacterial internalization however could not be addressed in these experiments TRAIL induces apoptosis in osteoblasts TRAIL may mediate a number of physiological responses therefore in order to determine if TRAIL expressed by S aureus infected osteoblasts mediates osteoblast apoptosis cultured normal mouse osteoblasts were infected with S aureus strain UAMS 1 at various MOIs in the presence and absence of an anti human TRAIL polyclonal antibody Osteoblasts were stained with annexin V and propidium iodide PI Redistribution of phosphotidylserine from the inner leaflet to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane occurs early and is a hallmark of the apoptotic process Annexin V has a high affinity for phosphatidylserine and was used to detect apoptotic cells Propidium iodide can be used to distinguish early apoptotic cells from late apoptotic cells Early apoptotic cells stain positive for annexin V and negative for PI where as late apoptotic cells stain positive for both annexin V and PI 44 After staining osteoblasts were analyzed using FACS Fig 3 Approximately 14 89 of the cells from uninfected osteoblast cultures were annexin V positive The percentage of annexin V positive cells increased to 32 17 following infection with S aureus at a MOI of 75 1 corresponding to a greater than 2 fold increase over that of uninfected control osteoblast cultures A 25 reduction in annexin V positive cells was observed in the presence of 1 g ml of anti human TRAIL antibody A 2 g ml concentration of anti TRAIL antibody further reduced the population of annexin V positive cells to 25 42 of total osteoblasts corresponding to an approximately 40 decrease in the level of annexin V positive cells in S aureus infected cultures A dose dependent decrease in annexin V positive cells was observed by the addition of increasing amounts of the anti human TRAIL antibody These results strongly suggest TRAIL production induces osteoblast apoptosis in S aureus infected osteoblast cultures The role of TRAIL in S aureus induced apoptosis is likely more significant than what is revealed by these experiments since an anti human TRAIL antibody was used to neutralize mouse TRAIL protein Utilization of an anti mouse TRAIL antibody would be predicted to further reduce the level of S aureus induced apoptosis in infected mouse osteoblast cultures S aureusinduces caspase 8 activation in osteoblasts S aureus mediated apoptosis has been reported for a variety of cells including osteoblasts A recent report demonstrated that S aureus induced apoptosis of epithelial cells involves activation of caspases 8 and 3 30 To determine whether caspase 8 is activated in S aureus infected osteoblasts cultured normal mouse osteoblasts were infected with S aureus strain UAMS 1 at various MOIs As a positive control osteoblasts were stimulated with cycloheximide CHX a compound known to induce caspase 8 activation 45 At various times post infection endogenous caspase 8 activity was quantified Activated caspase 8 was detected in uninfected control osteoblast cultures Fig 4 and is attributable to apoptosis and cell turnover in the in vitro osteoblast tissue culture system Osteoblasts infected with S aureus at a MOI of 75 1 demonstrated a 2 fold increase in activated caspase 8 45 min post infection which was significantly higher than the level of activated caspase 8 in the uninfected control p 0 05 Fig 4 This early activation of caspase 8 in S aureus infected osteoblasts coincides with previous observations in other systems For example caspase 8 is activated in HeLa cells within 1 h following the administration of TRAIL 46 The level of caspase 8 activation in osteoblasts exposed to CHX a known activator of caspase 8 45 was significantly higher than the level of activity in uninfected cells and was equivalent to the level in S aureus infected osteoblasts Fig 4 S aureus induced caspase 8 activation was sustained for 2 h following infection data not shown In fact the levels of activated caspase 8 were significantly higher at 2 h than at 45 min post infection in S aureus infected osteoblasts Caspase 8 has been identified as an initiator caspase activated in death receptor mediated apoptosis 47 Therefore we investigated whether blockade of TRAIL expressed by S aureus infected osteoblasts had any effect on the levels of caspase 8 enzymatic activity Mouse osteoblasts were infected with S aureus in the presence of increasing concentrations of anti human TRAIL antibody Figure 4demonstrates that anti TRAIL antibody interferes with caspase 8 activation A clear dose response was observed in the levels of caspase 8 enzymatic activity As the concentrations of the anti TRAIL antibody increase the levels of caspase 8 specific activity decrease The highest concentration of anti TRAIL antibody utilized significantly reduced the level of caspase 8 enzymatic activity in S aureus infected osteoblast cultures at 45 min and 2 h post infection p 0 05 Fig 4and data not shown These results suggest that caspase 8 activation is mediated by TRAIL and that induction of apoptosis by TRAIL utilizes an intracellular mechanism involving caspase 8 activation Discussion TRAIL is a member of the TNF gene superfamily of receptors and ligands and was discovered based on sequence homology to other members of the superfamily using an EST database 48 Among other family members TRAIL is most similar to Fas ligand sharing 28 homology TRAIL can be expressed as a membrane bound protein or solubilized by metalloendoproteinase cleavage The bioactive form of TRAIL is as a homotrimer 49 There are five known human TRAIL receptors including R1 R2 R3 R4 and osteoprotegerin OPG however R1 and R2 are the only TRAIL receptors known to contain complete death domains The signaling pathways of TRAIL and its receptors are not fully known 50 however recent studies suggest TRAIL activates pathways similar to those activated by TNF and its receptors 49 Binding of TRAIL to death domain containing receptors can cause apoptosis via activation of caspase 8 in Jurkat and HeLa cells 46 49 We have previously demonstrated that S aureus induces TRAIL expression in normal human and mouse osteoblasts 41 Messenger RNA encoding TRAIL is rapidly and dramatically up regulated following exposure of osteoblasts to S aureus TRAIL mRNA expression is absent in uninfected cultures and shows a dose dependent response to S aureus In contrast to the inducible nature of TRAIL mRNA the messages encoding death domain containing TRAIL receptors are constitutively expressed in human and mouse osteoblasts 41 Additionally TRAIL protein is expressed and secreted following infection of osteoblasts with S aureus In contrast uninfected osteoblasts do not express significant amounts of TRAIL protein The current study examined possible mechanisms whereby S aureus induces TRAIL expression in osteoblasts Osteoblasts were incubated with various concentrations of major surface components of S aureus peptidoglycan and teichoic acid as well as LPS of gram negative bacteria to determine if these were potential inducers of TRAIL expression These bacterial components were chosen based on their ability to induce inflammatory responses The two major components of the staphylococcal cell wall peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid have been reported to produce inflammation 51 52 and specifically to induce arthritis 53 Bacterial peptidoglycan is also known to stimulate the bone resorbing activity of macrophages 54 Furthermore staphylococci produce an array of secreted products capable of inducing or sustaining inflammation For example the staphylococcal superantigens induce prolonged inflammatory responses associated with arthritis and destruction of bone connective tissue 55 Our results demonstrate that peptidoglycan teichoic acid LPS and the staphylococcal superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A SEA when present in the osteoblast extracellular environment do not induce TRAIL expression Fig 1 These findings do not eliminate the possibility that these bacterial structures contribute to TRAIL induction They are nevertheless insufficient by themselves to elicit such a response in osteoblasts exposed extracellularly to the molecules at the concentrations analyzed The concentrations of bacterial products chosen were based on previous reports suggesting these amounts are appropriate and sufficient to elicit cytokine responses from human cells 56 57 It is possible that one or more of the purified products analyzed contribute to TRAIL induction but only if expressed inside osteoblasts While intracellular S aureus is known to induce TRAIL expression in osteoblasts 41 the ability of extracellular staphylococcal products to induce TRAIL expression has not been previously investigated Results from the Transwell co culture experiments Fig 2 demonstrate that extracellular bacterial products do not induce TRAIL expression S aureus at a MOI of 25 1 75 1 or 250 1 was unable to induce TRAIL expression when direct contact between bacteria and osteoblasts was precluded Even at the highest MOI used no TRAIL was detected in response to the co incubation with S aureus The bacteria must be in physical contact and potentially internalized by the osteoblasts before TRAIL expression is induced These findings could indicate that attachment of S aureus to osteoblasts initiates a cascade ultimately inducing TRAIL expression Alternatively intracellular bacteria may be the only S aureus cells capable of inducing TRAIL expression by osteoblasts TRAIL clearly mediates cell death in other tissues but also has the potential to mediate a variety of other physiological responses in bone Osteoblasts are known to secrete tumor necrosis factor related activation induced cytokine TRANCE RANK L which acts on the TRANCE receptor TRANCE R RANK found on osteoclast precursors Binding of TRANCE to TRANCE R induces osteoclastogenesis and therefore bone resorption Osteoblasts are also known to secrete osteoprotegerin OPG which binds TRANCE thus inhibiting osteoclastogenesis Because OPG is a soluble receptor for TRAIL 58 S aureus induced TRAIL secretion could have a profound effect on both osteoblasts and osteoclasts Therefore the ability of TRAIL expressed by S aureus infected osteoblasts to mediate osteoblast apoptosis was examined S aureus induces osteoblast apoptosis 34 When osteoblasts were exposed to S aureus at a MOI of 75 1 the percentages of annexin V positive cells increased from 14 89 to 32 17 of cells in culture Fig 3 Numbers of annexin V positive cells were reduced 40 by the addition of anti TRAIL antibody 2 g ml to S aureus infected osteoblast cultures While the antibodies did not completely inhibit S aureus induced apoptosis these results demonstrate that TRAIL contributes to apoptosis in S aureus infected cultures TRAIL mediated apoptosis of S aureus infected osteoblasts suggests a mechanism whereby S aureus induces the bone loss and destruction associated with osteomyelitis The inability of the anti TRAIL antibodies to completely block apoptosis induced by S aureus may be attributable to the specificity of the antibody used for these experiments or the dosage used since an anti human TRAIL antibody was used to neutralize mouse TRAIL protein The role of TRAIL in S aureus induced apoptosis is therefore likely to be more significant than what is revealed by these experiments Utilization of an anti mouse TRAIL antibody would be predicted to be more effective in reducing the level of S aureus induced apoptosis in infected mouse osteoblast cultures In addition S aureus may also induce apoptosis by a mechanism distinct from TRAIL It is known for example that S aureus toxin induces apoptosis in Jurkat cells via the Bcl 2 controlled mitochondrial death pathway 32 therefore neutralization of TRAIL would not be expected to interfere with this mechanism of apoptosis induction TRAIL induced apoptosis involves activation of caspase 8 in other systems Earlier studies have shown that blockade of caspase 8 activation in HeLa cells and deletion of caspase 8 in Jurkat cells prevented activation of downstream signaling resulting in a failure of the cells to undergo apoptosis in response to TRAIL 46 Similarly another group has demonstrated that apoptosis induced by S aureus in bovine mammary epithelial MAC T cells utilizes a mechanism involving caspases 8 and 3 which are two key components of the proteolytic cascade that leads to apoptosis 30 Results from the current study demonstrate a two fold increase in caspase 8 activation upon infection with S aureus Fig 4 Active caspase 8 was detected in uninfected control osteoblast cultures Fig 4 and is attributable to apoptosis and cell turnover in the in vitro osteoblast tissue culture systems The level of activated caspase 8 in S aureus infected osteoblasts was significantly higher than the level of activated caspase 8 in uninfected osteoblast control cultures p 0 05 Caspase 8 activation in osteoblasts exposed to CHX was also higher than the level of activity in uninfected cells but equivalent to the level in infected osteoblasts Fig 4 These results demonstrate that S aureus is a potent inducer of caspase 8 activation in osteoblasts equivalent to a known inducer of caspase 8 45 Overall the levels of caspase 8 enzymatic activity at 2 h were significantly higher compared to the ones obtained 45 min post infection data not shown Neutralization of TRAIL by the addition of the anti TRAIL antibody interfered with caspase 8 activation demonstrating a dose dependent response As the concentrations of the anti TRAIL antibody increased the levels of caspase 8 activation decreased The highest concentration of antibodies used significantly reduced the level of caspase 8 activation in S aureus infected osteoblast cultures p 0 05 These findings demonstrate that activation of caspase 8 in S aureus infected osteoblasts is at least in part TRAIL dependent Conclusions Collectively these findings reveal that S aureus induces apoptosis in osteoblasts via a mechanism involving TRAIL induction and caspase 8 activation Induction of TRAIL by S aureus requires the bacteria to be in contact with and potentially internalized by the osteoblasts Although the exact mechanism whereby S aureus induces TRAIL expression remains to be determined this study suggests that major bacterial surface structures present in the osteoblast extracellular environment do not induce TRAIL Since TRAIL mediates a number of physiological responses the impact of S aureus induced TRAIL expression on normal bone physiology should be explored The role of S aureus induced TRAIL in apoptosis and osteoclastogenesis in vivo is currently being examined
