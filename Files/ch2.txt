twoin and out of fashionBryant Park in midtown Manhattan is the site of a biannual fashion show Twice a year in large white tents crammed with reporters photographers editors and celebrity guests models parade designers wares on the runway Bryant Park is also a good place to observe an architectural fashion show A row of Twenties beauties lines th Street along the south side of the park First is Ely Jacques Kahns French Renaissance office building originally the headquarters of Scientific American Its neighbor is the stately Classical Engineers Club Then comes a flapper Raymond Hoods American Radiator Building whose black brick and gold trim sets it apart from its neighbors Charles Richs Bryant Park Studios an elegant survivor of the late Gilded Age is at the Sixth Avenue corner The large northfacing windows and glazed penthouse are a reminder that this building was originally intended for artistsBryant Park Studios is built in an architectural style that was originally called Modern French but today is commonly referred to as BeauxArts in recognition of the influential Ecole des BeauxArts in Paris Starting with Richard Morris Hunt during the second half of the nineteenth century many of the best American architects were graduates of the Ecole H H Richardson and his protg Charles Follen McKim were alumni as well as McKims assistants John M Carrre and Thomas Hastings Carrre and Hastings were the architects of the New York Public Library whose stately presence commands the east side of Bryant Park Narrow strips of windows indicate the bookstacks above them nine thermal windows signal the vast reading room In typical BeauxArts fashion the faade manages to appear both grandly monumental and coolly rational except for a curious row of little doorways high up the wall which lack balconies or even railings and open into midair The strange little skyexits which a friend who works at the library claims are for staff defenestration provide a fanciful note to the great marble faadeA row of nononsense s office blocks lines Sixth Avenue on the west side of the park The largest is the New York Telephone Company Building whose banal faade of graytinted glass and vertical strips of marble fills the block between st and nd Street The north side of the park is dominated by the fiftystory W R Grace Building designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore Owings  Merrill in  The swooping travertine faade appears to have been inspired by the buildings of Braslia This bit of tropical flash is flanked by an undistinguished mirrored glass tower and a generic brickandColonialtrim box Built  years apart these commercial office blocks share a balefully functionalist approach to architecture They are strictly offtherack buildings that only a developer could loveBryant Park also offers distant views of two of Manhattans most distinctive skyscrapers the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building The Chrysler Building started life as a speculative office building In  the architect William Van Alen influenced by the recent Parisian exhibition of the arts dcoratifs designed a skyscraper in a style that has come to be known as Art Deco When the plans were finished but before construction had begun the design and the building site were bought by the automobile magnate Walter P Chrysler Chrysler wanted the building to serve as a billboard for his company Van Alen obligingly grafted on eaglehead gargoyles based on hood ornaments winged radiator caps a frieze of steel hubcaps and black brick accents that suggest running boards The towers most distinctive feature was its stainlesssteel cap which held the Cloud Club a private dining room for Chrysler executives Today the flamboyant Chrysler Building is considered a brilliant emblem of the Jazz Age but it was not an instant success When it was built it was roundly criticized as frivolous and flashy A stunt design sniffed The New Yorker The New York Times likewise derided the blatant commercialism of the architectureThe Chrysler Building had the distinction of being the worlds tallest buildingfor a few months until it was surpassed by the Empire State Building Although designed at the same time as the Chrysler the Empire State is quite different in appearance Its exterior is the architectural equivalent of a gray flannel suit There is no decoration The plain limestone walls lack even traditional cornices chromenickel steel mullions extend uninterrupted from the th to the th floor accentuating the buildings height Ornament is crime Adolf Loos had proclaimed years before but the strippeddown appearance of the Empire State Building owed more to an accelerated building scheduleconstruction took less than eighteen monthsthan to architectural ideology In fact the architects of the skyscraper considered themselves traditionalists Richmond H Shreve worked for Carrre  Hastings on the New York Public Library where he met William Lamb a recent Ecole graduate After Carrres unfortunate death in an auto accident and Hastings retirement Shreve and Lamb took over the firm for several years it was called Carrre  Hastings Shreve  Lamb and were eventually joined by Arthur Loomis Harmon who had worked for McKim Mead  White on the Metropolitan Museum of Art Despiteor rather because oftheir solid Classical roots Shreve Lamb and Harmon designed a beautifully proportioned building that became the most famous skyscraper in the worldThe Empire State Building has one whimsical touch The final plans called for the skyscraper to end with a flat roof over the th floor feet precisely calculated to be two feet higher than the top of the Chrysler Buildings spire Then before construction began the owners decided that two feet was not enough and ordered the architects to add a foot tower to the top of the building This was to be not merely a decorative spire but a functioning symbol of the modern age a mooring tower for airships Instead of dropping transatlantic travelers off at Lakehurst NJ the thousandfootlong dirigibles would fly right into Manhattan and hook themselves up to the top of the Empire State Building Passengers would disembark to an observation platform and descend by elevator to a lounge and customs area on the th floor Most experts including Hugo Eckener commander of the Graf Zeppelin doubted that it could be done It was hard enough to dock the unwieldy leviathans at ground level never mind  feet up in the air The experts proved to be right and no airship passengers ever landed atop the Empire State Yet the rocketshaped tower with its cast aluminum buttresses and gleaming conical top is the perfect fanciful crown for this rather solemn skyscraperWhimsy is absent from the tops of the s office blocks around Bryant Park They look as if the architects had lopped them off on a whim I can do  floors or  or  Just tell me when to stop More recent skyscrapers around Bryant Park no doubt emboldened by Philip Johnsons Chippendale top on his ATT Building have more animated crowns The hipped roof of a Fifth Avenue Postmodern highrise adorned with circles and squares peeks out above the library The top of the Bertelsmann Building is a slender spike The new Cond Nast office tower has tilted forms resembling speaker cabinets on its roof Pretty tame stuff compared to the more fanciful crowns of the s buildingsneoGothic spires Romanesque tile roofs copper domes The  floors of  Fifth Avenue at the corner of Fifth Avenue and nd Street which was designed by Shreve  Lamb prior to the Empire State Building step back dramatically as they reach the buildings apex Spiky wroughtiron finials enliven the chateaulike roof of the Scientific American Building An animated silhouette of black brick with gilded and red highlights crowns the Radiator Building According to Hood the dramatic effect floodlit at night suggested a pile of coal glowing at the topRaymond M Hood was the outstanding commercial architect of the s He and John Mead Howells won a celebrated international architectural competition for the Chicago Tribune tower in Chicago with a handsome Gothic design based on the Butter Tower of Rouen Cathedral The Chicago Tribune competition led to several New York commissions including the Radiator Building the Daily News Building and the McGrawHill Building With these designs Hood developed the distinctly American approach to skyscrapers that would influence Van Alen and a generation of skyscraper designers tall buildings conceived as Nietzschean symbols of corporate power or to put it more mundanely architecture as advertising Hood once pointed out that since modern office buildings would be amortized in only  years architects had an opportunity to experiment The Daily News is a robust pinnacle with alternating vertical strips of masonry and glass His final skyscraper the McGrawHill Building is a witty bluegreen take on the International Style complete with the companys name in huge Broadway style lettering on the top Hood was also one of the key designers in the team of architects responsible for Rockefeller Center His influence is felt in the centerpiece tower the story clifflike RCA Building This twentiethcentury abstracted version of medieval verticality is one of New Yorks most evocative skyscrapers unsurpassed since it was completed in Bryant Park chronicles a hundred years of changing architectural fashions Buildings are sometimes referred to as timeless as if this were the highest praise one could bestow That is nonsense The best buildings like the Chrysler or the New York Public Library or the RCA are precisely of their time That is part of the pleasure of looking at buildings from the past They reflect old values and bygone virtues and vices the selfconfidence of the library the cheerful boosterism of Chrysler the sobriety of RCA Even the bland goofiness of the Grace Building recalls the nave optimism of an earlier era That is why old buildings are precious that is why we fight to preserve them It is not only because we think them beautiful or significant It is also because they remind us of who we once were And of who we might be again for old buildings also inspire The ruins of ancient Rome inspired the Renaissance architects The palazzos of Renaissance Italy inspired Charles McKim And the memory of McKims Pennsylvania Station inspired David Childs of Skidmore Owings  Merrill to transform McKims old Post Office Building into a projected railroad terminal for the citySometimes old buildings inspire us sometimes the opposite is true We look at an old building and ask ourselves What on earth were those people thinking of I cannot warm to heroic public buildings of the s for example It is more than  years since Lincoln Center was built enough time for the buildings to mellow yet I cant summon any sympathy for the colonnaded brutes The idea of putting three theaters under one roof must have been compelling at one time but when I visit the Kennedy Center in Washington DC all I see are miles of red carpeting in those Brobdingnagian lobbies Yet who knows Perhaps one day a future generation will see something in these buildings that eludes meThe Kennedy Center was criticized from the start but the dazzling dcor of Radio City Music Hall which opened in in the midst of the Depressionguaranteed its immediate success Radio City became the most famous theater in the country the Rockettes the most famous chorus line live from Radio City the most famous dateline In the late s when I visited New York City as a boy with my parents Radio City was still one of the obligatory tourist sites What I dont remember is ever learning about Radio City as an architecture student According to the reductive standards of my International Style teachers its opulent materials its glowing colors and its very theatricality disqualified Radio City as architecture never mind that it was a technologically sophisticated machine for entertainment It was dismissed as kitsch By  Radio City had lost its glamour and the owners of Rockefeller Center decided to demolish the aging hall Thanks to preservationists efforts the hall was saved from demolition and granted landmark status Now  years later freshened by a masterful restoration it is once again acclaimed as a masterpieceRadio City Music Hall is a reminder that it is not buildings that change but architectural fashions What seemed exciting in one decade looks gaudy if not downright embarrassing in the nextor simply boring When old buildings are torn down the motive may be expediency or crass commercialism but it may also be a desire for something new This is as true of buildings as it is of womens hats pace Le CorbusierFashion has increasinglyand restrictivelybecome a term used in connection with womens dress as in fashion designer or the fashion industry The Oxford English Dictionary defines fashion more broadly as the mode of dress etiquette furniture style of speech etc adopted in a society for the time being People have to cut their hair eat clothe themselves decorate their homesfashion affects how they do these things According to the French historian Fernand Braudel fashion affects everything It covers ideas as much as costume the current phrase as much as the coquettish gesture the manner of receiving at table the care taken in sealing a letter There is no reason to think that architecture is immuneIf style is the language of architecture fashion represents the wideand swirlingcultural currents that shape and direct that language Gothic architecture originated in France in the twelfth century and remained in fashion in Europe for the next three hundred years It was used in the great cathedrals and in such secular masterpieces as the Doges Palace in Venice and the Westminster Hall in London One of the last great Italian Gothic buildings was Milan Cathedral begun in  It was so large that the domical vault and crossing were not built until  years later by the great architect Filippo Brunelleschi By then the Renaissance was well under way thanks to Brunelleschis Foundling Hospital in Florence generally considered the first building designed in the revived Classical style With the rediscovery of Greek and Roman Classicism Gothic became distinctly unfashionable The old monuments were preserved but they were not admired A fantastical and licentious manner of building is how Christopher Wren characterized Gothic architecture So general was the dissatisfaction that Gothic came to stand for anything that was considered wild barbarous or crudeIn the mideighteenth century the term Gothic reappeared not in architecture but in literature The Gothic romance a type of novel was usually set in the medieval past and involved the fantastic and the supernatural Jane Austens heroine in Northanger Abbey is a devotee of such books and spends many hours in the luxury of a raised restless and frightened imagination over the pages of Udolpho Austen is referring to Anne Radcliffes The Mysteries of Udolpho one of the most popular Gothic romances of the day whose setting is a mysterious castle in the Apennines Such surroundingsmonasteries dungeons castlesfigured prominently in Gothic tales ever since Horace Walpoles The Castle of Otranto which was published in  and is generally considered the first Gothic romanceIn her novel Austen pokes fun at the genre The abbey of the title is not a haunted ruin in Italy but a converted medieval building in Gloucestershire complete with modern fireplaces comfortable furniture and other domestic conveniences This is a reminder that by  when Northanger Abbey was written the Gothic fashion had embraced architecture Horace Walpole was responsible for that fashion too In the s he had begun a project to enlarge Strawberry Hill his Thamesside villa near London While his contemporaries built stately houses in a delicate Classical style that was popularized by Robert and James Adam the young Walpole who had an independent frame of mind looked elsewhere for inspiration He had been an undergraduate at Kings College Cambridge and admired its extraordinary Gothic chapel The exterior of his house was battlemented like a medieval castle The interior combined historicism with a playful eclecticism Motifs copied from medieval altar screens ornamented the roomsstained glass was used in windows and papiermch fanvaults covered the ceiling Walpoles extensive collection of historical and modern books paintings and curiosities was also mixed inWalpole the Fourth Earl of Orford spent his entire life enlarging his house He eventually added a cloister a gallery and a tower As he was an author and a public figure who corresponded with a wide circle of literary and artistic friends throughout Europe the Gothic design of Strawberry Hill became famous among connoisseurs It also became a tourist attraction much to Walpoles chagrin Architects and their clients now saw medieval buildings as sources of inspiration just as they had once looked to ancient Greece and Rome The Gothic style became an established alternative for building country houses and pointed arches appeared in dcor and furniture Gothic was in againThe revived interest in the Middle Ages was complicated for fashion is rarely onedimensional Gothic meant different things to different people sometimes different things to the same people Spooky Gothic novels appealed to readers Medieval buildings appealed to the current taste for the romantic and the picturesque Goethes  essay on Strassburg Cathedral pointed the way he admitted to being a sworn enemy of the tangled arbitrariness of Gothick ornament but found himself overcome by the grandeur and mystery of the building which he described as a most sublime widearching Tree of God The French architectural theorist Eugne ViolletleDuc on the other hand was attracted by what he interpreted as the rationalism of Gothic construction So was his English counterpart George Gilbert Scott who considered Gothic more modern than Classical architecture hence a more appropriate model for architects Augustus Welby Pugin who worked on the British Houses of Parliament saw a moral dimension to Gothic He considered medieval architecture to be the ideal of Christian civilization much as Greece and Rome had been admired as the cradle of classicalbut pagancivilization John Ruskin too considered Gothic a moral force but since he also loved Venice polychrome Ruskinian Gothic has many Italian overtones This incongruity is particularly striking since in England especially but also in France and Germany the Gothic style was considered a homegrown productas opposed to Mediterranean Classicism This was another cultural appeal of Gothic at a time of growing nationalism in northern Europe it conveniently provided a national styleIn North America Gothic was if anything even more popular Canadians chose a British architect and the Gothic style for their Houses of Parliament which stand on a dramatic bluff overlooking the Ottawa River Anglophile Americans built Collegiate Gothic campuses Gothic parish churches and a Gothic National Cathedral in Washington DC Ralph Adams Cram who was devoted to High Gothic built the nave and west front of New York Citys Cathedral Church of St John the Divine the largest Gothic structure in the world Crams partner Bertram Goodhue used a looser Gothic style in the military academy at West Point as did Cass Gilbert in the Woolworth Buildingthe socalled Cathedral of Commerce By then the cultural attributes of Gothic had worn thin Hoods Chicago Tribune Building completed in  was one of the last prominent buildings designed in the Gothic styleGothic has notso farcome back into fashion Early in his career Paul Rudolph designed a building for Wellesley College that attempted to relate architecturally to the Collegiate Gothic surroundings It was his first large commission and it was not a success Wellesley shook me Rudolph later recalled and I returned to the International Style in my next building Eero Saarinen built a Gothicized dormitory at Vasser Philip Johnson and John Burgee designed a Gothicinspired skyscraper in Pittsburgh that was a giant abstracted glass version of the British Houses of Parliament This was one of several stylistic forays that Johnson and Burgee made in the s including a Chippendaletop skyscraper in New York a French Provincial highrise in Dallas and a neoBurnhamesque tower in Chicago None is particularly satisfactory perhaps because they lack conviction Moshe Safdies National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa is more successful It mimics the Gothic chapter housecumlibrary of the adjacent parliament buildings in a crystalline structure of steel and glass This episode in Safdies oeuvre was unique however and Gothicized forms do not reappear in his later buildingsThe Classical style has proved more durable This has something to do with its remarkable adaptability Whether building an administrative center for the British Raj or designing a station for the Pennsylvania Railroad workable solutions can be devised in the Classical tradition The cultural overtones of the Classical style are even richer than those of Gothic they include not only the ancient civilizations of Greece and Rome but also Renaissance Italian humanism seventeenthcentury Parisian splendor Georgian London elegance and English countryhouse comfort During the immediate postwar period monumental Classical buildings also acquired authoritarian associations since they had been fashionable in Nazi Germany and Stalinist Soviet Union If Gothic was considered a national style by some English architects in the s Classicism rooted in the early days of the Republic has a claim to being Americas national style This is most evident in Washington DC Except for brief flirtations with Victorian Gothic the Smithsonian and functionalist modernism the Air and Space Museum Classicism has remained in fashion for federal buildings ever since the construction of the Palladian White House Washingtonian Classicism has taken many guises ranging from the Jefferson Memorial a small version of the Pantheon to the severely abstract Federal Reserve Board Building The Federal Triangle and the recent Ronald W Reagan Building are modern interpretations of the Classical traditionWhile the architecture of federal Washington sometimes overwhelms foreign visitors it is comfortably familiar to most Americans because of the popularity of a simplified version of Classicismthe socalled American Colonial style which could more accurately be called American Georgian In furnishings dcor and above all in house design this has been the dominant domestic fashion for the last hundred years The origin of American Colonial can be dated with some accuracy January  was the inaugural issue of The New York Sketchbook of Architecture It was edited by a youthful Charles McKim The purpose of the publication McKim wrote was to document in sketches and photographs the beautiful quaint and picturesque features which belong to so many buildings now almost disregarded of our Colonial and Revolutionary Period McKim and his new partners William Mead and Stanford White made several sketching trips in New England They were designers not preservationists and their interest was the inspiration found in old buildings White clapboard walls black shutters and pedimented porches started to appear in McKim Mead  White houses The  Centennial celebrations made the American public aware of its ancestral past On a practical level the understated comfortable Colonial style was wellsuited to prevailing domestic taste It was also easilyand inexpensivelyadapted to small houses American Colonial remained the height of fashion until the s In a simplified formthe Cape Cod cottageit reappeared in postwar Levittowns It continues today although the clapboard siding may be vinyl the columns polystyrene and the stamped metal shutters more likely symbolic than realThe Tribune and Radiator Buildings are both in the vertical style or what is called Gothic simply because I happened to make them so Raymond Hood once flippantly explained If at the time of designing them I had been under the spell of Italian campaniles or Chinese pagodas I suppose the resulting compositions would have been horizontal  Hood was no more comfortable discussing style than other architects He left unexplained the question of what had put him under the spell of Gothic in the first place It had happened early Hoods senior thesis at MIThe later also studied at the Ecolehad been a church in the Gothic style his first employer was the Gothicist Ralph Adams Cram and Hood assisted Bertram Goodhue on West Point Later in life Hood occasionally returned to the Gothic style notably in the handsome Masonic Temple and Scottish Rite Cathedral in Scranton Pennsylvania but he never explained what broke the spell and led him to a more abstract styleLike any successful architect Hood had a strong sense of his changing time It is easy to misunderstand the nature of that change The abstraction that characterizes the Daily News Building and the RCA Building has little to do with new technology or changing functions Those buildings are not any more modern than the Chicago Tribune tower which had gargoyles and flying buttresses but was an advanced building in terms of planning and technology Indeed Hoods Gothic design was more functionally advanced than Eliel Saarinens stylistically progressive secondplace entry It was not commodity and firmness that drove the changing aesthetic but fashion The public had a taste for simpler forwardlooking design of which the International Style was but one expression Art Deco streamlined modern and stripped Classicism were evidence of the same changing taste Many industrial products of the s displayed the same chic simplicity Raymond Loewys curvilinear Coldspot refrigerator Walter Dorwin Teagues popular Kodak Brownie camera Henry Dreyfuss Bell telephone Loewys redesigned CocaCola bottle and the sleek Zippo cigarette lighterThe medieval inventors of the Gothic style were likewise influenced by fashion In the twelfth century European cathedral builders abandoned the triedandtrue round arch in favor of the pointed arch This change cannot be explained by functional or structural requirements since the pointed arch provides only marginal structural advantages and roundarch technology is perfectly capable of building tall naves as Durham Cathedral and other magnificent Romanesque churches demonstrate Cathedral builders obviously found something delightful in the pointed arch which they used not only as a structural form but in window tracery in wood paneling and even in choirstall furniture and liturgical accessories Gothic was seized upon as essential not because it was materially essential but because the pointed arch struck that note of fantasy which was what the mind of the age desired explains John Summerson It willfully destroyed the discipline of the round arch which had become an incubus and a bore A note of fantasy A bore At this point the eminent architectural historian sounds like a Harpers Bazaar fashion criticArchitectural reputations as well as architecture come under fashions sway Hood Ely Jacques Kahn and Ralph Walker the architect of the Irving Trust Building on Wall Street all small men were dubbed the Three Little Napoleons of Architecture by The New Yorker Riding high in the s their careers were cut short by the DepressionHoods more so since he died in  only  years old Rockefeller Center continued to be admired by the public but because of his freewheeling approach to design Hood was marginalized by modernist architectural historians He was never forgiven for winning the Chicago Tribune competition and beating not only Saarinen but such European avantgardists as Adolf Loos Bruno Taut and even Walter Gropius the founder of the Bauhaus and the guiding light of the International Style Yet if I compare Hoods RCA Building with Gropiuss Pan Am today MetLife Building there is little doubt who was the more creative designerLooking at that monolith bestriding Park Avenue without charm or grace it is easy to forget that Gropius was once considered one of the great architects of the twentieth century Architectural memory can be fickle Thomas Ustick Walter is not a household name but it should behe was the architect of the US Capitol dome probably one of the most powerful symbols of American democracy The Lincoln Memorial designed by Henry Bacon is another famous architectural icon Bacon died in  only two years after the memorial was dedicated so he did not see the Classicism that he had learned at McKims knee slip out of fashion At least Walter and Bacon were feted during their lifetimes Edward Durrell Stone an International Style wunderkind developed an unfashionable interest in decoration at a time when architectural austerity was in vogue And although he received large commissions including the Kennedy Center for the Arts he finished his career ignored if not actually ridiculed In the mids Paul Rudolph was probably the most promising young architect in the country His robustly monumental Art and Architecture Building at Yale where he was also chairman reinvigorated postwar American architecture A decade later heroic monumentalism was out and Postmodernism was in Although Rudolph continued to receive commissions in Asia he was slighted in his own country His contemporaries Gordon Bunshaft and Kevin Roche were awarded the Pritzker Prize but Rudolph was passed over By the time he died in  he was virtually forgottenYet Rudolph a gifted designer may be admitted to the architectural pantheon one day Architectural reputations can rise and fall and rise again The nineteenthcentury Philadelphia architect Frank Furness designed Ruskinian Gothic buildings whose lively eclecticism anticipates James Stirling Furness an exceptional individual who won a Congressional Medal of Honor during the Civil War dominated the Philadelphia architectural scene for  years In  he completed the University of Pennsylvania Library a widely acclaimed brick and terracotta building with a dramatic fourstoryhigh reading room After the turnofthecentury with Classicism all the rage Furness idiosyncratic brand of architecture became unfashionable Although he lived until  his practice languished In time he was entirely forgotten many of his buildings were demolished others insensitively altered As for the library its tall reading room was crudely truncated by a suspended ceiling In the s there was a revival of interest in Furness which narrowly saved the library from demolition Today after a careful restoration the library is unquestionably the bestloved building on the University of Pennsylvania campussomething about the spiky decoration and the willfully manipulated forms appeals to current sensibility Furness has found an audience againThe fate of Rudolph and Furness is a reminder that although architecture is susceptible to fashion architects are not fashion designers I do not design a new architecture every Monday morning Mies van der Rohe is reputed to have said This is often taken as a reflection of his serious commitment to his art It was that but it was something else too He might as well have said I cannot design a new architecture every Monday morning The Seagram Building is a masterpiece not because Mies had a sudden inspiration but because he had spent decades learning how to bring commodity firmness and delight into his particular version of balance how to attach the travertine to the wall to create a particular effect which metal fabricator could make a certain kind of handrail and exactly how deep to make a window mullion to cast the right size of shadow Buildings are extremely complicated artifacts and the time necessary to cultivate and refine a particular manner of building cannot be underestimated This is especially true when the manner of building is personal or unusual as it was in the case of both Furness and Rudolph They were not simply being stubborn or highminded when they refused to adapt to changing fashions they were being realisticMorris Lapidus is an architect who has lived long enough to see architectural fashions come full circle In the s Lapidus designed many of the largest hotels in the Miami area the Fontainebleau the Americana the Eden Roc His flamboyant eclectic designs were ridiculed by the architectural establishment although they were popular with the public Today in a period of socalled entertainment architecture when the worlds most celebrated architects design theme parks and casinos Lapidus seems less like a maverick than a pioneer The father of us all Philip Johnson called him with only slight exaggerationArchitecture changes at a bewildering pace Consider only the last  years of museum design The National Gallery of Art  in Washington DC and the Museum of Modern Art  in New York City are almost exact contemporaries In the MoMA design Philip L Goodwin and Edward Durrell Stone ignored the Classical tradition represented by John Russell Popes masterpiece MoMAs entrance was not up a broad flight of exterior steps but through a revolving door Goodwin and Stone replaced the monumental rotunda by a nondescript lobby the lofty galleries by lowceilinged loft spaces and limestone and marble by stucco and plasterboard MoMA was to be the last word in avantgarde International Style but it was scarcely finished when it was challenged by Frank Lloyd Wrights Guggenheim Museum  which rejected the banality of the white box by squeezing the entire museum into a dramatic sculptural spiral Nothing could be further from the International Style than the mollusklike exterior especially if it had been tinted rosered as Wright initially wanted In the Yale Center for British Art  Louis I Kahn likewise incorporated central skylit spaces but he disavowed Wrights loud antiurban exterior by hugging the sidewalk and clothing his building in drab stainless steel panels Kahn preached taming technology by consigning it to socalled servant spaces in the Centre Georges Pompidou  Piano and Rogers stood Kahns dictum on its head and gave the servants the run of the house In the Neue Staatsgalerie  James Stirling cheekily lifted architectural elements from both the Pompidou and the Guggenheim and combined them with a variety of historical styles I M Peis impeccably crafted East Building of the National Gallery of Art  in Washington DC had not one exposed bolt not one allusion to the past Pei rejected both Stirlings eclecticism and Piano and Rogers technological posturing Instead he relied on abstract geometry for architectural effect Frank O Gehrys California Aerospace Museum  in Los Angeles is no less abstract and geometrical but his forms bump and grind into each other almost as if by accident I really enjoy the awkwardness with which the forms touch Gehry observed as it reminds me of the cities we live in and the kind of awkwardnesses of city buildings sitting next to each other The cost of the East Building was  million the Aerospace Museum was built on a tight budget of only  million Lacking money for refinement Gehry turned awkwardness into a virtue and in the process disowned Peis fastidious brand of modernism He was carefree where Pei was careful spontaneous where Pei was studied brash where Pei was genteel The Aerospace Museum was clearly not a cheaper version of the East Building it was something differentFashion is also a search for a new language to discredit the old writes Fernand Braudel a way in which each generation can repudiate its immediate predecessor and distinguish itself from it This puts fashion in the right light it may be fleeting but it is not frivolous As Braudel suggests changes in fashion imply not only the creation of something new but the destruction of something old That is why new fashions are inevitably upsetting Whether one is wearing a loungesuit instead of a frock coat or turning a baseball cap backwards someone else is bound to be insulted No less so in architecture Replacing an Ionic column with a steel Ibeam or exposing airconditioning ducts or using common materials in uncommon ways are calculated affronts to honored conventions We are not like our fathers the architects say we are different
