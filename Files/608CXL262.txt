 Dear Philanthropy is the rent we pay for the joy and privilege we have for our space on this earth Jerold Panas I can only hope that you know how appreciative we at the Indianapolis Zoo are of your philanthropy Indeed your history of support of the Lowell Nussbaum Society pays much more than your rent It pays for the care feeding and housing of the thousands of plants and animals at the Zoo Your support has made so many things possible As a Nussbaum member you have helped us save endangered animals and their homes And you have helped us educate children and adults on the importance of caring for this earth our home Thank you for paying the rent I hope you will renew your membership in the Lowell Nussbaum Society and indeed increase your gift to increased amount this year We need your continued faith involvement and support as we strive to make the Indianapolis Zoo a place where animals plants and people are connected Connected to each other and to you Thank you again Most sincerely Meg Gammage Tucker Ph D Director of Institutional Advancement enclosures MGT ewc
