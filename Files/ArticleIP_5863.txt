 D Amatoing D Amato NEW ROCHELLE N Y OCT 27 Depending on which high minded pundit you listen to you know that the Senate race between incumbent Republican Al D Amato and Rep Chuck Schumer is either 1 the dirtiest or 2 the ugliest campaign in New York s history It is a campaign after all in which the challenger s slogan is Too many lies for too long where each candidate blithely runs ads accusing his opponent of coddling child pornographers and where virtually the only intelligible sentences of the so called debates were Stop being rude and Let me finish Right thinking New Yorkers and there are far too many of them agree This Senate race is a perversion of democracy The goo goos have it wrong This race has done exactly what a campaign should expose the candidates in all their nakedness Newspapers and commentators solemnly observe that this riot of negative ads and name calling has cost 40 million roughly 25 million from D Amato and the Republican Party the balance from Schumer and the Democrats That s about 2 for every New Yorker A few weeks ago Slate s Steven E Landsburg wrote a column arguing that every American has got 15 cents worth of entertainment from the 40 million Ken Starr investigation Well if there are any New Yorkers who haven t got 2 worth of diversion out of the Schumer D Amato race I haven t met them Schumer is stumping today with Hillary Clinton This is fitting because Schumer would like everyone to believe that Clintonism is the core of his campaign The Brooklyn representative has spent the last few years doing what Bill Clinton did before his presidential run shaking off a mostly liberal record and repositioning himself as a moderate who understands suburban voters Schumer abandoned his opposition to the death penalty voted for the Defense of Marriage Act and signed on to every crime bill he could find At all his campaign appearances Schumer emphasizes that I am a tough on crime moderate Like Clinton he is counting on liberals to vote for him because they have nowhere else to go Schumer resembles Clinton in another way He takes credit for everything Schumer I learned from his past few days of campaign appearances is responsible for the national drop in crime the protection of Social Security and Medicare and the budget deal Thank you congressman His New York Democratic colleagues have coined the phrase to Schume It means to take credit for something that others have done But if Schumer is a Clinton on paper he certainly isn t in the flesh Today s appearance with the first lady at a New Rochelle senior center makes this glaringly obvious When Bill and Hillary Clinton appear together he radiates the warmth When Schumer and Hillary appear together she does Hillary is chatty and informal Schumer has all the charm of a lawnmower To a crowd of genial upbeat seniors Schumer serves vicious attacks on D Amato He fires off some good lines D Amato votes like a senator from Mississippi not a senator from New York and When the choice was between Newt Gingrich and seniors Al D Amato chose Newt Gingrich But the vitriol doesn t fit the mood When he s not flamethrowing he lectures He responds to one question from an 81 year old with an endless learned and cringingly dull discourse on health care financing Schumer is no fun He s a grind If he were a salesman you d buy the car just to get him to leave you alone Even his loyalists don t seem to like him much The half dozen elderly women I spoke to after the event all said the same thing Of course they would vote for Schumer but mostly because they hate D Amato Brief interruption for speculation about Hillary s peculiar behavior She clearly loathes D Amato and she makes a point of never referring to him by name She calls him only Chuck Schumer s opponent Here s the peculiarity She also never refers to Bill Clinton by name She calls him my husband or the president never Bill Does this have psychological significance Is she so angry that she won t say his name The lesson of the Schumer campaign is not that you need to be Clinton to beat D Amato given that the overbearing Schumer will never be Clinton The lesson of the Schumer campaign is that you need to be D Amato to beat D Amato Clintonism is relentlessness plus charm D Amatoism which is now Schumerism is just relentlessness and to hell with the charm My mother in law who lives in Schumer s congressional district and always votes for him says she s thinking of supporting D Amato this year He s a sleaze But he s good for the Jews Substitute gays or Irish or farmers or cancer victims or bankers for Jews and you begin to see Schumer s struggle Sen Pothole is the master of the ethnic pork barrel He shows up at Jewish gatherings wearing a yarmulke with Alfonse stitched on it He relies on We owe him to override voters distaste for his viciousness and basic amorality and for 18 years it has Schumer doesn t yet have the pull to imitate D Amato s pork barreling though he would if he could Schumer for example happily obeys Wall Street s bidding on the House Banking Committee in order to raise campaign funds So Schumer has done the next best thing which is to steal D Amato s campaign style In Schumer D Amato finally faces an opponent who s as hardheaded shameless and effective as he is Usually D Amato dictates a campaign and his opponent desperately plays defense Schumer has turned the tables on D Amato The first day after the Democratic primary Schumer unleashed Too many lies for too long ads More recently D Amato stupidly but innocently I think called Schumer a putzhead then denied having said it Putz is a Yiddish insult that literally means penis but in common usage means fool Schumer has managed to gin this into an ongoing controversy about D Amato s trustworthiness and to score major points with Jewish voters Since last week s murder of a New York abortion doctor Schumer s people have subtly tried to connect the anti abortion D Amato with the extremist right to lifers And every time D Amato has attacked Schumer has fired it back in his face D Amato tried to exploit the ill feelings between New York City and upstate He ran an ad upstate depicting Schumer as a New York City shark swimming up the Hudson Schumer immediately countered by running the D Amato commercial in New York City labeling it the ad Al D Amato doesn t want you to see D Amato s latest strategy to tar Schumer as a lazy part time congressman who skips votes seems to be backfiring as well Newspaper after newspaper has berated D Amato for this patently dishonest strategy noting that Schumer is probably the hardest working member of Congress Schumer like D Amato is aggressive opportunistic and unpleasant in more ways that I care to discover But there is a fundamental difference between them D Amato is the minence grise or perhaps the minence noire of the corrupt Nassau County Republican machine He believes that politics is about bending the rules for cronies and campaign contributors and he has been implicated in more gross behavior than almost any politician around Schumer is clean He doesn t cheat He may have moderated his views to win but he is mostly principled and mostly honest Even so out D Amatoing D Amato on the campaign trail may not be enough Some signs are promising for Schumer A week out the polls are dead even and actually seem to be trending slightly in Schumer s favor D Amato has been distracted by Putzgate and Schumer is getting sweet PR off Hillary s visit and the president s planned campaign appearance Friday But it s hard to imagine that D Amato will lose He has saved his war chest He and the GOP will spend 8 million on an ad blitz during the five days leading up to the election Schumer has saved only a small fraction of that You can be sure that the D Amato ads will be cheap and distorted but that at least something from them will stick to Schumer Every article about Schumer notes that he has never lost an election But neither has D Amato Recent Campaign 98 Dispatches The Gambling Gamble South Carolina s Democrats Bet the Farm Foghorn Leghorn Meets an Owl Sen Fritz Hollings vs Rep Bob Inglis posted
