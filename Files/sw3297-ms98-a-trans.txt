        credit cards is one of my  wonderful topics um do you have quite a few or         i got rid of mine about uh oh its been about four years ago now   okay   and uh went on a strictly cash basis   uhhuh   and uh sometimes its inconvenient but   uhhuh   it is so much better for me   it is   because i i am the type that will always find an emergency   oh me too   but i have found that there were so many things that with a credit card you know i really did need   uhhuh   and with cash once you know it took me probably two years to get on a cash basis when i stopped charging   umhum   but once once i did you know it it only takes me two or three months to be able to save up what i want to buy   umhum   and im not paying the high interest rates   thats what kills you on those credit cards   because its so easy you know you have these wonderful intentions of well ill just pay off the whole balance and then i wont owe any   uhhuh   and then something comes up you know and well ill just pay the minimum well you just do that forever   umhum oh and and with the interest charge on the credit cards youre not getting anywhere because youre paying your interest every month and thats all youre doing   no youre paying interest   and with our Visa thats really high interest were in the process of transferring from one account to another to get the lower interest on one of the cards so that somehow we can get ahead on that but   you know ive ive thought about going ahead and getting something like American Express where you have to pay within thirty days   yes yes pay the balance at the end of the month umhum   right and just for ID purposes   umhum   but its become such a way of life   oh it has   and like i say it was so convenient and then pretty soon you get a consolidation loan   umhum   to consolidate all your credit cards and then they send you another credit card   umhum they i know like you paid that one off now heres another when really youre paying a loan for the other one   uh right so i i just finally figured out that for my way of life i did much better and ive ive been able to buy as much or more   umhum   by just going cash and like i say it was tough because its a really its a habit   umhum it is because you think oh ill get this and just pay it off later   or you know youll think okay ive got x amounts to spend this month and then somebody has a birthday or get they get married or something   umhum   you think well ill just put this one thing on it well you dont do that once you start you know youre going to have a bill coming in anyway   uhhuh no umhum might as well just yeah like you said theres a lot of things that i could probably do without that i dont do without because i have the credit card   right   you know and uh   and i i just you know for for me it was a trap that was too easy for me to get into   uhhuh yeah uh my husband and i just moved from South Dakota to um Plano Texas and uh that was the thing that helped helped us get down here and thats what were trying to get down on that because the credit card helped us move because we had just graduated from college and we felt that there was a lot of more opportunity down here and so it helped us out with the moving expenses   uhhuh   but um now were in the process of trying to get that down too but it it did help in that kind of a situation but um   well you know there are times when you know it is but i ive been laid off twice in the last four years and had i had a lot of credit cards   oh really youre youre stuck   i would well you know it it really helped that i didnt have that to pay for but in the other vein had i had them i would have lived on them   right umhum yeah because you didnt have any other income   right   yep   and uh this way you know i i made do   umhum   and uh when i was you know employed then i didnt have all that that i had to go back and say well ive got ten thousand dollars worth of credit cards to pay off now   right and that thats good thats a good feeling not to know   it really you know with the first like i say it took me over two years to pay mine off but the first time you know that i could go out and make a major purchase   uhhuh uhhuh and pay cash   and pay cash it was a real good feeling   i bet
