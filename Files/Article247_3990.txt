 What Is After Hours Trading When a Federal judge ruled last Friday evening that Microsoft had abused its monopoly power many reports noted that the company s stock price fell in after hours trading What is this It is simply the trading of stock after the markets close Traditional stock trading takes place during business hours because it involves a middleman the broker or trader who matches buyers with sellers That s what all those people shouting on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange do but they only work weekdays from 9 to 4 Eastern time In the past two years investors have begun to make trades without a middleman by using electronic communications networks or ECNs With computers making the matches ECNs such as Instinet MarketXT and Datek Island can extend their hours Many allow trades as late as 8 p m Eastern and at least one plans to offer 20 hour a day trading by the end of the year Theoretically they could allow trading around the clock Because after hours trading has yet to catch on with large numbers of investors the after hours and daytime markets can reflect different prices for the same stock A stock listed on only one exchange during the day say the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq can be traded after hours on any number of ECNs Since ECNs are not linked to one another a stock s price may vary from exchange to exchange And because so few transactions occur stock prices are much more volatile in after hours trading To prevent investors from getting badly burned after hours ECNs accept only limit orders bids in which the investor names the highest price at which he ll buy or lowest price at which he ll sell instead of the market orders in which the investor accepts the prevailing market price common during the day As trade volume increases though analysts expect that the daytime and after hours markets will converge Next question Explainer thanks Slate reader Steve Ruby for suggesting the topic
