 Background RNA polymerase II pol II transcription factor TFIID comprises the TATA binding protein TBP and a set of TBP associated factors TAF II s 1 2 3 At least 12 TAF II s have been identified in TFIID and cloning of their cDNAs has shown an evolutionary conservation of TAF II s from yeast to mammals 4 5 6 7 TAF II s are not only components of the TFIID complex but a subset of TAF II s are also found in the SAGA PCAF TFTC STAGA complexes which lack TBP 8 9 10 11 12 TAF II function in living cells has been studied in yeast where the use of temperature sensitive TS mutants has shown that many TAF II s are required for transcription of the majority of yeast genes 13 14 15 16 17 In contrast TS lesions in TAF II 145 TAF II 150 and TAF II 90 have a less dramatic effect affecting the expression of only a specific subset of genes mainly involved in the cell cycle 18 19 for reviews see 3 20 In mammalian cells a TS mutation in TAF II 250 shows that one of the functions of this protein is cell cycle regulation 21 22 23 24 Genetic experiments indicate that TAF II 30 is required for the viability of mouse F9 embryonal carcinoma cells as well as for their differentiation into parietal endoderm 25 In the absence of TAF II 30 undifferentiated F9 cells die through apoptosis but TAF II 30 is not required for survival of retinoic acid differentiated F9 cells Several studies have also focused on TAF II 135 TAF II 135 comprises 1083 amino acids and contains multiple functional domains At least four glutamine rich domains have been described Sp1 and CREB interact with distinct glutamine rich domains of TAF II 135 and TAF II 135 acts as a coactivator in vitro for these activators In transfected cells subdomains of TAF II 135 can act as dominant negative repressors of CREB activity 26 27 28 It has further been suggested that some neurodegenerative diseases may result from sequestration of TAF II 135 by expanded polyglutamine domains and consequent interference with CREB activity 29 TAF II 135 also contains two conserved regions CR I and CR II which are shared with the Drosophila homologue dTAF II 110 and mammalian TAF II 105 27 30 The CR II region is also shared with the yeast homologue yTAF II 48 31 32 and contains a histone fold domain required for heterodimerisation with hTAF II 20 yTAF II 68 33 34 The CR II domain plays an essential role in the ability of TAF II 135 to potentiate ligand dependent transactivation by the the receptor for all trans retinoic acid RAR in transfected mammalian cells 5 33 Aside from these studies little is known concerning the role of TAF II 135 in more physiological situations An increasing body of evidence indicates that targeted 26S proteasome mediated proteolysis of transcription factors is an integral part of the transactivation process There is a very tight relationship between the potency of activation domains and their stability 35 36 37 38 Activation domains and sequences required for degradation overlap and mutations in the VP16 activation domain which impair its function result in enhanced protein stability 35 Similarly ligand dependent targeted proteolysis of several nuclear receptors has been observed 39 40 41 42 In the estrogen receptor the RAR and the RXR deletion of the helix H12 of the ligand binding domain which is essential for ligand dependent activation stabilises these proteins showing that proteolysis and transactivation are intimately linked 42 43 44 In the case of nuclear receptors their targeted proteolysis in the presence of ligand may be a mechanism for attenuating the physiological response to the ligand It has also been suggested that targeted proteolysis is a means of regulating other physiological responses such as signaling through STAT factors 45 and heat shock 46 Although targeted proteolysis of transcriptional activators has been investigated it is not known whether components of the basal transcription apparatus are subject to this type of regulation in response to physiological stimuli We show here that TBP and TAF II 135 are selectively depleted in extracts from T RA differentiated F9 cells and from differentiated C2C12 cells This depletion is due to the selective targeting of TBP and TAF II 135 for proteolytic degradation since depletion is blocked when cells are treated with proteasome inhibitors During F9 cell differentiation degradation of TBP and TAF II 135 is concomitant with that of the RAR 2 a critical activator in primitive endoderm differentiation These results reveal a novel pathway controlling the intracellular levels of these two TFIID components and show that in F9 cells RA not only induces targeted proteolysis of the RAR 2 but also of the basal transcription factors which mediate transcriptional activation We further show that stable ectopic expression of TAF II 135 in F9 cells delays the targeted degradation of endogenous TAF II 135 TBP and the RAR 2 in response to T RA The cells have an enhanced growth rate and their differentiation into primitive endoderm is impaired at an early stage but they readily differentiate into parietal endoderm Treatment of these cells with T RA also induces the appearance of a population of cells with an atypical elongated morphology distinct from that of the primitive endodermal cells which have not been previously documented with wild type F9 cells and which are resistant to differentiation with bt2cAMP Results TBP and TAF II135 are selectively depleted in extracts from T RA differentiated F9 cells F9 cells are a well characterised model for cellular differentiation In the presence of T RA F9 cells differentiate into primitive or visceral endoderm and into parietal endoderm in the presence of T RA and bt 2 cAMP 47 48 Differentiation is accompanied by growth inhibition characteristic changes in cell morphology targeted degradation of RAR 2 induction of marker genes and increased apoptosis To determine whether components of basal transcription factor TFIID were subject to regulation during F9 cell differentiation immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies against TBP and a number of TAF II s was used to monitor the levels of the respective proteins in differentiated cell extracts see Materials and Methods No significant changes in the levels of TAF II 100 TAF II 55 TAF II 20 TAF II 30 and TAF II 18 or the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II were observed between 3 and 10 days of T RA treatment Fig 1A lanes 1 6 and data not shown In striking contrast TAF II 135 and TBP were strongly and selectively depleted in extracts made from cells differentiated with T RA for more than 3 days Fig 1Alanes 1 2 and remained at low levels up until at least day 10 lanes 2 5 No such changes were observed in vehicle treated control cultures Fig 1A lanes 7 12 In these experiments TAF II 135 and TBP were detected using two different monoclonal antibodies directed against distinct epitopes see Materials and methods The relevant extracts from T RA treated cells were also analysed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue showing that there was no overall change in the protein profile Fig 1B Therefore there is a selective depletion of these two TFIID components in extracts from differentiating cells To evaluate the levels of TBP and TAF II 135 in extracts from primitive endodermal cells we performed titration experiments using serial dilutions of undifferentiated F9 cell extract Upon prolonged exposure TAF II 135 could still be detected in a 20 fold dilution of the F9 cell extract whereas it was virtually undetectable in extracts from day 7 differentiated cells Fig 1C lanes 1 5 compared with lane 6 Similarly TBP was readily detected in the 20 fold dilution of F9 cell extract while the levels detected in the differentiated cell extracts were significantly lower compare lanes 5 and 6 The above experiments were performed with total cell extracts made in the presence of 0 5 M KCl We also asked whether the depletion of TBP and TAF II 135 would be observed in nuclear extracts from differentiated F9 cells where the nuclei were extracted with 1 0 M KCl to ensure efficient protein extraction As observed in total cell extracts TAF II 135 and TBP were selectively depleted in nuclear extracts from differentiated cells Fig 1D TBP and TAF II 135 were strongly and selectively depleted in extracts from visceral endoderm differentiated F9 cells analogous to what was observed in primitive endodermal cells data not shown When F9 cells were treated with T RA and bt 2 cAMP to induce parietal endoderm differentiation a selective depletion of TBP and TAF II 135 also took place between day 3 and day 5 Fig 1Elanes 1 2 and 6 however TBP but not TAF II 135 reappeared in parietal endodermal cell extracts around day 9 lanes 4 5 Together the above results indicate that there is a specific regulation of TBP and TAF II 135 during F9 cell differentiation Depletion of TBP and TAF II135 is not observed in F9 cells which are refractory to T RA To determine whether the depletion of TBP and TAF II 135 was intimately linked to the differentiation process we examined the regulation of these proteins in mutant F9 cells with altered differentiation properties F9 cells in which the retinoid X receptor gene has been disrupted by homologous recombination RXR cells are impaired in their response to T RA 49 When these cells are treated with T RA the depletion of TBP and TAF II 135 observed in the cell extracts is delayed by almost 4 days and takes place only between days 7 and 9 rather than between days 3 and 5 in wild type cells Fig 2A while no such depletion is seen in extracts from vehicle treated cells Fig 2B In contrast no significant change in TBP and TAF II 135 is seen in extracts from T RA treated RXR RAR cells in which the RAR gene has also been disrupted 50 51 and which are known to be refractory to T RA induced differentiation Fig 2C Thus the selective depletion of TBP and TAF II 135 requires that the F9 cells respond at least partially to T RA but does not require full differentiation to take place Depletion of TBP and TAF II135 is due to targeted proteolytic degradation The depletion of TBP and TAF II 135 in extracts from day 3 10 T RA treated cells could result from transcriptional or post transcriptional events Semi quantitative reverse transcription PCR RT PCR experiments using exon specific oligonucleotide primers showed that there were no significant changes in the TAF II 135 or TBP mRNA levels during differentiation data not shown This suggests that disappearance of TBP and TAF II 135 in extracts from differentiated cells does not occur at the transcriptional level but rather results from a post transcriptional event The peptide aldehyde proteasome inhibitors MG132 and ALLN have previously been used to investigate the post transcriptional regulation of proteins during physiological processes 52 53 To determine whether the depletion of TAF II 135 and TBP observed in the extracts from late T RA treated F9 cells was due to their selective proteolysis we treated T RA differentiated cells with these inhibitors on days 3 4 5 6 and 7 After an overnight exposure extracts were prepared day 4 5 6 7 and 8 extracts in Figs 3Aand 3B In the absence of MG132 or ALLN TBP and TAF II 135 disappeared in the differentiated cell extracts middle panel Figs 3Aand 3Blanes 6 10 In contrast in the presence of the inhibitors both proteins were readily detected even at late times where they are normally not observed lanes 1 5 The levels were nevertheless lower than those detected in undifferentiated cell extracts The level of TAF II 55 which remains constant during differentiation is only mildly increased by the addition of MG132 or ALLN Figs 3Aand 3Blower panel lanes 1 5 and 6 10 The addition of MG132 or ALLN to non differentiated cells also resulted in only a small increase in TBP and TAF II 135 levels Figs 3Aand 3B top panel compare lanes 1 5 and 6 10 The above results indicate that when proteolysis is inhibited the depletion of TBP and TAF II 135 is no longer observed showing that it is due to T RA induced proteolytic degradation We also prepared extracts from differentiated cells where MG132 was added only at the time of extract preparation Extracts made in this way are a measure of the intracellular level of these proteins since synthesis and degradation are both stopped at the same time Comparison of the TBP and TAF II 135 levels in extracts from day 7 differentiated cells prepared in the presence of MG132 showed that they were indeed significantly reduced compared to undifferentiated cells or day 3 differentiated cells approximately 3 fold Fig 3C lanes 1 4 and 5 similar results were obtained in the presence of ALLN data not shown Nevertheless these proteins do not disappear completely as they do in the absence of MG132 lanes 2 3 Therefore the complete disappearance of these proteins seen in the absence of protease inhibitors indicates that there is further degradation in the extracts which exaggerates the differences between differentiated and undifferentiated cells Although less TBP could be immunopurified from the MG132 blocked differentiated cell extracts using the anti TBP antidody 2C1 when equal amounts of immunopurified TBP from differentiated and undifferentiated cells was loaded equivalent amonts of TAF II 135 were detected in the TFIIDs data not shown Thus while the overall level of TFIID is diminished through the reduction in TBP and TAF II 135 the relative stoichiometry of the remaining TFIID is not significantly altered The apparently larger decrease in TAF II 135 seen in Fig 3Cresults from the lower efficiency of the antibody see also Fig 1C Taken altogether the above results show that the intracellular level of TBP and TAF II 135 and consequently TFIID is significantly reduced in differentiated cells through T RA induced proteolytic degradation Coordinate degradation of TBP TAF II135 and the RARgamma2 receptor during F9 cell differentiation It has previously been shown that the RAR 2 is subject to degradation beginning 48 hours after T RA induced differentiation of F9 cells 42 To determine whether there is a coordinate degradation of RAR 2 TBP and TAF II 135 we examined extracts made at these early times After 24 hours of T RA treament the levels of RAR 2 TBP and TAF II 135 were unchanged Fig 3D lanes 1 2 However after 48 hours there was a T RA dependent reduction in the amount of RAR 2 and TBP and a significant shift in the electrophoretic mobility of TAF II 135 lanes 3 4 By 4 days the levels of all three proteins were strongly reduced lanes 5 6 These results indicate that the onset of degradation of TBP and TAF II 135 is concomitant with that of the RAR 2 suggesting that these events are interdependent Constitutive ectopic expression of TAF II135 impairs F9 cell primitive endoderm differentiation The above results show that the level of TAF II 135 and TBP is strictly controlled during the differentiation of F9 cells by a post transcriptional mechanism involving targeted proteolysis To test whether artificially increasing the level of TAF II 135 would affect the proper differentiation of F9 cells we established cell lines which constitutively express flag tagged versions of human TAF II 135 fTAF II 135 372 1083 and fTAF II 135 805 1083 see Materials and methods TAF II 135 372 1083 contains all the known functional domains but lacks an unconserved proline alanine rich region whereas TAF II 135 805 1083 comprises only the CR II region For fTAF II 135 372 1083 12 cell lines were examined and we chose two lines A and B since they expressed the highest levels of the fTAF II 135 protein Immunoblotting with an anti flag monoclonal antibody showed a significantly higher expression level in line A compared to line B Fig 4A lanes 1 2 This result is confirmed by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody 20TA which detects both the endogenous and ectopically expressed TAF II 135 proteins Figs 4Band 4C lane 1 In line A the level of the ectopically expressed protein is higher than that of the endogenous protein while in line B both the exogenous and the endogenous proteins are expressed at similar levels For fTAF II 135 805 1083 which contains only the conserved C terminal domain 8 cell lines were examined of which 3 expressed the fTAF II 135 protein Fig 6A Both of the cell lines expressing fTAF II 135 372 1083 showed an approximately 2 fold accelerated growth rate compared to wild type cells while no significant increase was seen in the fTAF II 135 805 1083 expressing cells Fig 4E and data not shown note that the apparent slowing of growth between day 8 and 10 for lines A and B is due to their reaching confluence We first verified whether treatment of these cells with T RA would lead to the depletion of the ectopically expressed TAF II 135 In line A both the ectopically expressed TAF II 135 and the endogenous TAF II 135 were depleted with the same kinetics Fig 4B lanes 1 5 TBP was also concomitantly depleted in these extracts and all three proteins were stabilised when cells were treated with MG132 lanes 6 8 Importantly however the disappearance of all three proteins was clearly delayed by 48 hours compared to wild type cells compare Figs 4Band Fig 1Aor Fig 3C In line B there was also coordinate disappearance of TBP and the exogenous and endogenous TAF II 135 Fig 4C although no obvious delay such as that seen in line A is observed In contrast no depletion of fTAF II 135 805 1083 was seen following T RA treatment while the endogenous TBP and TAF II 135 were depleted normally between days 3 and 5 Fig 6B and data not shown As the targeted proteolysis of TBP and TAF II 135 is linked to the differentiation process the delayed depletion in line A suggests that T RA induced differentiation may be perturbed Their differentiation was therefore compared to that of the wild type cells In wild type cells the degradation of RAR 2 begins at day 2 and the protein is strongly depleted from extracts made at day 3 Fig 4D lane 3 At later times low levels of only the unphosphorylated form of RAR 2 can be seen in the extracts lanes 4 6 In contrast in line A elevated levels of RAR 2 are observed even at day 5 Fig 4D lanes 3 4 In line B an intermediate situation is observed since high levels of RAR 2 are seen at day 3 which decrease by day 5 lanes 3 4 In all cases low levels of only the unphosphorylated RAR 2 are detected by days 7 9 lanes 5 6 These results indicate that proteolytic degradation of RAR 2 is delayed in lines A and B suggesting that an early event in the differentiation process has been perturbed Comparison of the growth rate of line A with that of wild type cells in the presence of T RA shows that line A is less sensitive to the anti proliferative effect of T RA than wild type however growth is eventually slowed compared to undifferentiated cells Fig 4E Line B also grows faster than wild type over the first 4 6 days but subsequently its growth slows and is considerably retarded compared to undifferentiated cells Fig 4E Together these observations show that line A is poorly sensitive to T RA induced growth arrest and retains an essentially undifferentiated morphology while growth of line B slows after 4 6 days of T RA treatment and morphological differentiation is retarded We determined whether fTAF II 135 372 1083 expression modified T RA induced apoptosis The proportion of early apoptotic cells in lines A B and wild type was determined by flow cytometry in the presence of propidium iodide and annexin V FITC 25 54 55 In wild type cells the proportion of early apoptotic cells increased from 13 in the absence of T RA to 26 after 5 days of T RA treatment Fig 5 In line A spontaneous apoptosis was lower than wild type 7 compared to 13 and only a mild increase 9 was seen by day 5 Fig 5 In line B spontaneous apoptosis was also lower than wild type 6 compared to 13 while in the presence of T RA the proportion rose to 16 Fig 5 Thus line A is resistant to T RA induced apoptosis while line B shows reduced sensitivity to T RA induced apoptosis Differentiation of lines A and B was further assessed from changes in cellular morphology 6 8 days after the addition of T RA wild type F9 cells adopt a typical flattened primitive endodermal morphology see upper panel of Fig 7 In contrast line A cells retain an essentially undifferentiated morphology even after 8 days of T RA treatment centre panel Fig 7 The differentiation of line A is severely impaired as the cells never adopt a differentiated morphology even after 10 12 days of RA treatment data not shown Similarly line B cells appear essentially undifferentiated after 6 days of T RA treatment lower panel Fig 7 After 8 days a fraction of the cells begin to adopt a primitive endodermal type morphology although the cells are much less flattened than wild type cells and the majority of the cells retain an undifferentiated morphology Fig 7 Only after 10 days of T RA treatment did the majority of the cells adopt a differentiated morphology data not shown F9 cell differentiation is characterised by the induction of different marker genes We used reverse transcription coupled PCR RT PCR to compare the induction of some of these genes in lines A and B with that observed in wild type cells The RAR 2 gene is a marker which is rapidly induced in wild type cells normally after 12 24 hours 49 50 51 56 In agreement with this the RAR 2 mRNA is fully induced by day 3 in wild type cells Expression persists until day 5 and decreases only by day 7 Fig 8A lanes 2 5 note that the small increase in lane 5 in this experiment is not reproducibly observed In contrast in lines A and B RAR 2 expression is weak at day 3 peaks only at day 5 and drops off by day 7 lanes 7 10 and 12 15 Thus induction of RAR 2 is severely retarded and transient in lines A and B In the same RNA samples constant expression levels of HPRT were observed in differentiated and undifferentiated cells In contrast to the RAR 2 gene induction of the collagen IV 1 and laminin B1 mRNAs was almost identical in the wild type and mutant cells Fig 8Band data not shown showing that the delay in induction is specific to RAR 2 After 6 days of T RA treatment bt 2 cAMP was added to induce parietal endoderm differentiation Addition of bt 2 cAMP induced the rapid appearance of rounded cells with typical parietal endoderm morphology for both the wild type cells and lines A and B Fig 9 Thus while primitive endoderm differentiation of lines A and B is impaired they readily differentiate into parietal endoderm In lines A and B we noticed after 6 8 days of T RA treatment the appearance of a novel cell type characterised by elongated tightly packed cells Fig 10A The morphology of these cells was completely different from those of undifferentiated or primitive endoderm cells Although the majority of the cell population differentiates when bt 2 cAMP is added to these cultures the elongated cells persisted even after several days of bt 2 cAMP treatment Fig 10B showing that these cells are refractory to the differentiating effect of bt 2 cAMP Cells with this atypical morphology were not observed when wild type cells or fTAF II 135 805 1083 expressing cells are differentiated either with T RA or T RA and bt 2 cAMP Therefore ectopic expression of fTAF II 135 372 1083 has induced a novel differentiation pathway leading to the appearance of atypical elongated cells Taken altogether the above results show that primitive endoderm differentiation of F9 cells is blocked in line A expressing the highest level of TAF II 135 372 1083 and is significantly retarded in line B cells which express lower levels of TAF II 135 372 1083 In contrast all three fTAF II 135 805 1083 expressing cell lines and several control lines picked at the same time all showed a normal T RA response with respect to growth inhibition differentiated cell morphology and targeted depletion of TAF II 135 and TBP Fig 6Band data not shown TAF II135 and TBP are depleted in extracts from differentiated C2C12 cells To determine whether the down regulation of TBP and TAF II 135 is specific to F9 cell differentiation we asked whether this phenomenon could be observed in an unrelated cell type C2C12 are mouse skeletal muscle myoblasts which differentiate into multinucleated myotubes 57 This differentiation process does not require the addition of retinoic acid but takes place spontaneously when cultures are grown to high density and undergo growth arrest In extracts from differentiating C2C12 cells a progressive decrease in TAF II 135 and TBP can be seen beginning on day 6 such that these proteins are strongly depleted from the extracts by day 11 Fig 11A lanes 1 5 compare with lane 6 In contrast the levels of TAF II 55 remain constant Fig 11A The observed depletion of TBP and TAF II 135 was not observed when the cells on day 10 were treated with MG132 for 12 hours prior to extract preparation on day 11 Fig 11B lanes 1 3 These results indicate that TBP and TAF II 135 are also targetted for proteolytic degradation during C2C12 cell differentiation Discussion Post transcriptional regulation of TAF II135 and TBP in differentiated F9 cells We show here that targeted proteolysis of TBP and TAF II 135 is an integral part of the T RA response in F9 cells This process is specific for TBP and TAF II 135 as it is not observed with the other TFIID components analysed and is induced concomitantly with that of the RAR 2 In F9 cells with constitutive ectopic expression of TAF II 135 targeted degradation is delayed primitive endodermal differentiation is impaired and a novel differentiation pathway is induced Hence targeted degradation of TAF II 135 and TBP is a prerequisite for proper F9 celll differentiation TAF II 135 and TBP progressively disappear from whole cell or nuclear extracts made from T RA differentiated F9 cells This depletion does not result from altered transcription of these genes since no significant changes in the corresponding mRNA levels were observed during differentiation In lines A and B the ectopic expression of f TAF II 135 is driven by a synthetic promoter yet coordinate depletion of the exogenous and endogenous TAF II 135 is observed further confirming that this is indeed a post transcriptional event In contrast TBP and TAF II 135 are readily detected in extracts made from differentiated cells treated with MG132 ALLN and the proteasome specific inhibitor lactacystin our unpublished data showing that their disappearance is due to selective proteolysis In the presence of the inhibitors the detected levels are significantly lower than those seen in equivalent extracts made from undifferentiated cells Addition of the protease inhibitors only during the extraction procedure is another way to measure of the intracellular level of TBP and TAF II 135 In these extracts also the levels of TBP and TAF II 135 are significantly reduced in differentiated cells compared with undifferentiated cells Therefore the intracellular levels of TBP and TAF II 135 and consequently TFIID are reduced in differentiated cells through selective proteolysis Targeted degradation of TAF II 135 does not require amino acids 1 372 since deletion mutant 372 1083 is targeted along with the endogenous protein in lines A and B In contrast mutant 805 1083 is not degraded during differentiation indicating that the sequences required for targeting are located between amino acids 372 805 Many of proteins which are targeted for proteolytic degradation contain signal sequences such as PEST or cyclin destruction boxes which mediate their proteolysis however no recognised destabilising motifs are present in TBP and TAF II 135 and indeed these proteins are stable in non differentiated F9 cells and in many other cell types It will therefore be interesting to identify the sequences are required for degradation of TBP and TAF II 135 in differentiating F9 cells In this respect we note that we have not been able to recover F9 cell lines significantly overexpressing TBP suggesting that TBP overexpression is toxic In F9 cells RAR 2 plays a key role in primitive endoderm differentiation 58 59 48 hours after addition of T RA degradation of this protein begins such that by 3 4 days most of the protein is depleted 42 The onset of RAR 2 degradation coincides with that of TBP and TAF II 135 suggesting that these events are causaly related This idea is supported by the fact that in line A degradation of TBP TAF II 135 and RAR 2 are all delayed to similar extents A lesser delay in degradation of RAR 2 in line B was also observed If the corresponding delay in TBP and TAF II 135 degradation in line B was less than two days it would be missed since we prepared extracts at two day intervals All of these observations are consistent with the idea that upon exposure to T RA there is an early transcriptional response in which a RAR 2 RXR heterodimer activates genes required for differentiation As a consequence the RAR 2 and the TAF II 135 and TBP components of the basal transcription machinery are down regulated through proteolytic degradation It has been suggested that degradation of the RAR 2 or the ER is a means of regulating the cellular response to these ligands both in terms of magnitude and time 42 44 The coordinate degradation of RAR 2 TBP and TAF II 135 in response to T RA indicates that the cellular T RA response is not only regulated through degradation of the activator but also through degradation of components of the basal transcription machinery The differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes does not require T RA but is induced by growth inhibition and serum starvation Despite the important differences between these cells and F9 cells targeted degradation of TBP and TAF II 135 is also observed when C2C12 cells differentiate Hence targeted degradation can be induced by stimuli other than T RA Our report is the first showing that basal transcription factors can be regulated in this way in response to different physiological stimuli As described in the Introduction recent studies indicate that the activation process is linked to targeted proteolysis of transcriptional activators In the case of the RAR 2 degradation requires a constitutive phosphorylation of the AF 1 domain heterodimerisation with RXR and the presence of ligand indicating that the receptor has to be transcriptionally active to be degraded 42 Under these conditions the receptor is ubiquitinated and degraded While we have not been able to directly detect ubiquitination of TBP or TAF II 135 in extracts where ubiquitination of RAR 2 can be detected our unpublished data at early times we do observe a significant shift in the electrophoretic mobility of TAF II 135 which may correspond to a polyubiquitinated intermediate While the molecular events involved in degradation of transcription factors are in general poorly understood it is noteworthy that both NRs and TBP have been reported to interact with the proteasome component SUG1 60 61 which may act to target these proteins for degradation In addition other components of the proteasome ubiquitin degradation pathway have also been shown to interact with either nuclear receptors or components of the preinitiation complex for review see 38 Further experiments will be required to determine whether TBP and TAF II 135 are modified directly to allow targeting or whether they are targeted indirectly through the formation of transcriptionally active complexes with the RAR 2 which as it is itself degraded acts to recruit the degradation machinery A decreased level of TBP in differentiated F9 cells has previously been noted 62 63 These studies did not address the mechanism underlying its down regulation but they revealed a down regulation of the pol III TAF BRF and the pol I TAF I 48 and TAF I 95 proteins and diminished transcription by the corresponding polymerases in T RA differentiated F9 cells In the light of the present study it is possible that the BRF TAF I 48 and TAF I 95 proteins are also post transcriptionally down regulated by targeted proteolysis in the same way as TBP and TAF II 135 This pathway may therefore be used to more generally regulate the activity of all three RNA polymerases during differentiation TAF II135 plays a key role in F9 cell growth and differentiation We show here that T RA induced primitive endoderm differentiation is impaired in cell lines constitutively expressing ectopic TAF II 135 372 1083 as judged from retarded targeted degradation of RAR 2 cell morphology growth inhibition apoptotic response and induction of the RAR 2 marker gene The effects are most pronounced in line A cells which express the highest level of ectopic TAF II 135 and do not show a differentiated cell morphology even upon prolonged exposure to T RA An intermediate but significant effect is seen using all criteria tested in line B cells where fTAF II 135 372 1083 expression is lower In contrast cells expressing fTAF II 135 805 1083 differentiate normally The RAR 2 gene is normally fully induced by 12 24 hours 56 and elevated expression persists up until day 5 In lines A and B induction was seen only after 5 days and this induction was transient compared to wild type cells As the RAR 2 gene is important for T RA induced growth arrest 64 its delayed induction in lines A and B may in part explain the phenotype of these cells Nevertheless the collagen IV 1 and laminin B1 genes as well as several other known marker genes our unpublished data are induced normally in lines A and B by day 3 5 even when no obvious morphological differentiation is observed This differential induction of the RAR 2 versus other marker genes has not been previously noted in the various RAR and RXR knock out cell lines analysed The phenotype generated by ectopic TAF II 135 expression is therefore distinct from that seen in these knock out cell lines Most of the currently identified marker genes are not appropriate for the analysis of the phenotype of these lines A detailed understanding of how ectopically expressed TAF II 135 blocks primitive endoderm differentiation will require the identification of novel marker genes whose expression is significantly altered in lines A and B and which may be directly regulated by TAF II 135 Despite the fact that primitive endoderm differentiation of these lines is perturbed they differentiate normally into parietal endoderm This shows that in contrast to what has previously been assumed differentiation into parietal endoderm does not require the cells to first be fully differentiated into primitive endoderm since line A cells go from an essentially undifferentiated morphology to a parietal morphology However even line A is not totally refractory to T RA since several marker genes are induced and they have become bt 2 cAMP responsive Again the phenotype of these cells is not the same as that of the RXR RAR cells where none of these events take place Our results rather indicate that ectopic TAF II 135 expression acts at an early stage to impair primitive endoderm differentiation but does not prevent the T RA induced changes which render the cells bt 2 cAMP responsive The initial elevated TAF II 135 expression in lines A and B impairs both the T RA transcriptional response and its associated degradation of RAR 2 TBP and TAF II 135 prolonging the period of elevated expression of these proteins resulting in a subsequent block of primitive endoderm differentiation It has previously been shown that phosphorylation of the RAR 2 AF 1 is indispensable for primitive endoderm differentiation 59 When F9 cells expressing the RAR 2 in which the phosphorylation site has been mutated are treated with T RA no degradation of this protein is observed There is therefore an intimate relationship between differentiation and RAR 2 degradation suggesting that proper RAR 2 degradation is essential for differentiation 42 This idea is supported by our present results since we show that TAF II 135 overexpression impairs both RAR 2 degradation and primitive endoderm differentiation It is therefore probable that the increased stability of the RAR 2 in lines A and B is the major cause of their impaired primitive endoderm differentiation It is interesting to note that the TAF II 135 805 1083 deletion mutant is not degraded in response to T RA and its expression does not interfere with differentiation This suggests that TAF II 135 is only targeted for degradation if it contributes functionally to the T RA response The severity of the phenotype observed in lines A and B correlates with the expression level of the exogenous f TAF II 135 372 1083 protein a version of TAF II 135 in which the N terminal proline alanine rich region has been deleted The deleted region is not conserved in hTAF II 105 and dTAF II 110 is not involved in interactions with other TAF II s SP1 or CREB 26 27 33 and has no known function In agreement with this the fTAF II 135 372 1083 and the fTAF II 135 805 1083 protein can be coprecipitated with the endogenous TFIID of lines A and B our unpublished data It is likely therefore that the phenotype of lines A and B results from the TAF II 135 overexpression per se although we cannot exclude the possibility that the effects are not due only to the elevated expression levels but that they may additionally reflect a dominant negative property of this mutant Investigation of this has been hampered by the fact that we have not been able to isolate F9 cell lines stabley expressing full length TAF II 135 Treatment of lines A and B with T RA induces a fraction of the cells to adopt an atypical elongated cell morphology which to our knowledge has not been previously seen upon differentiation of F9 cells Unlike the other cells in the population these cells do not differentiate into parietal endoderm showing that they are refractory to bt 2 cAMP These observations suggest that ectopic TAF II 135 expression promotes T RA induction of genes which are normally not activated in F9 cells leading to a novel differentiation pathway It is also possible that TAF II 135 expression modulates the activity of transcription factors in addition to the RARs leading to the appearance of this novel cell type Conclusions We report for the first time that components of the basal transcription machinery are subject to regulation by targeted proteolysis in response to a physiological stimulus Our results point to a critical role of TAF II 135 in F9 cell physiology It is downregulated during F9 cell differentiation and expression of TAF II 135 at elevated levels promotes cell growth impairs the normal T RA response and induces a novel differentiation pathway Materials and methods F9 and C2C12 cell culture and differentiation Wild type and mutant F9 cells were grown as described 25 49 Differentiation was induced by addition of 1 0 M all trans retinoic acid T RA with or without 250 M di butaryl bt 2 cAMP In most experiments an appropriate number of 10 cm plates were seeded with 10 5cells and after 24 hours day 0 T RA was added and protein or RNA extracts were made from one plate of cells on each of the indicated days Stably transformed cell lines were isolated by electroporating plasmid pXJ fTAF II 135 372 1083 along with the puromycin resistance gene under the control of the SV40 promoter Puromycin resistant cell clones were selected in the presence of 1 g ml
