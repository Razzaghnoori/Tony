 Background Breast cancer is the most common cancer excluding non malignant skin melanomas and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the US 1 During the 1990s the observed incidence of female breast cancers increased and was accompanied by a significant decrease in breast cancer mortality 2 Both trends may be due in part to the increased utilization of mammography 3 From 1989 to 1997 the percentage of women aged 40 years who reported ever had a mammogram increased from 63 9 to 84 8 3 4 However there was a substantial difference between those who were ever screened and the proportion of women screened in the previous 2 years 84 8 v 71 3 1997 4 Relative to areas of higher population density areas of lower population density have been noted to have increased breast cancer incidence 5 and breast cancer mortality 6 Rural women were also less likely than their urban counterparts to have received a mammogram 7 This difference was attributable to disparities in education level household income and health insurance coverage Rural women were also less likely than urban women to have a recent mammogram or clinical breast exam CBE 8 Conversely a recent qualitative study reported that rural women had higher rates of mammography and CBE than their urban and suburban counterparts 9 Providers of primary care services play a critical role in determining patient compliance with preventive services through direct recommendations to their patients 10 11 12 Women who were off schedule for regular mammograms were significantly less likely to have a regular physician and to have received a physician recommendation for a mammogram than on schedule women 13 Another study of family physicians and general internists showed that 70 of women who received a provider referral completed a screening mammography within one year versus only 18 of self referred women 12 Over 90 of rural women report that a doctor s recommendation to have breast cancer screening is important 14 In the American Cancer Society s second survey of physician attitudes and practices in early cancer detection physicians reported that screening guidelines influenced their referrals for mammograms 15 It should be noted that multiple factors contribute to clinician compliance with guidelines including provider related guideline related patient related and environment related variables 16 Our study examined geographic location of practice to identify any variations in approaches to breast cancer screening among clinicians physicians nurse practitioners and physician assistants in primary care settings Methods Comprehensive surveys examining issue of cancer prevention and control were mailed to primary care physicians nurse practitioners and physician assistants n 1761 in an 8 county region of Western New York Primary care physicians included family physicians general practitioners general internists and obstetricians gynaecologists Mailing addresses were obtained from the provider directories of a major regional health maintenance organization HMO supplemented with mailing lists from the Nurse Practitioner Association of Western New York NPWNY and the Western New York Physician Assistants Association WNYPAA Western New York ranks among the top communities in the US for Health Maintenance Organization HMO penetrance For this reason essentially all primary care providers are included in HMO practitioner mailing lists 96 confirm this figure An initial mailing to primary care physicians and non physician providers nurse practitioners and physician assistants was performed in February 2001 followed by two additional mailings to non respondents at 4 week intervals The first follow up mailing was the same as the initial mailing and included an additional copy of the questionnaire The third mailing was a postcard reminding clinicians to return their surveys The survey consisted of 22 items eliciting information on clinician knowledge attitudes and behaviours concerning the delivery of general preventive and cancer screening services as well as personal and professional demographic information The survey was pre tested for content validity using a convenience sample of health care clinicians Responses to four multiple choice items were used to examine variation in breast cancer screening practices 1 At what age should an average risk woman initiate screening for breast cancer using clinical breast examination accepted answer 20 years 15 2 At what age should an average risk woman get a baseline mammogram accepted answer 35 years No current guidelines address this item although it was a prior recommendation of ACS it is not addressed in their current guidelines 3 At what age should an average risk woman begin having mammograms every 1 2 years accepted answer 40 years 15 17 18 19 4 At what age should an average risk woman begin yearly mammograms accepted answer 50 years 15 17 18 Since no single organization has issued breast cancer screening guidelines which address all of the four screening items we relied upon guidelines issued by several different organizations For example the American Academy of Family Physicians 18 20 and the 2 ndUnited States Preventive Services Task Force USPSTF advise mammography every 1 2 years for women aged 50 69 years 21 Since completion of data collection for this project the 3rd USPSTF released an updated statement advising mammography with or without clinical breast examination every 1 2 years for women aged 40 years and older 22 A summary index of beliefs about breast cancer screening was created by summing the total number of responses in agreement with these items values for this summary variable ranged between zero and four It is important to emphasize that the focus is not on correct versus incorrect responses but rather the variations among respondents For example if a large proportion of respondents indicate the same response to an item s this would indicate limited variation Demographic information collected on respondents included clinician age gender race ethnicity professional groups board certification specialty practice structure work schedule involvement with supervision of trainees and the zip code location of their clinical practice Using 2000 United States US Census figures and geographic land area in square miles the population density of each zip code area in Western New York was determined population square mile Calculated population densities were matched with the clinical practice site zip codes provided by survey respondents Practice site zip codes were then divided into urban rural and suburban categories The analysis is based on the location of each medical practice and not on the residence of the clinician or patients All zip codes identified within the major cities of WNY Buffalo or Niagara Falls were categorized as urban Each of these urban areas had population densities exceeding 1000 persons square mile persons mile 2 Communities surrounding Buffalo and Niagara Falls were identified as suburban if they were contiguous to these major cities and had population densities between 500 1000 persons mile 2 Although five zip code areas in Erie and Niagara Counties had population densities exceeding 1000 persons mile 2 Hamburg 1050 4 mile 2 East Amherst 1068 5 mile 2 North Tonawanda 1222 5 mile 2 Tonawanda 3027 8 mile 2 and Depew 3269 1 mile 2 they were classified as suburban areas for this study These areas are distinctly separate from the urban centers moreover these communities have higher socio economic status and are not burdened with the problems often associated with urban areas Based on these changes 17 clinicians were reclassified 4 17 428 The remaining zip code areas were categorized as rural if their population density was less than 500 persons mile 2 The majority of these communities are considered rural areas of Western New York WNY by local opinion However communities with total populations of 2500 persons or more were classified as suburban consistent with US Census criteria This re classification impacted Fredonia total population 10706 Olean 20976 Batavia 22924 Clarence 8391 Lockport 48859 Jamestown 49478 and Lewiston 12104 of clinician were reclassified Overall this process resulted in 59 of respondents classified as urban 18 as suburban and 23 as rural Chi square statistics were used to compare demographic and professional characteristics of respondents between the geographic categories Chi square analysis was also utilized to assess associations between responses to breast cancer screening items with independent variables such as specialty group and demographic characteristics age category gender etc Nonparametric tests were used to evaluate differences in age and the reported number of hours of continuing medical education credits CME as these variables were not normally distributed Odds ratios with 95 confidence intervals were used to compare summary scores for breast cancer screening and utilization of breast cancer screening guidelines among respondents within geographic categories In addition we used a multivariate logistic regression model to test whether geographic category represented an independent predictor of the summary score for breast cancer screening and use of written screening guidelines Results are presented as adjusted odds ratios and 95 confidence intervals SPSS 10 1 software SPSS Inc Chicago Ill was used for the analyses Results Completed surveys were returned by 469 clinicians yielding an overall response rate of 30 n 469 1582 179 surveys could not be delivered Nurse practitioners had a response rate of 47 n 199 424 which was significantly greater than that of primary care physicians 22 n 202 905 and physician assistants 27 n 68 253 Of these 469 respondents the following respondents were excluded from analysis 1 Persons reporting their clinical practice site outside of WNY n 9 2 Persons reporting less than one year in clinical practice n 26 3 Persons who did not self identify as residents trainees but reported that they were neither board eligible nor board certified n 1 4 Persons who did not report a practice site zip code n 5 Thus analyses were based upon responses from 428 practitioners 179 physicians 185 nurse practitioners and 64 physician assistants The majority of respondents reported practicing in urban areas 59 with a relatively equal distribution of respondents practicing in rural and suburban areas 23 and 18 respectively As summarized in Table 1 the suburban and urban respondents were more likely to be female Respondents did not differ by age or race Rural respondents were more likely to be physicians 54 whereas a large proportion of both suburban and urban respondents were either NPs or PAs Also more rural practitioners were board certified 78 compared to suburban and urban practitioners 59 and 60 respectively Urban practitioners were more likely to report being involved in the supervision of trainees 69 Among physician respondents family physicians or general practitioners were more likely to be located in rural areas 76 Figure 1summarizes responses to each of the individual breast cancer screening questions Agreement with correct responses ranged from 50 to 71 for the individual items Overall 50 agreed with 3 or more of the four breast cancer screening items Figure 2presents the distribution of scores for the summary index While no significant differences were noted by practise location variation is evident illustrating heterogeneity in responses As illustrated in Figure 3 the distribution of summary index scores differed by clinical group p 0 049 When groups of clinician were compared separately the distribution of scores differed only for physicians compared to nurse practitioners p 0 017 Overall about one half of respondents agreed with three or more of the four breast cancer screening items Table 2 There were significant differences between age tertiles with the 40 year old group 61 being more likely than the 50 year old group 34 to correctly answer 3 or more of these items Females 56 were more likely than males 39 to correctly answer three or more items p 0 001 Differences were also observed when the summary index was analysed by practice structure with only 30 4 of solo practitioners agreeing with three or more of the four breast screening questions There were no significant differences by geographic categories in the summary measure or when individual questions on breast cancer screening recommendations were compared As shown in Table 3 approximately 65 of all respondents reported use of some written breast cancer screening guideline Analysis of geographic variations in the reported use of written breast cancer guidelines after adjusting for age and professional designation physician nurse practitioner physician assistant revealed less use of guidelines in both suburban adjusted OR 0 51 95 CI 0 26 0 98 and urban areas adjusted OR 0 56 95 CI 0 33 0 97 when compared to rural areas Discussion While there were significant sociodemographic and practice related differences by geographic regions no significant variations were observed in the summary breast cancer screening index among urban suburban and rural areas These results are important in highlighting differences in how breast cancer screening is approached with agreement ranging from 50 to 71 for the individual breast screening items Moreover this group of primary care health professionals demonstrates marked variation in approaches to breast cancer screening since agreement with three or more of the four breast cancer screening statement was just 50 While this variation could be due to a variety of factors it is more likely that these differences reflect clinicians attempts to reconcile conflicting recommendations issued by various organizations We defined one accepted response to each item to serve as a basis from which to examine both dichotomous and polychotomous responses While others might debate which response category is acceptable the fact that responses are distributed across several categories is more noteworthy That is regardless of the category selected variation in responses is apparent It is worth mentioning that the response option which we designated as the accepted answer was generally observed to represent the modal response While a potential limitation of this study is the low response rate 30 it is comparable to the lower range of response rates of health care providers reported in a review article of this topic 23 Our study relied upon a passive response system without any financial inducements for completing a multi page mailed survey The response rates among the geographic regions surveyed were similar It is possible that clinicians working in non primary care settings and specialities with dual designations as primary care providers may have been less likely to complete the survey because it may have been perceived as outside their usual scope of practice Also the length of the survey may have contributed to a reduced number of responses We were not able to more fully explore sociodemographic and professional variations between respondents and non respondents due to limited baseline information beyond mailing addresses and practice location While these limitations may impact the generalizability of our study the comprehensive approach of including physicians PA and NPs in combination with the large number of respondents represent unique strengths The predominance of women among urban and suburban respondents may be due to the overrepresentation of nurse practitioners in these groups Urban providers were more likely to be involved in the supervision of trainees which is reflective of the locations of clinical training centers in urban centers of Western New York On the other hand rural providers were more likely to report their specialty as family or general practice This is consistent with a national trend of an increasing physician supply of family physicians general practitioners in rural communities 24 Interestingly rural providers were also more likely to be board certified than their urban and suburban peers The overrepresentation of both family physicians and nurse practitioners may account for this variation Another issue which is not addressed by these data is what clinicians think about the guidelines In other words it is not clear if the clinicians do not follow the guidelines because they are not familiar with them if they have reviewed the guidelines and don t agree with them or if they simply find conflicting guidelines to be confusing Guidelines for breast cancer screening are not uniform across organizations Despite the recent recommendation from the 3 rdUSPSTF advising mammography with or without clinical breast examination every 1 2 years for women ages 40 years and older 18 the issue of mammography among women age 40 49 remains under debate The practice of obtaining a baseline mammogram adopted by many primary care physicians in clinical practice does not appear in the guidelines of any major organization The source of these guidelines consulted for this paper and included the American Cancer Society the National Cancer Institute specialty societies and health insurance companies Conclusions This study suggests that primary care clinicians including physicians nurse practitioners and physician s assistants lack a consistent approach to breast cancer screening This lack of agreement does not appear to be impacted by geographic practice location but rather is likely a more global clinical issue The implications of this lack of consistency for individual patients or groups of patients are uncertain since it is unclear how differences in approaches to breast cancer screening translate into differences in clinical practice Application of an industrial perspective to reduce variation would suggest opportunities to develop a more consistent approach to how breast cancer screening is addressed in the primary care setting Development of an evidence based consensus statement regarding breast cancer screening with broad endorsement would support a single set of unambiguous guidelines for implementation across primary care settings
