 nope first one i ve had from California and where are you uh North Carolina uh huh well i guess the only people i ve talked to before were from Texas so i yeah mine me too and i had i was beginning to think that was the only people on the network yeah they all work for TI too well what do you uh what are your favorite television shows well first and foremost it s got to be LA Law LA Law yeah that s a very popular one around my office but i ve never seen it yeah never never have seen it my goodness it s hard to believe i didn t think there was anybody in the country who hadn t seen that one i well i can go even better than that i ve never seen Dallas either never never once gosh i admit that i used to be hooked on Dallas but back way long time ago when Jock died i gave up watching it it just got too funny well i think i just sort of uh didn t start watching it and then felt like i would have been way too late getting in on the action to figure out what was going on so i never did get involved in it well i think the writers had the same problem um hum yeah i mean they they went for an entire season with this and i m sure you heard about it all these things oh who killed JR all these things going on no this was i think it was before or after that oh but they went for this whole season and they had all these situations and then to end the season come to find out Pam it was all a dream oh yes yes i remember reading about that thinking uh i would have just strangled them you remember that i mean an and then oh i i tell you that just did it for me right there i said you ve put me through an entire season of Pam dreaming yes you know you writers are coming you know you re having a hard time here i think that s right i think they just lost their uh inspiration for a while well i understand that this is the last season for it yeah somebody said that uh JR is going to die and that will be end of the season forever i mean the end of the show forever uh i i read something in the paper yeah that s yeah they uh i read something in the paper today talking about or it was Parade magazine yesterday and they said you know when s the last episode and what s going to happen and they say insiders say JR is going to get knocked off well it s about time huh good about time too bad they didn t kill him the first time yeah too bad they didn t get away with it shoot um hum well anyway what s your favorites oh well i mostly watch public television so yeah i m one of those i uh no i i that s what i spend most of my time watching that uh well i love Masterpiece Theatre oh yeah and i love the mystery series yeah mystery especially uh Miss Marple oh yes oh i i ve i ve got all the videos that i can get my hands on of of Miss Marple oh yeah i love those i used to i i lived in England for about four years so it really brings back oh we uh huh some memories we have uh uh a local station uh on our cable network here that uh is showing all the Miss Marples over again so we got to repeat them it must be either uh A E or um uh Discovery Discovery i i think it is A E yeah A E runs quite a lot of them um i like Discovery Channel too i like they have lots of wildlife shows and um hum oh they do have some absolutely gorgeous things so uh but they uh the one we just watched that we had videotaped from the weekend was the Gardens of the World did you see that one this week yeah hum um no i missed it uh well nice i bet we are lucky enough to now be on a cable system that has four public TV channels um boy that is that is good so we get we get things over and over so if we miss them we can catch them later and that Gardens of the Worlds was absolutely glorious it was i bet it was uh Audrey Hepburn was narrating it um i like her and they took you all over uh oh i like that started in Italy went to England France some in America uh also Japan anyway it was a really a a visual treat um really nice i bet i bet yeah the interesting thing about public TV is it s not public around here you have to have cable to get it is that right um hum uh well uh silly when i was in Houston there was one station of just uh it was uh the University of Houston station um hum and uh so it had not all of the stuff that people in other parts of the country were getting because each station gets its own mix um hum but when i moved to California and all of a sudden i had this uh surfeit of public television um hum yeah we can get all sorts of things everything from i guess on Saturday there you can watch something like eight different cooking shows um hum so i don t but i could if i felt like it right yeah i i spend a lot of time down in Charlotte uh and on their just the the regular TV not cable you can pick up four PB or three PBS channels um hum but uh the closest one to Raleigh is in uh Chapel Hill which is about twenty five miles away and believe it or not you can t pick it up really i would have thought that was close enough that yeah it was it should be close enough but i guess they have the antennas pointing it the other way or something or you got a hill between you or something like that bu t yeah it s uh it just you can barely see the picture and you can t hear anything so well the only about the only things i watch on commercial television are Thirty Something and Twin Peaks uh and i just discovered that they uh have have canceled both of those so oh really yeah i ve i ve never seen either one of them well let me tell you that Twin Peaks was much better when it just started so maybe it s time for it to quit i they ve gone downhill too oh well i guess there were i guess it was pretty popular because there was quite a lot of Twin Peak conversation well the thing i liked about it was that it was so unconventional that you couldn t predict what was coming next well at least that that s what i like about a show if if you can predict it it s not worth watching that s right and this one had all sorts of weird little things and would go off in uh strange directions and it had lots of uh little subtle touches that if you weren t watching you would miss uh that they d have references to literature and things like that and they d also just have odd thing they walk into a bank vault and there is a deer head lying on the table in the bank vault um and there s no explanation for it they treat it as perfectly normal and somebody says what s the deer head doing here and they said oh it fell off the wall so why was it doing on the wall and in one case the fellow was making coffee and they said there s a fish in the coffee pot well i suspect that that s a reference to Thoreau s Fish in the Bucket of Milk but i don t know for sure and i m not sure what the relevance would be if it were but sounds like a pretty good show i m sorry sorry i missed anyway it had a lot of things like that thing to make you keep watching just for the novelty and the surprise of it sorry i missed that one you know i i don t watch very much TV i i watch um LA Law um hum and i watch Sixty Minutes um hum and America s Funniest Home Videos um and that s about it well they and i watch the i sometimes watch the the news yeah i d say probably what i watch the most faithfully is the news which i really don t watch as much as i just listen to it yeah back well when i had cable i used to just keep it on CNN not to watch it but just to have it in the background because i d always listen to it when i m fixing dinner or something like that it s i uh at least know if there s anything i want to read thoroughly in the newspaper um hum i get the headlines off the television right yeah the uh cable prices are just too high nowadays and i m not going to i i just won t pay that that kind of money for for what i m getting i mean i miss A E and i miss Discovery and i miss CNN but that s it yeah um hum uh and it just it just wasn t worth it just to get those three uh we just about had to get it because the reception in our particular locality was so poor um hum that we could only get about three stations and uh only one was a public station and we had a yeah San Francisco station and a San Jose station but neither one of them was very clear they were both um hum barely adequate yeah well so we decided when the cable came through that we would get on it just so we could see what we were watching if we watched anything at all right yeah i d i d probably i d probably get cable but i ve got we got the the three networks and two local stations and that fulfills my needs because i don t watch TV that much anyway anymore anyway um hum yeah i think i would be inclined to do the same thing if we could see anything without the cable yeah yeah i know what you mean course like i say the only thing i do miss is PBS because i there several things on there i like Masterpiece Theatre Mystery uh huh especially those yeah uh Masterpiece Theatre is really good they have had some absolutely wonderful shows and they do they have incredibly good what are called production values they have yeah and and you yeah really well researched uh locations and sets and costumes and so forth and as far as i can tell on places where i have some knowledge their historical research is excellent um hum yeah
