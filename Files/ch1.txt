the look of architectureonedressing upArchitecture is hard to define Goethe called it music frozen in space which while it captures a sense of rhythm is too onedimensional And it relegates the mother of the arts to an inferior position just as well to describe music as melted architecture Nietzsche believed that architecture reflected his pride mans triumph over gravity and his will to power This notion applies to many buildings from Gothic cathedrals to skyscrapers but it is too well Nietzschean The British master Edwin Lutyens referred to architecture as a sort of play In architecture Palladio is the game Le Corbusier described his art as the masterly correct and magnificent play of masses brought together in light which is a good description of one of his own buildings I am partial to Sir Henry Wottons definition Wotton who lived a long time in Venice and was a lover of architecture though not an architect published a treatise on the subject in  In Architecture as in all other Operative Arts the end must direct the Operation he wrote The end is to build well Wellbuilding hath three conditions Commoditie Firmeness and DelightSir Henrys description which was based on the writings of the Roman architect Vitruvius appeals to me because it emphasizes the complexity of the building art To begin with architecture has not one but three distinct purposes to shelter human activity commodity to durably challenge gravity and the elements firmness and to be an object of beauty delight Architecture is always a synthesis of the three However the fulfillment of one purpose does not guarantee the satisfaction of the others There are homely sturdy buildings and beautiful flimsy ones A wellplanned building can be ugly just as a beautiful building can function poorly Form does not contrary to Louis Sullivans hoary maxim follow functionNot only are function and form separate over their long lives buildings can successfully accommodate a variety of uses For example some of the most famous museums the Louvre the Hermitage the Belvedere started life as royal palaces the Uffizi in Florence is so named because it originally housed offices and the Prado in Madrid was designed to be a museum of science not art The acclaimed Muse dOrsay in Paris is housed in a railroad station Two of my favorite small museums the Frick Collection in New York City and the Phillips Collection in Washington DC were built as residences As historic preservation and adaptive reuse demonstrate you can shop in a renovated warehouse do office work in a converted loft or live in a barn Assuming of course that the warehouse the loft and the barn were well built The material fabric of old buildingsthe heavy beams rough brick walls and solid woodworkis one of their chief pleasures That is why we feel cheated by hollow walls flimsy doors and shaky balustrades Buildings should last and feel as though they willOne might assume that just as the highestrated carsMercedesBenz BMW Lexusrepresent the highest standards of automobile technology the most admired architecture would be the best built This was generally true in the past but in the twentieth century when new materials and new aesthetic theories often have driven architects to cavalier experimentation even celebrated architects have fallen short in that department Le Corbusiers white suburban villas for example were crudely finished in cement plaster on top of brick and since the architect usually ignored for aesthetic reasons intrusive metal flashing and coping strips the crude machines for living often aged poorly Some Frank Lloyd Wright buildings have leaky skylights sagging overhangs and defective heating systems This does not make them any less delightful to visit but it must make them considerably less delightful to inhabit Perhaps the most dramatic example of failed experimentation in recent years is the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris which opened in  The building was widely praised for its architectural innovationthe British periodical Architectural Design called it a seminal building of the Modern Movement The architects Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers turned the building literally insideout They dramatically hung pipes ducts fire stairs elevators and escalators from the exterior structure These previously hidden elements were now exposed in plain sightand exposed to the elements The result might have been foreseen after only twenty years the French government was obliged to close the building for a twoyear renovation Although the authorities maintained that the renovation was required because of the unexpectedly large number of visitors according to Le Monde almost half of the  million budget was spent on refurbishing the faadeThe University of Pennsylvania where I teach is the site of Louis I Kahns A N Richards Medical Research Laboratory This structural tourdeforce of precast concrete and brick brought its designer international acclaim I remember traveling from Montreal to Philadelphia as a student to see the building a few years after it was built My classmates and I particularly admired the exposed concrete structure and the explicit separation of what Kahn called servant and served spacesmassive brick ventilation shafts and delicate glassenclosed individual laboratories However The latter proved to be unpopular with their occupants The large windows let in too much light today most are papered over with aluminum foil cement dust from the exposed concrete beams falls on the lab tables and the rigid plan has proved inflexible to changing needsThe Richards Laboratory was built only  years ago It is next to a student dormitory known as the Quad a picturesque Jacobean Revival complex planned around a series of courtyards This handsome building has been doing yeoman service for almost a century The Quad was designed by the Philadelphia firm of Walter Cope and John Stewardson whose work at the University of Pennsylvania Princeton and Bryn Mawr was largely responsible for the popularity of socalled Collegiate Gothic Pleasing welllovedand wellbuiltthe Quad is architecture of the highest order Yet my classmates and I did not pay any attention to the dormitory when we visited Philadelphia years ago We had never heard of Cope  Stewardson despite their achievements and wide cultural influence The architecture historians whom we studiedSiegfried Giedion Nikolaus Pevsner James Marston Fitchfavored innovators and experimenters even if the innovations and experiments often failed Put another way most historians of modern architecture gave precedence to Delight over Commoditie and Firmeness This may be because the appearance of a building was easier to assess especially at a distance than either its functional performance or material durability Or maybe they were attracted chiefly to the aesthetic qualities of architecture In any case imaginative inventive and revolutionary were more likely accolades to be showered on important buildings than accommodating dependable and soundThis is not to say that good architecture is merely utilitarian One of the grandest spaces in Philadelphia is the concourse of Thirtieth Street Station which was built in  for the Pennsylvania Railroad by the accomplished Chicago architects Graham Anderson Probst  White the successor firm of Daniel H Burnham The magnificent room  feet long and almost  feet high is covered by a flat coffered ceiling decorated in red gold and cream Diffused light streams in from tall windows on both sides Almost nothing in this memorable spacethe gilded Art Deco chandeliers the travertine walls the massive Corinthian columns at each endwas a product of its rather mundane function to provide a waiting space for people before they descended the staircases that led to the platforms below But the railroad station concourse in the heyday of railroad travel was more than merely a place to get on and off trains It was a gateway to the city as well as a symbol of unreserved faith in modern transportationand in the Pennsylvania Railroad That is why it was appropriate for delight to take precedence over commodityYet delight is not uniform The Main Concourse of Grand Central Terminal in New York City for example offers different pleasures than Thirtieth Street Station The monumental spaces are comparable in size and function They are both well built Similar spaces similar materials yet the experience of the two concourses is different Both buildings are inspired by the Classical architecture of the past but Grand Central which opened in  is a modified version of BeauxArts Classicism whereas the Philadelphia station despite the Corinthian columns is simplified abstracted and stylized what historians called stripped Classicism As a result Grand Central is dramatic visually rich in its details almost Wagnerian Thirtieth Street is equally dramatic but in a way that is coolly geometrical and sleekly urbanenot Wagner Cole Porter Style is evident in the smallest details It ensures a continuity between the great vaulted sky of Grand Central and the ticket counters or between the Thirtieth Street chandeliers and the announcement boards at each track stair It is the visual language of a building Architectural style is the manner in which the architect communicates a particular kind of visual delight in large ways and smallCommodity firmness and delight are never evenly weighted Sometimes one predominates sometimes the other Sometimes a waiting room needs to be a triumphal celebration of arrival and departuresometimes it is just a waiting room Sometimes it is necessary to compromise structural simplicity to achieve an esthetic effect Sometimes functional requirements override other considerations a laboratory that does not serve its scientists is a failed work of architecture no matter how beautiful its design A banal church is a greater failure than a banal factory The art of building requires judiciously balancing Wottons three conditionsThe end must direct the operation That is what distinguishes architecture from the fine arts of painting and sculpture An artist can paint square wheels Paul Klee once observed but an architect must make them round Architecture in this respect is no different than other operative arts such as cooking The creativity of the chef is likewise circumscribed by factors outside his controlthe natural ingredients the human palate the chemistry of foods The dish must be at once nourishing commodity cookable firmness and of course tasty delight It should also look good although the contemporary trend toward visually extravagant dishes seems to me an aberration The art of cooking like the art of architecture lies in knowing how to establish the appropriate relations between the three conditionsThe experience of food is sensual It is also firsthand That is while its fun to read recipes and look at photographs of table settings in Gourmet magazine no one I know considers this a substitute for eating The experience of buildings is sensual too Yet many of us get our first glimpses of buildingsparticularly celebrated buildingsas images in books magazines newspapers public lectures and exhibitions One of the most famous buildings of the Modern movement Ludwig Mies van der Rohes Barcelona Pavilion was known almost entirely through photographs since it was built for an exhibition that lasted only seven months Before photography the Paimio Tubercolosis Sanatorium located in a remote part of Finland would have remained obscure as it was its stunning images brought the young Alvar Aalto worldwide recognition The Sydney Opera House is another worldfamous building that at least outside Australia relatively few people have seen firsthand Yet photography tells us very little about how a building fulfills its function or about how it is built For example the handrails in the oftenphotographed stairway of the Paimio sanatorium look like standard International Style metal pipes In fact they are woodmuch more pleasant to the touchpainted to look like metal Wellknown photographs of the Barcelona Pavilion show eight freestanding columns supporting a flat slab and freestanding marble screens that carry no loads a prototypical International Style structure In reality there are columns concealed within the screens which are not slabs of marble but thin marble sheets attached to a masonry backup wall In other words this  building is an example of traditional layered construction not of modernistic structural purismIn photographs buildings are forever young The ravages of time weather and use are banished It is a shock to come across a revered architectural icon and to find the concrete stained the painted window frames chipped the tiles cracked Of course all buildings age but some age more gracefully than others A yearold Palladio villa retains its beauty despite peeling plaster and mossy stonework perhaps it even looks more enchanting Most modern buildings on the other hand lose their potency if they are not gleaming and machinelikeObviously photography highlights the visual qualities of buildings and ignores commodity and firmness Yet photography cannot completely communicate delight A visitor to the Seagram Building in New York for example is surprised to discover the subtle relationship between Mies bronze tower and the Italian Renaissance faade of McKim Mead  Whites Racquet and Tennis Club on the other side of Park Avenue Equally deceptive are photographs of Frank Lloyd Wrights work in Oak Park since they give no hint of the comfortable suburban surroundings of his socalled prairie houses As I student I studied the buildings of Le Corbusier in black and white photographs which did not prepare me for the shock of experiencing his often wildly polychrome interiors Nor can photography communicate movement which is such an integral part of the architectural experience film is better at this but not much Nothing conveys the actual experience of a building like the real thing To paraphrase Robert Hughes a photograph of architecture is to architecture as telephone sex is to sexNever is modern architectural photography more misleading than in its portrayal of domestic interiors Interiors are usually photographed empty or with minimal furnishings before the owners have had the opportunity to move in and presumably defile the purity of the design But even if the space is occupied strict conventions prevail furniture must be lined up just so there must be no distractions no halfempty tea cups no crumpled newspapers no abandoned childrens toys Books on shelves are arranged to create interesting patterns personal mementos are temporarily banishedeverything must be neat I once observed a photographers assistant during a photo shoot comb out the fringe of a rug Such primping and visual editing sets off the architecture to best advantage It alsonot coincidentallygives the impression that the designed interior is autonomous and selfcontained in other words that it is a work of art Markedly these photographs never include human figures People would be the greatest distraction of allThe world of buildings depicted in books and magazines is a scaleless selfsufficient place The absence of people in architectural photographs has several effects In the past the proportions and dimensions of buildings were based on the human body While this was done for philosophical reasons it also ensured a direct relationship between architecture and peopleit is why even very large Classical buildings feel comfortable By removing people from buildings architectural photography makes it possible to regard architecture as an abstraction unrelated to humans It is not merely that the conventions of modern architectural photography ideally communicate the intentions of most modern architects it is also that they validate those intentions People Who needs themWhile I was writing Home I discovered that the most useful historical sources for information about how people furnished and decorated their homes were often paintings Not paintings in which the room was the subject but portraits and domestic genre scenes An example of the latter is James Tissots Hide and Seek which shows four little girls at play in a Victorian sitting room The dcor is exotic an eclectic mixture of Persian rugs Chinese porcelain pots and tigerskins and others furs scattered over the furnitureTissot was a French painter who settled in London in  An easel in the corner suggests that this is his own house in which case the woman sunk deep into an easy chair reading a newspaper may be his Irish mistress John Singer Sargents masterpiece The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit painted in  likewise shows four girls Henry James described it as the happy playworld of a family of charming children but the girls can hardly be said to be playing Properly dressed in white pinafores black socks and patent leather shoes they form a motionless tableau The room in an apartment in Paris is stylishly bare unadorned except for two immense Japanese vases and a red screen The mood is entirely different in the Swedish painter Carl Larssons playful Mothers and the Cherubs Room which was included in Larssons famous book Ett Hem At Home published in  The walls of his wifes bedroom are wooden boards whitewashed and decorated with a painted frieze of ribboned garlands the ceiling likewise wood is painted green with red trim The simple furniture is also painted in bright colors Karin Larssons bed is separated from the childrens cots by a striped woven curtain We see three of the Larsson girls in various stages of dressand undress That is appropriate too for naturalism and artlessness permeate this charming sceneSuch paintings are more faithful depictions of domestic surroundings than modern architectural photographs For one thing they are full of the signs of everyday life A coat is thrown casually over a chair there are crumbs on the table Tissots little girl playing on the floor rumples the carpet Moreover in these interiors the architecture is in the background It is a setting for human activityjust as it is in real life Paintings also convey something about the atmosphere of the interior Dutch seventeenthcentury domestic paintings for example exude a prosperous air of bourgeois comfort and propriety A hundred years later Franois Boucher painted a middleclass French family gathering for morning coffee in a little room with japanned woodwork and gilded moldings There is a sweet intimacy here that is absent in the Dutch interiors An interior of the same period by Henry Walton shows an English gentleman at breakfast He is sitting in a relaxed posture wearing a ridingcoat and boots accompanied by his dog The ambience is one of informal and relaxed country lifeAs I studied such paintings I started to see associations between the rooms and their inhabitants The legs of the mahogany furniture in an English country house were as straight and unadorned as their owners riding boots The arabesques and curlicues of the moldings and architectural ornaments in a French salon mirrored the flouncing ribbons that adorned the womens dresses and the frills of the mens shirts The proper black broadcloth and white lace collars of the Dutch men and women echoed the spotless blackandwhite checkerboard marble floors I became convinced that a strong connection exists between the way that we decorate our homes and the way that we dress ourselvesThere are three distinct reasons for the intimate relationship between dress and dcor The first is technical Dcor like dress incorporates fabrics Curtains swags and windowtreatments are made of silk damask satin brocade wool muslin and velvetso is clothing Woven materials are used in tapestries wallhangings carpets and upholstery as well as coats and skirts Inevitably the dressmakers techniques of embroidering gathering pleating and trimming find their way into dcor This is why furniture skirts recall womens skirts and why the fringes cords and bobbins of nineteenthcentury drapery recall ladies ballgowns The delicate lace curtains and the billowing baldachin over a bed in a ladies boudoir matched the clothes in her dressing roomThe connection between dcor and dress can be even more intimate for architecture sometimes directly mimics dress The garlands in eighteenthcentury buildings are sculpted or painted versions of the sashes and flowered ornaments worn by men and women The ancient Greeks incorporated elements of dress in temple architecture This is most apparent in colonnades which Vincent Scully has likened to hoplites massed in a phalanx There is no doubt that Classical columns were given human attributes Ancient authors likened the vertical flutes to the folds in a chiton or tunic Columns have capitalsthat is heads The moldings of Doric capitals were sometimes painted to resemble headbands Ionic and Corinthian capitals incorporated carved head garlands and the curving tendrils of Corinthian capitals often look more like hair than foliage Indeed Vitruvius considered the Corinthian order feminine as opposed to the sturdy masculine Doric Sir Henry Wotton went so far as to call the Corinthian order lascivious and decked like a wanton courtesanThe second connection between dress and dcor is social In the s the famous English economist Alfred Marshall observed that as people earned more money they wanted better food better clothes and larger homesboth for social standing and comfort Since homes and clothes are timeworn ways in which to convey status there is a conformity in the types of materials and symbols used to convey social standing If family coats of arms are displayed they will be seen on wall medallions as well as on blazer buttons If gold is treasured the wealthy will wear gold braid and surround themselves with gilt moldings If this is considered too flashy other materials can convey status stainless steel kitchen appliances and stainless steel watch bracelets Diamonds may be forever but fashions change Today leather is considered a luxury material and is used both for expensive clothing and expensive sofas A hundred years ago leather was considered utilitarian leather aprons and vests were worn only by workmen and leather easy chairs were only found in smoking rooms and mens clubs since leather was less flammable than fabric But it was never used in salons or drawing rooms When corduroy originally used only in workingmens dress became accepted by the middle class it also showed up as upholstery The current fashion for natural dress fabricscotton wool linenhas a counterpart in natural dcor exposed brick oiled wood polished concreteIn a more general senseand this has nothing to do with conspicuous consumptionboth homes and clothes convey values Carl Larssons home was a statement of both his and Karins naturalistic aesthetic ideals so was James Tissots exotic sitting room Whether or not we are artists our homes like our clothes communicate who we are or at least how we wish others to perceive us starchly formal or comfortably casual intensely avantgarde or resolutely traditional bohemian or conservative cosmopolitan or downhome The Che Guevara poster on the wall and the embroidered denim jacket convey one set of values Colonial breakfronts and penny loafers another That is why it is disconcerting if dress and dcor are not in harmony Sweat shirts and running shoes in a Louis Quinze drawing room send a decidedly mixed message as does a threepiece suit on the deck of a Malibu beach bungalowThe third connection between dress and dcor concerns perception Architecture interior decoration and fashion design are three distinct fields yet we experience them with the same eye Whether we look at dress or dcor we bring the same visual bias the same sensibility the same taste This sensibility is not constant Sometimes we appreciate simplicity sometimes complexity Fashionable seventeenthcentury French eyes for example favored floral decorations and embroidery and introduced the custom of having vases of fresh flowers in the home English eyes in the midst of the Neoclassic revival sought fundamental simplicity and sobriety in mens clothes as well as in architecture Victorian eyes fancied dense patterns that were likely to show up in waistcoats and on wainscotting Parisian eyes in the early s admired the same neoEmpire motifs in dress and dcorEarly twentiethcentury eyes had their own particular sensibility One of the great interiors of this period is the main living space of the Tugendhat House designed by Mies Van der Rohe in  The house stands outside Brno Czechoslovakia The exterior is a lowkey International Style white box but the interior is astonishing The public rooms are contained in one large open space A curved wall of macassar ebony defines the dining room and a straight freestanding wall of onyx dore separates the music room from the living room The space is punctuated by slender cruciform columns covered in chromed metal The east and south walls are floortoceiling glassa precursor of Mies famous glass house The sense of openness is heightened when at the touch of a button fifteenfoot sections of the glass wall sink into the groundI have never seen the Tugendhat House except in a handful of blackandwhite photographs the house was severely damaged during the Second World War This is another case where photographs are a poor substitute They do not convey the rich textures of the raw silk and velvet draperies nor the vivid colors of the upholstery emerald green leather and rubyred velvet Nor do they capture the sumptuous range of materials onyx pearwood handwoven wool chromed metal and surprisingly a linoleum floor Since the surviving photographs do not show any human figures they heighten the impression that the house was built yesterday especially as the furniture designed by the architect is still in productionMies van der Rohe appears in a photograph taken in  The place is Stuttgart the site of the famous Weissenhof housing exhibition which he planned and where he brought together the leading exponents of the soontobechristened International Style One of these was Le Corbusier who is also in the photograph The two firebrands who will soon set the architectural world on its ear are deep in conversation Le Corbusier smokes a pipe and sports a jaunty derby and a loose short tweed coat Mies looking older than his forty years wears a Homburg a long dark ulster and spats This photograph puts the Tugendhat House in context However modern the airy room appears to my eyes it contained a considered and formal way of life that is as remote from me as waxed moustaches Homburgs and spats It is in that context that Mies curious combination of ordered simplicity and sybaritic luxury must be understoodNothing could be less similar to the Tugendhat House than Charles Moores weekend house that he built for himself in the hills above Berkeley California I saw it in the summer of  two years after it was built While the Tugendhat House appears sexy and glamorous the Moore house is at first glance downright rustic a little barn twentysix feet square capped by a saddle roof It is an elegant little barn however with whitepainted walls and large windows that open up the corners not by disappearing into the ground but by sliding sideways like barn doors The oneroom interior contains a grand piano and a sunken bath that looks vaguely Roman perhaps because the skylight above it is supported by four solid fir Tuscan columns found by Moore at a demolition site Four similar columns support a second skylight over a sitting areaI admire the Tugendhat House but I could not imagine living in it That is I could not imagine having to dress up sufficiently to feel at home The Moore house on the other hand reflects a more compliant sensibility Its floortoceiling windows spare detailing and open interior mark it as a successor to the International Style Yet the shingled roof and the Tuscan columns hearken back to older traditions The little building manages to be comfortable relaxed archetypal and vaguely ironic all at the same time The eclectic Californian setting is both informal and formal Put another way it is a place where people who wear tweed jackets with jeans or silk skirts with canvas espadrilles would fit right inThe little Moore barn is an historic building Together with Robert Venturis Vanna Venturi House which was designed the same year it marks the advent of an architectural style that became known as Postmodernism One of the celebrated buildings of Postmodernism is James Stirlings Neue Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart which was completed in  Stirling vastly expands Moores eclecticism combining a bewildering mixture of forms a Doric portico a staid neoclassical wing that matches the existing museum an Egyptianlooking curved cornice a colorful Russian Constructivist entrance canopy a curving steelandglass wall and two huge blue ventilator funnels lifted straight from the Centre Georges Pompidou The monumental faade of alternating bands of travertine and sandstone is undermined by oversized fiberglass handrails that look like pink sausages I couldnt understand this design except as a tourdeforce until I visited the building It was a wintry Sunday and the Staatsgalerie was packedit is one of the most popular museums in Germany Now the architecture made sense This museumcumdiscotheque was the perfect setting for the eclectic crowd We were wearing every type of dress imaginable casual wear business suits ski parkas work clothes Some people dressed up for a Sunday visit to the museum some dressed down Stirlings lively collage absorbed us all I did not see any gentlemen in Homburgs and spats but they would have fitted in tooA number of years ago I accompanied the architect Jack Diamond on a visit to a building that he had just completed at York University in Toronto It was a student center containing a food court and lounges on the main level and student organization offices on the second floor The exterior of the building was decidedly traditional Facing a landscaped common the wellproportioned faade consisted of a colonnaded brick base supporting a row of double columns capped by a deep copperlined cornice Behind the colonnade which was fitted with retractable glass panels that could be opened during warm weather was a twostoryhigh hall lit by three large skylights The exterior had a simplicity that reminded me of McKim Mead  White albeit without Classical ornamentThe interior was different with many hallmarks of the International Style no decoration bare concrete exposed structural beams factory sash glazing and steel pipe railings I assumed that the stark simplicity was the result of a restricted budget and a desire to use materials that would withstand wear and tear It seemed pretty banal to me and although I didnt say anything to Jack I was disappointed Yet as we walked around I changed my mind Although the dcor was tough and unsentimental it was not crude There were sleek stainlesssteel pendant lighting fixtures with suspended glass diffusers and stylish easy chairs covered in canvas In the food court the bar and counter tops were marble the dining tables solid maple Students were gathered around tables lounging on the staircase sprawled on the floor The atmosphere was hard to pin down This was not the precious corporate modernism of Richard Meier nor the contrived technological wizardry of Norman Foster It was certainly not the Calvinist minimalism that I associated with many trendy younger architects I couldnt put my finger on it until I realized that the functional but chic dcor reminded me of the nononsense styling of a Benetton clothing storeI happen to like Collegiate Gothic buildings I like their dark rooms with wood paneling hammerbeam ceilings and traditional oak furniture But seeing the York student center made me realize that whenever I walk through these old buildings I also experience a nagging dissatisfaction It has to do with the students The young men and women in baseball caps shorts stenciled sweat shirts and iridescent nylon windbreakers just dont fit in They should be wearing boaters and blazers tweeds and flannels Of course no student that I have ever seenincluding at Oxforddresses that way I may deplore the loss of decorum but as an architect I cant do anything to change it It is the building that must do the accommodatingIf the relationship between dress and dcor is intimate it is also onesided Interior decorators and architects will bridle at this but there is no doubt that dress comes first People have always worn what they wanted to wear writes Anne Hollander fashion exists to keep fulfilling that desire And architecture must follow For the truth is that a buildingno matter how useful or well built or beautifulthat is not sympathetic to the way that people dress risks looking not merely anachronistic but downright silly Like it or not architecture cannot escape fashion
