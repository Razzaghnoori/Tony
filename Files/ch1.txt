 the look of architecture one dressing up Architecture is hard to define Goethe called it music frozen in space which while it captures a sense of rhythm is too one dimensional And it relegates the mother of the arts to an inferior position just as well to describe music as melted architecture Nietzsche believed that architecture reflected his pride man s triumph over gravity and his will to power This notion applies to many buildings from Gothic cathedrals to skyscrapers but it is too well Nietzschean The British master Edwin Lutyens referred to architecture as a sort of play In architecture Palladio is the game Le Corbusier described his art as the masterly correct and magnificent play of masses brought together in light which is a good description of one of his own buildings I am partial to Sir Henry Wotton s definition Wotton who lived a long time in Venice and was a lover of architecture though not an architect published a treatise on the subject in 1642 In Architecture as in all other Operative Arts the end must direct the Operation he wrote The end is to build well Well building hath three conditions Commoditie Firmeness and Delight Sir Henry s description which was based on the writings of the Roman architect Vitruvius appeals to me because it emphasizes the complexity of the building art To begin with architecture has not one but three distinct purposes to shelter human activity commodity to durably challenge gravity and the elements firmness and to be an object of beauty delight Architecture is always a synthesis of the three However the fulfillment of one purpose does not guarantee the satisfaction of the others There are homely sturdy buildings and beautiful flimsy ones A well planned building can be ugly just as a beautiful building can function poorly Form does not contrary to Louis Sullivan s hoary maxim follow function Not only are function and form separate over their long lives buildings can successfully accommodate a variety of uses For example some of the most famous museums the Louvre the Hermitage the Belvedere started life as royal palaces the Uffizi in Florence is so named because it originally housed offices and the Prado in Madrid was designed to be a museum of science not art The acclaimed Mus e d Orsay in Paris is housed in a railroad station Two of my favorite small museums the Frick Collection in New York City and the Phillips Collection in Washington D C were built as residences As historic preservation and adaptive reuse demonstrate you can shop in a renovated warehouse do office work in a converted loft or live in a barn Assuming of course that the warehouse the loft and the barn were well built The material fabric of old buildings the heavy beams rough brick walls and solid woodwork is one of their chief pleasures That is why we feel cheated by hollow walls flimsy doors and shaky balustrades Buildings should last and feel as though they will One might assume that just as the highest rated cars Mercedes Benz BMW Lexus represent the highest standards of automobile technology the most admired architecture would be the best built This was generally true in the past but in the twentieth century when new materials and new aesthetic theories often have driven architects to cavalier experimentation even celebrated architects have fallen short in that department Le Corbusier s white suburban villas for example were crudely finished in cement plaster on top of brick and since the architect usually ignored for aesthetic reasons intrusive metal flashing and coping strips the crude machines for living often aged poorly Some Frank Lloyd Wright buildings have leaky skylights sagging overhangs and defective heating systems This does not make them any less delightful to visit but it must make them considerably less delightful to inhabit Perhaps the most dramatic example of failed experimentation in recent years is the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris which opened in 1977 The building was widely praised for its architectural innovation the British periodical Architectural Design called it a seminal building of the Modern Movement The architects Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers turned the building literally inside out They dramatically hung pipes ducts fire stairs elevators and escalators from the exterior structure These previously hidden elements were now exposed in plain sight and exposed to the elements The result might have been foreseen after only twenty years the French government was obliged to close the building for a two year renovation Although the authorities maintained that the renovation was required because of the unexpectedly large number of visitors according to Le Monde almost half of the 90 million budget was spent on refurbishing the fa ade The University of Pennsylvania where I teach is the site of Louis I Kahn s A N Richards Medical Research Laboratory This structural tour de force of precast concrete and brick brought its designer international acclaim I remember traveling from Montreal to Philadelphia as a student to see the building a few years after it was built My classmates and I particularly admired the exposed concrete structure and the explicit separation of what Kahn called servant and served spaces massive brick ventilation shafts and delicate glass enclosed individual laboratories However The latter proved to be unpopular with their occupants The large windows let in too much light today most are papered over with aluminum foil cement dust from the exposed concrete beams falls on the lab tables and the rigid plan has proved inflexible to changing needs The Richards Laboratory was built only 35 years ago It is next to a student dormitory known as the Quad a picturesque Jacobean Revival complex planned around a series of courtyards This handsome building has been doing yeoman service for almost a century The Quad was designed by the Philadelphia firm of Walter Cope and John Stewardson whose work at the University of Pennsylvania Princeton and Bryn Mawr was largely responsible for the popularity of so called Collegiate Gothic Pleasing well loved and well built the Quad is architecture of the highest order Yet my classmates and I did not pay any attention to the dormitory when we visited Philadelphia years ago We had never heard of Cope Stewardson despite their achievements and wide cultural influence The architecture historians whom we studied Siegfried Giedion Nikolaus Pevsner James Marston Fitch favored innovators and experimenters even if the innovations and experiments often failed Put another way most historians of modern architecture gave precedence to Delight over Commoditie and Firmeness This may be because the appearance of a building was easier to assess especially at a distance than either its functional performance or material durability Or maybe they were attracted chiefly to the aesthetic qualities of architecture In any case imaginative inventive and revolutionary were more likely accolades to be showered on important buildings than accommodating dependable and sound This is not to say that good architecture is merely utilitarian One of the grandest spaces in Philadelphia is the concourse of Thirtieth Street Station which was built in 1934 for the Pennsylvania Railroad by the accomplished Chicago architects Graham Anderson Probst White the successor firm of Daniel H Burnham The magnificent room 290 feet long and almost 100 feet high is covered by a flat coffered ceiling decorated in red gold and cream Diffused light streams in from tall windows on both sides Almost nothing in this memorable space the gilded Art Deco chandeliers the travertine walls the massive Corinthian columns at each end was a product of its rather mundane function to provide a waiting space for people before they descended the staircases that led to the platforms below But the railroad station concourse in the heyday of railroad travel was more than merely a place to get on and off trains It was a gateway to the city as well as a symbol of unreserved faith in modern transportation and in the Pennsylvania Railroad That is why it was appropriate for delight to take precedence over commodity Yet delight is not uniform The Main Concourse of Grand Central Terminal in New York City for example offers different pleasures than Thirtieth Street Station The monumental spaces are comparable in size and function They are both well built Similar spaces similar materials yet the experience of the two concourses is different Both buildings are inspired by the Classical architecture of the past but Grand Central which opened in 1913 is a modified version of Beaux Arts Classicism whereas the Philadelphia station despite the Corinthian columns is simplified abstracted and stylized what historians called stripped Classicism As a result Grand Central is dramatic visually rich in its details almost Wagnerian Thirtieth Street is equally dramatic but in a way that is coolly geometrical and sleekly urbane not Wagner Cole Porter Style is evident in the smallest details It ensures a continuity between the great vaulted sky of Grand Central and the ticket counters or between the Thirtieth Street chandeliers and the announcement boards at each track stair It is the visual language of a building Architectural style is the manner in which the architect communicates a particular kind of visual delight in large ways and small Commodity firmness and delight are never evenly weighted Sometimes one predominates sometimes the other Sometimes a waiting room needs to be a triumphal celebration of arrival and departure sometimes it is just a waiting room Sometimes it is necessary to compromise structural simplicity to achieve an esthetic effect Sometimes functional requirements override other considerations a laboratory that does not serve its scientists is a failed work of architecture no matter how beautiful its design A banal church is a greater failure than a banal factory The art of building requires judiciously balancing Wotton s three conditions The end must direct the operation That is what distinguishes architecture from the fine arts of painting and sculpture An artist can paint square wheels Paul Klee once observed but an architect must make them round Architecture in this respect is no different than other operative arts such as cooking The creativity of the chef is likewise circumscribed by factors outside his control the natural ingredients the human palate the chemistry of foods The dish must be at once nourishing commodity cookable firmness and of course tasty delight It should also look good although the contemporary trend toward visually extravagant dishes seems to me an aberration The art of cooking like the art of architecture lies in knowing how to establish the appropriate relations between the three conditions The experience of food is sensual It is also first hand That is while it s fun to read recipes and look at photographs of table settings in Gourmet magazine no one I know considers this a substitute for eating The experience of buildings is sensual too Yet many of us get our first glimpses of buildings particularly celebrated buildings as images in books magazines newspapers public lectures and exhibitions One of the most famous buildings of the Modern movement Ludwig Mies van der Rohe s Barcelona Pavilion was known almost entirely through photographs since it was built for an exhibition that lasted only seven months Before photography the Paimio Tubercolosis Sanatorium located in a remote part of Finland would have remained obscure as it was its stunning images brought the young Alvar Aalto worldwide recognition The Sydney Opera House is another world famous building that at least outside Australia relatively few people have seen first hand Yet photography tells us very little about how a building fulfills its function or about how it is built For example the handrails in the often photographed stairway of the Paimio sanatorium look like standard International Style metal pipes In fact they are wood much more pleasant to the touch painted to look like metal Well known photographs of the Barcelona Pavilion show eight free standing columns supporting a flat slab and free standing marble screens that carry no loads a prototypical International Style structure In reality there are columns concealed within the screens which are not slabs of marble but thin marble sheets attached to a masonry back up wall In other words this 1929 building is an example of traditional layered construction not of modernistic structural purism 1 In photographs buildings are forever young The ravages of time weather and use are banished It is a shock to come across a revered architectural icon and to find the concrete stained the painted window frames chipped the tiles cracked Of course all buildings age but some age more gracefully than others A 450 year old Palladio villa retains its beauty despite peeling plaster and mossy stonework perhaps it even looks more enchanting Most modern buildings on the other hand lose their potency if they are not gleaming and machinelike Obviously photography highlights the visual qualities of buildings and ignores commodity and firmness Yet photography cannot completely communicate delight A visitor to the Seagram Building in New York for example is surprised to discover the subtle relationship between Mies bronze tower and the Italian Renaissance fa ade of McKim Mead White s Racquet and Tennis Club on the other side of Park Avenue Equally deceptive are photographs of Frank Lloyd Wright s work in Oak Park since they give no hint of the comfortable suburban surroundings of his so called prairie houses As I student I studied the buildings of Le Corbusier in black and white photographs which did not prepare me for the shock of experiencing his often wildly polychrome interiors Nor can photography communicate movement which is such an integral part of the architectural experience film is better at this but not much Nothing conveys the actual experience of a building like the real thing To paraphrase Robert Hughes a photograph of architecture is to architecture as telephone sex is to sex Never is modern architectural photography more misleading than in its portrayal of domestic interiors Interiors are usually photographed empty or with minimal furnishings before the owners have had the opportunity to move in and presumably defile the purity of the design But even if the space is occupied strict conventions prevail furniture must be lined up just so there must be no distractions no half empty tea cups no crumpled newspapers no abandoned children s toys Books on shelves are arranged to create interesting patterns personal mementos are temporarily banished everything must be neat I once observed a photographer s assistant during a photo shoot comb out the fringe of a rug Such primping and visual editing sets off the architecture to best advantage It also not coincidentally gives the impression that the designed interior is autonomous and self contained in other words that it is a work of art Markedly these photographs never include human figures People would be the greatest distraction of all The world of buildings depicted in books and magazines is a scaleless self sufficient place The absence of people in architectural photographs has several effects In the past the proportions and dimensions of buildings were based on the human body While this was done for philosophical reasons it also ensured a direct relationship between architecture and people it is why even very large Classical buildings feel comfortable By removing people from buildings architectural photography makes it possible to regard architecture as an abstraction unrelated to humans It is not merely that the conventions of modern architectural photography ideally communicate the intentions of most modern architects it is also that they validate those intentions People Who needs them While I was writing Home I discovered that the most useful historical sources for information about how people furnished and decorated their homes were often paintings Not paintings in which the room was the subject but portraits and domestic genre scenes An example of the latter is James Tissot s Hide and Seek which shows four little girls at play in a Victorian sitting room The d cor is exotic an eclectic mixture of Persian rugs Chinese porcelain pots and tiger skins and others furs scattered over the furniture Tissot was a French painter who settled in London in 1871 An easel in the corner suggests that this is his own house in which case the woman sunk deep into an easy chair reading a newspaper may be his Irish mistress John Singer Sargent s masterpiece The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit painted in 1882 likewise shows four girls Henry James described it as the happy play world of a family of charming children but the girls can hardly be said to be playing Properly dressed in white pinafores black socks and patent leather shoes they form a motionless tableau The room in an apartment in Paris is stylishly bare unadorned except for two immense Japanese vases and a red screen The mood is entirely different in the Swedish painter Carl Larsson s playful Mother s and the Cherubs Room which was included in Larsson s famous book Ett Hem At Home published in 1899 The walls of his wife s bedroom are wooden boards whitewashed and decorated with a painted frieze of ribboned garlands the ceiling likewise wood is painted green with red trim The simple furniture is also painted in bright colors Karin Larsson s bed is separated from the children s cots by a striped woven curtain We see three of the Larsson girls in various stages of dress and undress That is appropriate too for naturalism and artlessness permeate this charming scene Such paintings are more faithful depictions of domestic surroundings than modern architectural photographs For one thing they are full of the signs of everyday life A coat is thrown casually over a chair there are crumbs on the table Tissot s little girl playing on the floor rumples the carpet Moreover in these interiors the architecture is in the background It is a setting for human activity just as it is in real life Paintings also convey something about the atmosphere of the interior Dutch seventeenth century domestic paintings for example exude a prosperous air of bourgeois comfort and propriety A hundred years later Fran ois Boucher painted a middle class French family gathering for morning coffee in a little room with japanned woodwork and gilded moldings There is a sweet intimacy here that is absent in the Dutch interiors An interior of the same period by Henry Walton shows an English gentleman at breakfast He is sitting in a relaxed posture wearing a riding coat and boots accompanied by his dog The ambience is one of informal and relaxed country life As I studied such paintings I started to see associations between the rooms and their inhabitants The legs of the mahogany furniture in an English country house were as straight and unadorned as their owners riding boots The arabesques and curlicues of the moldings and architectural ornaments in a French salon mirrored the flouncing ribbons that adorned the women s dresses and the frills of the men s shirts The proper black broadcloth and white lace collars of the Dutch men and women echoed the spotless black and white checkerboard marble floors I became convinced that a strong connection exists between the way that we decorate our homes and the way that we dress ourselves There are three distinct reasons for the intimate relationship between dress and d cor The first is technical D cor like dress incorporates fabrics Curtains swags and window treatments are made of silk damask satin brocade wool muslin and velvet so is clothing Woven materials are used in tapestries wall hangings carpets and upholstery as well as coats and skirts Inevitably the dressmaker s techniques of embroidering gathering pleating and trimming find their way into d cor This is why furniture skirts recall women s skirts and why the fringes cords and bobbins of nineteenth century drapery recall ladies ballgowns The delicate lace curtains and the billowing baldachin over a bed in a ladies boudoir matched the clothes in her dressing room The connection between d cor and dress can be even more intimate for architecture sometimes directly mimics dress The garlands in eighteenth century buildings are sculpted or painted versions of the sashes and flowered ornaments worn by men and women The ancient Greeks incorporated elements of dress in temple architecture This is most apparent in colonnades which Vincent Scully has likened to hoplites massed in a phalanx 2 There is no doubt that Classical columns were given human attributes Ancient authors likened the vertical flutes to the folds in a chiton or tunic 3 Columns have capitals that is heads The moldings of Doric capitals were sometimes painted to resemble headbands Ionic and Corinthian capitals incorporated carved head garlands and the curving tendrils of Corinthian capitals often look more like hair than foliage Indeed Vitruvius considered the Corinthian order feminine as opposed to the sturdy masculine Doric Sir Henry Wotton went so far as to call the Corinthian order lascivious and decked like a wanton courtesan 4 The second connection between dress and d cor is social In the 1890s the famous English economist Alfred Marshall observed that as people earned more money they wanted better food better clothes and larger homes both for social standing and comfort Since homes and clothes are timeworn ways in which to convey status there is a conformity in the types of materials and symbols used to convey social standing If family coats of arms are displayed they will be seen on wall medallions as well as on blazer buttons If gold is treasured the wealthy will wear gold braid and surround themselves with gilt moldings If this is considered too flashy other materials can convey status stainless steel kitchen appliances and stainless steel watch bracelets Diamonds may be forever but fashions change Today leather is considered a luxury material and is used both for expensive clothing and expensive sofas A hundred years ago leather was considered utilitarian leather aprons and vests were worn only by workmen and leather easy chairs were only found in smoking rooms and men s clubs since leather was less flammable than fabric But it was never used in salons or drawing rooms When corduroy originally used only in workingmen s dress became accepted by the middle class it also showed up as upholstery The current fashion for natural dress fabrics cotton wool linen has a counterpart in natural d cor exposed brick oiled wood polished concrete In a more general sense and this has nothing to do with conspicuous consumption both homes and clothes convey values Carl Larsson s home was a statement of both his and Karin s naturalistic aesthetic ideals so was James Tissot s exotic sitting room Whether or not we are artists our homes like our clothes communicate who we are or at least how we wish others to perceive us starchly formal or comfortably casual intensely avant garde or resolutely traditional bohemian or conservative cosmopolitan or down home The Che Guevara poster on the wall and the embroidered denim jacket convey one set of values Colonial break fronts and penny loafers another That is why it is disconcerting if dress and d cor are not in harmony Sweat shirts and running shoes in a Louis Quinze drawing room send a decidedly mixed message as does a three piece suit on the deck of a Malibu beach bungalow The third connection between dress and d cor concerns perception Architecture interior decoration and fashion design are three distinct fields yet we experience them with the same eye Whether we look at dress or d cor we bring the same visual bias the same sensibility the same taste This sensibility is not constant Sometimes we appreciate simplicity sometimes complexity Fashionable seventeenth century French eyes for example favored floral decorations and embroidery and introduced the custom of having vases of fresh flowers in the home English eyes in the midst of the Neoclassic revival sought fundamental simplicity and sobriety in men s clothes as well as in architecture Victorian eyes fancied dense patterns that were likely to show up in waistcoats and on wainscotting Parisian eyes in the early 1900s admired the same neo Empire motifs in dress and d cor Early twentieth century eyes had their own particular sensibility One of the great interiors of this period is the main living space of the Tugendhat House designed by Mies Van der Rohe in 1928 The house stands outside Brno Czechoslovakia The exterior is a low key International Style white box but the interior is astonishing The public rooms are contained in one large open space A curved wall of macassar ebony defines the dining room and a straight free standing wall of onyx dor e separates the music room from the living room The space is punctuated by slender cruciform columns covered in chromed metal The east and south walls are floor to ceiling glass a precursor of Mies famous glass house The sense of openness is heightened when at the touch of a button fifteen foot sections of the glass wall sink into the ground I have never seen the Tugendhat House except in a handful of black and white photographs the house was severely damaged during the Second World War This is another case where photographs are a poor substitute They do not convey the rich textures of the raw silk and velvet draperies nor the vivid colors of the upholstery emerald green leather and ruby red velvet Nor do they capture the sumptuous range of materials onyx pearwood handwoven wool chromed metal and surprisingly a linoleum floor Since the surviving photographs do not show any human figures they heighten the impression that the house was built yesterday especially as the furniture designed by the architect is still in production Mies van der Rohe appears in a photograph taken in 1926 The place is Stuttgart the site of the famous Weissenhof housing exhibition which he planned and where he brought together the leading exponents of the soon to be christened International Style One of these was Le Corbusier who is also in the photograph The two firebrands who will soon set the architectural world on its ear are deep in conversation Le Corbusier smokes a pipe and sports a jaunty derby and a loose short tweed coat Mies looking older than his forty years wears a Homburg a long dark ulster and spats This photograph puts the Tugendhat House in context However modern the airy room appears to my eyes it contained a considered and formal way of life that is as remote from me as waxed moustaches Homburgs and spats It is in that context that Mies curious combination of ordered simplicity and sybaritic luxury must be understood Nothing could be less similar to the Tugendhat House than Charles Moore s weekend house that he built for himself in the hills above Berkeley California I saw it in the summer of 1964 two years after it was built While the Tugendhat House appears sexy and glamorous the Moore house is at first glance downright rustic a little barn twenty six feet square capped by a saddle roof It is an elegant little barn however with white painted walls and large windows that open up the corners not by disappearing into the ground but by sliding sideways like barn doors The one room interior contains a grand piano and a sunken bath that looks vaguely Roman perhaps because the skylight above it is supported by four solid fir Tuscan columns found by Moore at a demolition site Four similar columns support a second skylight over a sitting area I admire the Tugendhat House but I could not imagine living in it That is I could not imagine having to dress up sufficiently to feel at home The Moore house on the other hand reflects a more compliant sensibility Its floor to ceiling windows spare detailing and open interior mark it as a successor to the International Style Yet the shingled roof and the Tuscan columns hearken back to older traditions The little building manages to be comfortable relaxed archetypal and vaguely ironic all at the same time The eclectic Californian setting is both informal and formal Put another way it is a place where people who wear tweed jackets with jeans or silk skirts with canvas espadrilles would fit right in The little Moore barn is an historic building Together with Robert Venturi s Vanna Venturi House which was designed the same year it marks the advent of an architectural style that became known as Postmodernism 5 One of the celebrated buildings of Postmodernism is James Stirling s Neue Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart which was completed in 1984 Stirling vastly expands Moore s eclecticism combining a bewildering mixture of forms a Doric portico a staid neoclassical wing that matches the existing museum an Egyptian looking curved cornice a colorful Russian Constructivist entrance canopy a curving steel and glass wall and two huge blue ventilator funnels lifted straight from the Centre Georges Pompidou The monumental fa ade of alternating bands of travertine and sandstone is undermined by oversized fiberglass handrails that look like pink sausages I couldn t understand this design except as a tour de force until I visited the building It was a wintry Sunday and the Staatsgalerie was packed it is one of the most popular museums in Germany Now the architecture made sense This museum cum discotheque was the perfect setting for the eclectic crowd We were wearing every type of dress imaginable casual wear business suits ski parkas work clothes Some people dressed up for a Sunday visit to the museum some dressed down Stirling s lively collage absorbed us all I did not see any gentlemen in Homburgs and spats but they would have fitted in too A number of years ago I accompanied the architect Jack Diamond on a visit to a building that he had just completed at York University in Toronto It was a student center containing a food court and lounges on the main level and student organization offices on the second floor The exterior of the building was decidedly traditional Facing a landscaped common the well proportioned fa ade consisted of a colonnaded brick base supporting a row of double columns capped by a deep copper lined cornice Behind the colonnade which was fitted with retractable glass panels that could be opened during warm weather was a two story high hall lit by three large skylights The exterior had a simplicity that reminded me of McKim Mead White albeit without Classical ornament The interior was different with many hallmarks of the International Style no decoration bare concrete exposed structural beams factory sash glazing and steel pipe railings I assumed that the stark simplicity was the result of a restricted budget and a desire to use materials that would withstand wear and tear It seemed pretty banal to me and although I didn t say anything to Jack I was disappointed Yet as we walked around I changed my mind Although the d cor was tough and unsentimental it was not crude There were sleek stainless steel pendant lighting fixtures with suspended glass diffusers and stylish easy chairs covered in canvas In the food court the bar and counter tops were marble the dining tables solid maple Students were gathered around tables lounging on the staircase sprawled on the floor The atmosphere was hard to pin down This was not the precious corporate modernism of Richard Meier nor the contrived technological wizardry of Norman Foster It was certainly not the Calvinist minimalism that I associated with many trendy younger architects I couldn t put my finger on it until I realized that the functional but chic d cor reminded me of the no nonsense styling of a Benetton clothing store I happen to like Collegiate Gothic buildings I like their dark rooms with wood paneling hammer beam ceilings and traditional oak furniture But seeing the York student center made me realize that whenever I walk through these old buildings I also experience a nagging dissatisfaction It has to do with the students The young men and women in baseball caps shorts stenciled sweat shirts and iridescent nylon windbreakers just don t fit in They should be wearing boaters and blazers tweeds and flannels Of course no student that I have ever seen including at Oxford dresses that way I may deplore the loss of decorum but as an architect I can t do anything to change it It is the building that must do the accommodating If the relationship between dress and d cor is intimate it is also one sided Interior decorators and architects will bridle at this but there is no doubt that dress comes first People have always worn what they wanted to wear writes Anne Hollander fashion exists to keep fulfilling that desire 6 And architecture must follow For the truth is that a building no matter how useful or well built or beautiful that is not sympathetic to the way that people dress risks looking not merely anachronistic but downright silly Like it or not architecture cannot escape fashion
