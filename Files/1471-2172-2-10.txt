 Introduction Elderly people show an increased incidence of infectious neoplastic and inflammatory diseases that may be linked to declining functional competence of the peripheral T cells 1 2 3 4 5 At the cellular level this decline in immune response is reflected in aged T cell in vitro proliferation decreased production of interleukin 2 2 6 7 8 and 11 2 receptor 7 9 10 and defective progression thought the cell cycle 11 12 HIV infection likewise induces a progressive suppression in proliferation of both CD4 and CD8 T cells in vitro that correlates with clinical severity as well as diminished 11 2 production 13 14 15 16 However even stronger parallels exist between immune phenomena in aging and AIDS than suppression of T cell proliferation and 11 2 production There is a relative increase in the memory cell repertoire 17 18 19 20 and an increase in absolute counts in the CD8 CD28 populations in both aged 22 and HIV donors 22 23 24 25 The CD8 CD28 T cell in the HIV state appears to be the major cytotoxic T cell CTL 26 but curiously has shortened telemer lengths as well 27 Previous studies indicate considerable inconsistency regarding production of the immune regulatory cytokine interferon IFN and the preinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor TNF from T cells of HFV and aged individuals The disparity in IFN expression is reflected in reports of decreased 28 29 30 31 normal 21 32 or increased 33 34 35 36 37 synthesis in both aged and HIV T cells Similarly with TNF there are contradictory reports of decreased 37 38 normal 29 or increased 12 31 39 40 production in the HIV and aged T cells Explanations for the divergent findings can be attributed to many factors including cell preparation choice of activators and quantitative methodology Recently we showed 25 that IFN production in HIV derived CD8 T cells was strongly stimulated by upon activation anti CD3 and PMA Using this mode of activation we selected flow cytometry for analysis of HIV and aged T cells in this study since this method obviates the inherent complications association with experimental variability of T cell purification and activation Subsequently the flow cytometric data based on the percentage of active cells was supported by cytokine mRNA and ELISA data We find by all three methods that IFN and TNF production is enhanced several fold in CD8 T cells from aged and HIV individuals and it is the CD8 CD28 subset as shown by flow cytometry which is primarily responsible These findings assume clinical importance since they may explain in part the chronic and autoimmune pathologies in the elderly particularly rheumatoid arthritis Crohn s disease sepsis and myelodysplastic syndromes which are exacerbated by the inflammatory cytokines IFN and TNF 41 Likewise the elevation of these cytokines particularly TNF potentially may contribute to the deterioration in the HIV or AIDS patient by promoting wasting and cachexia 42 Results Enhanced IFN and TNF production in aged and HIV CD8 T cells Representative examples of the cytometric profile of aged and HIV human T cells CD4 and CD8 and controls normal young donors are shown in Fig 1 the cells producing IFN and TNF appear in the upper quadrants The percentages of either CD4 or CD8 T cells producing cytokine upper quadrant are shown In these studies the peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC were prepared and activated for 15 hrs with anti CD3 plus PMA and processed with the appropriate fluorescent labeled antibodies For 3 color FC analysis the samples were first gated for the CD3 positive cells thus eliminating B cells NK cells and macrophages and then examined for CD8 and cytokine containing cells Based on past studies the non CD8 T cells are primarily composed of CD4 T cells and are designated as such Controls not shown for every sample were also examined for cytokine producing cells upper quadrants in which no activators were added 0 0 0 6 positive cells were observed Previously we found 25 that activation by anti CD3 and PMA was far superior to other activation modes such as Con A plus PMA in stimulating IFN synthesis Anti CD3 or PMA alone did not induce cytokine production 25 In all instances with anti CD28 as coactivator the IFN and TNF responses were low rarely exceeding 15 of that produced by PMA anti CD3 activation The production of IFN and TNF from aged and HIV T cells CD4 and CD8 activated by anti CD3 and PMA is shown in Table I The data were derived from the flow cytometric analysis of the CD8 and CD4 T cell profiles of forty aged thirty two HIV and forty eight normal young donors Experiments with the HrV derived cells were performed separately from those with aged cells with 24 control donors used in each case The cytokine analysis relies on the intracellular accumulation of cytokines in the Golgi compartment over the 15 hr activation period induced by either brefeldin A or monensin Both inhibitors block Golgi function and thus cytokine secretion the former by inhibition of protein vesicle transport 43 the latter by inhibition of Na gradients 44 Flow cytometric analysis of cells from the aged donors activated by anti CD3 and PMA shows that IFN production is enhanced significantly approximately 3 fold in the CD8 T cell compartment in terms of percent of producing cells compared to young control donors Table I Even with Con A and PMA activation the aged CD8 T cell response was 4 fold enhanced over young controls 28 0 and 7 0 respectively data not shown The response of brefeldin treated CD8 cells was somewhat greater than in the monensin treated cells for both aged and controls For the HiV group the number of IFN producing CD8 T cells was similarly enhanced over normal controls with both types of Golgi inhibitors Interestingly although the CD4 T cell is a target for the HIV the IFN response is not significantly changed from the normal CD4 T cell response Likewise with the aged CD4 cells there is no significant difference with the responses of the cells from young donors The changes in TNF production in CD8 T cells from HIV and aged individuals are comparable to that for IFN production Fig 1and Table I Aged CD8 T cells show a significant increase approximately 3 fold over young cells in the percentage producing TNF 57 6 versus 19 0 In the HIV cases also the CD8 T cells show significantly enhanced TNF production 2 fold However in contrast to the IFN data the aged CD4 T cells are modestly but significantly increased over the young CD4 T cells 50 3 versus 35 9 The CD4 T cells from HIV donors also are slightly more capable of TNF production than the normal CD4 T cells 51 0 versus 42 0 a difference that is significant Thus in the aging and HIV scenario it is apparent that the CD8 T cells show an enhanced capacity for both TNF production and IFN production The CD4 T cells show a small but significant capacity for TNF production in both scenarios Comparative analysis of the CD8 CD28 and CD8 CD28 T cells by flow cytometry For each blood sample a non activated control was prepared in which the PBMC were incubated in the absence of activators anti CD3 and PMA and then examined by flow cytometry Such controls showed no significant cytokine containing cells and these samples were used to calculate the resting CD4 CD8 distribution and the CD28 CD28 distribution As shown in Table III there is a dramatic phenotypic change in the CD8 subsets in the aged and HIV states in relation to young healthy controls In our IFN studies the CD28 population accounts for 61 3 aged to 70 0 HIV of the total CD8 population In healthy controls the CD8 CD28 subset accounts for only 28 31 of the CD8 cells In the TNF studies the CD28 cells are 64 2 aged to 68 3 HIV of the total CD8 population The TNF and IFN studies were carried out separately These results indicate that in the HIV and aged states the CD28 subset becomes dominant assuming approximately two thirds of the total CD8 cells whereas in the normal healthy state the CD28 T cell subset accounts for approximately two thirds Thus in terms of cell numbers the CD28 cells constitute the majority of the CD8 T cells and explains our previous findings 16 45 that the mitogenic signal arising from coactivation by anti CD28 was greatly suppressed in CD8 T cells from HIV donors compared to normal donors The data Table III show that the CD8 CD28 T cells also account for the increased production of TNF and IFN in both the HIV and aged states In these states the percent of CD28 cells producing each cytokine dominates the normal young controls by a 2 1 to 3 1 margin Thus not only are the CD28 cells greater in number but they are proportionately much more active in cytokine production As a consequence the data show that the CD28 population accounts for the majority of the cytokine producing CD8 T cells 79 6 86 7 in the HIV and aged populations Typical examples of the CD8 CD28 profiles are shown in Fig 2 It is evident that the cells from the HIV and aged states have a greater capacity for TNF and IFN production compared to the normal control CD28 or CD28 population Production of other cytokines I1 2 4 6 and 10 The ability of CD4 and CD8 T cells from aged and HIV donors to synthesize 11 2 11 4 11 6 and 11 10 were also studied by flow cytometry Only in the case of 11 2 was an appreciable number of cytokine producing cells observed 25 For normal young cells at least 15 30 of CD4 cells were positive for 11 2 while only 3 6 of the CD8 cells were positive With HIV and aged T cells there was a significant 11 2 response also but it was generally smaller than from the young normal control cells data not shown The percentage of cells positive for production of 11 4 11 6 and 11 10 was extremely low The number of productive cells was often 1 and only rarely exceeded 2 of either the CD4 or CD8 population No significant difference was observed between the control cells and those derived from HIV or aged donors Production of IFN and TNF mRNA determined by Quantitative PCR The mRNA isolated from CD8 T cells from 12 aged 10 HIV and 15 controls were purified and used in these studies The results shown in Fig 3are expressed as IFN or TNF cDNA copies ug total RNA CD8 T cells were incubated for 3 hrs with PMA and anti CD3 prior to total RNA extraction For IFN CD8 T cells from both the HIV and aged states show a 4 5 5 fold enhancement in cDNA copies 32 000 and 47 000 respectively versus controls of 7 400 and 9 100 Likewise the TNF cDNA copies are enhanced approximately 4 fold in the CD8 T cells from aged and HIV states In view of the flow cytometric data we can infer that the enhanced mRNA in the CD8 T cells derives primarily from the CD8 CD28 T cells Secreted IFN and TNF determined by ELISA The PBMC and purified CD8 T cells from eight donors and seven control donors were incubated for 66 hrs and the media examined by ELISA The results shown in Table III demonstrate that production of IFN is upregulated over controls from 3 5 4 fold for the CD8 T cells from HIV and aged donors For TNF the increase was also substantial 2 3 4 fold Discussion Our data show that the HIV and aged conditions foster a change in the CD8 T cell repertoire characterized by expansion of a CD8 CD28 phenotype capable of enhanced IFN and TNF production These results contrast with other studies concluding that the production of these cytokines was downregulated or unchanged in T cells from HIV and aged individuals 21 28 29 30 31 32 37 38 Reliability in our findings derives from use of flow cytometric analysis which measures de novo synthesis per cell and thus obviates numerous artifacts possibly associated with ELISA or procedures that measure mRNA synthesis Secondly similar results were obtained with two different inhibitors of Golgi transport Thirdly of the cytokines examined including 11 4 11 6 and 11 10 only IFN and TNF were enhanced in the HIV or aged states Fourthly CD4 T cells did not show a significant change in IFN production but did show a small but significant increase in TNF production in aged and HIV derived cells Fifthly the mRNA and ELISA studies support the conclusions of the flow cytometric data The question arises whether or not our results have physiological relevance since PMA and anti CD3 was used to elicit the cytokine responses we observed The question resolves into two parts are TNF and IFN levels increased in the HIV and aged states and do the CD8 T cells show increased production of these cytokines There is considerable evidence supporting both parts of this question Regarding part one IFN levels are elevated in the sera of HIV patients 45 Serum levels of both TNF and IFN were markedly higher in HIV patients over controls but varied depending on the skin disease exhibited by the patient 46 AIDS patients also showed elevated TNF levels in the plasma 47 Studies of lymphocytes from aged donors showed increase serum levels of TNF and IFN that correlate with upregulation of HLA DR on CD3 lymphocytes 48 Regarding part two there are many studies showing that physiological activation of CD8 T cells from HIV or aged donors prompts increased IFN and or TNF production HIV lymph nodes exhibit a large 6 fold increase in CD8 T cells most of which are involved in IFN production 49 Amison et al 50 concluded that IFN is secreted by the CD8 T cell in HIV infections In CD8 T cells from African HIV patients stimulated with env peptide both IFN and TNF production were increased over controls 52 PBMC from the elderly almost healthy donors showed upregulation of TNF in unstimulated cultures 52 HLA DR activation of CD8 CD57 cells from elderly subjects strongly produced TNF 48 Lipopolysaccharide activation of T cells from aged donors induced higher levels of TNF than controls in two separate studies 53 31 Finally in HIV patients receiving HIV type 1 antigen both INF and TNF were significantly increased in memory T cells activated by antigen 54 Thus there appears to be considerable support for the enhanced presence of TNF and INF in the HIV and the aged states and for a physiologic role of the CD8 T cell subset in their production Our data shows that it is the CD8 CD28 cell that is primarily responsible Why the CD8 CD28 subset should dominated in such apparently diverse conditions as the HIV and the aged states is not known However the notion that similarities exist between the HIV and the aged states with respect to the CD8 CD28 T cell has been presented previously 55 It has also been proposed that the CD8 CD28 T cell in the HIV state is derived from the CD8 CD28 cells by clonal expansion induced by massive antigenic stimulus HIV proteins since both showed the same epitope repertoire 26 Dolad et al 56 have shown that the CD8 CD28 cell not the CD8 CD28 cell comprises the major CTL activity in the HIV state a finding confirmed by Vingerhoets et al 57 who associated cytotoxic T cell activity with the CD8 CD28 T cell in HIV infected subjects Thus the CD8 CD28 T cell assumes a crucial role in HIV infection Likewise in the aged state we can speculate that chronic viral and bacterial exposure over a lifetime may induce the clonal expansion of the CD8 CD28 T cell There is evidence that the cytotoxic activity of the CD28 cell can lyse and suppress HIV infected cells 58 59 and thus play a protective role in HIV infection Perhaps in the aged cell as well the CD28 memory cell serves a similar protective role against a variety of viruses The production of IFN and TNF can result in strong anti viral consequences as shown with hepatitis B virus 60 but the cytokines have a dual role since they are associated with inflammatory activity IFN in its defensive role against infection is a foremost factor in converting resting macrophages into the active state 61 where they produce reactive oxidants 62 nitric oxide 63 TNF 61 and neopterin Not only can these factors damage DNA and host tissues but can modulate inflammatory reactions 60 and stimulate apoptosis 64 a major mechanism leading to loss of CD4 T cells 65 TNF also has the capacity to perturb the clinical condition in AIDS by strongly upregulating the transcription of the HIV genome 66 In fact it has been proposed 67 that AIDS is in many ways a TNF disease since this cytokine it is a potent activator of NF kB and an inducer of HIV genome transcription and apoptosis in HIV infected T cells Moreover the wasting weight loss and cachexia associated with AIDS has also been related to TNF activity 42 Thus both IFN and TNF have the potential for a double role in the pathogenesis associated with AIDS i e antiviral and inflammatory responses Based on the AIDS scenario it is reasonable to propose that chronic viral and bacterial infections suffered by an individual over a lifetime may lead to similar consequences as those occurring in acute HIV infection i e clonal expansion of the CD8 CD28 subset at the expense of the CD8 CD28 subset The data argue that the CD28 cell may serve as a natural endpoint in the differentiation of CD8 cells as proposed by Effros et al 27 where aging represents a normal endpoint that occurs after many years of immune activity while AIDS represents an accelerated endpoint due to the increase rate in T cell formation during attempted compensation for CD4 loss induced by HIV By virtue of their inflammatory roles TNF and IFN likely contribute to the exacerbation of the inflammatory conditions associated with the aged For example autoimmune diseases are more prevalent in the aged where certain diseases such as arthritis are often associated with chronic debilitation Interestingly both IFN and TNF are prominent in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases in general the former by activation of local auto antigen presentation to appropriate T cells and the latter by mediation of inflammatory tissue damage 68 Apparently TNF plays a central role in the chronic release of highly arthritogenic II 1 69 and thus serves as a major factor in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis RA 69 Recent studies show that treatment with anti TNF gives significant clinical improvement in RA 70 Thus our findings in aged individuals of a prominent CD8 CD28 T cell subset with enhanced ability to produce TNF may assume clinical relevance It is logical to infer that the increased susceptibility of aged individuals to rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune pathologies may be due to increased TNF and IFN production by the CD8 CD28 T cell It should be noted that the action of IFN on macrophages induces TNF production 61 thus amplifying the effects of the latter Although IFN production in the HIV individual by the CD4 T cells T H 1 has been emphasized 13 45 49 there appears to be little doubt that the production of IFN by CD8 CD28 cells may have greater clinical relevance as discussed above on the increased serum levels 45 46 With TNF as well our data suggest it is likely that the increased serum levels in AIDS 46 47 48 may derive in part from increased numbers of CD8 CD28 cells However TNF levels could also originate from monocytes stimulated by the enhanced IFN production In any case the HIV state is replete with antagonistic complexities of antiviral effects of IFN and TNF on one hand and their inflammatory effects on the other Overall our data presents an intriguing parallel between AIDS and the aging state with regard to their cytokine and CD8 T cell profiles and the potential for new insight into aging mechanisms It is noteworthy that our results are compatible with recent aging studies using gene arrays to measure gene expression in the neocortex and cerebellum of aged and young mice Lee et al 71 found that in both brain regions one hallmark of aging was enhanced gene expression of the inflammatory response including proinflammatory peptides and many interferon related proteins Thus the advent of the CD8 CD28 cell in aging with its potential for proinflammatory cytokines could have profound effects not only on autoimmune diseases but on Alzheimer s disease as well since cytokines may contribute to the neuropathology 72 Materials and Methods Materials Con A phorbol myristate acetate PMA N

Ficoll centrifugation of blood diluted 1 1 with PBS 5 For preparation of purified T cells CD4 and CD8 free of macrophages granulocytes B cells and NK cells the PBMC 1 10 7cells were centrifuged and diluted to 200 ul with 0 1 BSA in PBS After addition of 10 ul of fetal calf serum and 10 ul of antibody mix T cell negative isolation kit from Dynal Inc the cells were incubated 10 minutes at 4 washed in PBS and suspended in 900 ul PBS with 100 ul of depletion beads Dynal After 15 minutes at room temperature the beads are magnetically removed leaving highly purified T cells CD4 and CD8 98 purified in general The yield varied from 40 50 based on the starting number of PBMC For the preparation of purified CD4 T cells 2 10 7purified T cells were incubated for 30 minutes on ice with BioMag mouse anti human CD8 IgG1 monoclonal Ab 500 ul in 3 0 ml RPMI plus 9 FCS diluted 1 1 for 30 min on ice with rocking Similarly to obtain purified CD8 T cells the same procedure was followed except BioMag mouse anti human CD4 IgG2a monoclonal Ab 500 ul was used The cell suspension was brought to 10 ml with cold RPMI media and the desired T cell subset was obtained by magnetic removal of the contaminating cells Flow cytometric analysis indicated that the T cell subsets were 93 98 purified The yield of control and aged cells varied from 58 89 generally whereas the yield from HIV blood generally fell between 24 68 Accessory cells were effectively removed during T cell isolation as shown by the failure of mitogen induced proliferation in the absence of coactivators All cell purification steps were completed and assays initiated within 10 hrs after blood donation The purified CD8 T cells were used for the ELISA and quantitative PCR studies Flow cytometric analysis FC Prior to FC analysis PBMC 3 3 10 5 suspended in 600 ul media were incubated at 37 C overnight in 6 CO 2 with anti CD3 1 500 dilution of acetates fluid and PMA 2 5 ng ml as described previously 25 Either monensin 1 uM or brefeldin A 1 ug ml was used in all cases to block Golgi function and allow cytokine accumulation with the cell For analysis of CD4 and CD8 T cells the PBMC activated and non activated controls were treated as described by the PharMingen Flow Cytometry and Cell Analysis Catalog 1998 Immunofluorescent Staining of Intracellular Cytokines for Flow Cytometric Analysis pp415 417 Briefly PBMCs were washed twice with staining buffer PBS plus 0 5 bovine serum albumin and then fixed by suspending in cold 0 5 paraformaldehyde PFA After incubation for 20 min at 4 the cells were centrifuged decanted and resuspended in 4 PFA for 30 min at 4 Cells were then washed with 1 ml of staining buffer and incubated 30 min at 4 with 50 ul permeabilization buffer 0 1 saponin PBS 0 1 azide To the cell pellet 3 ul of phycoerythrin PE conjugated mouse anti human IFN or TNF monoclonal Ab Pharmingen Inc was added and incubated 30 min at 4 The cells were then washed with 1 ml permeabilization buffer spun down and gently resuspended Then 10 ul of fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC mouse anti CD8 Leu 2a Becton Dickinson and 10 ul peridinin chlorophyll PerCP mouse anti CD3 Leu 4 Becton Dickinson were added followed by incubation in the dark for 20 min at room temperature After washing with 1 ml of staining buffer the cells were fixed with 600 ul of 0 5 PFA for approximately 1 day and then analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer Becton Dickinson equipped with a FL4 channel As an alternative to FC analysis of activated PBMC described above we also studied activated CD4 and CD8 T cells purified as described in the previous sections These studies we carried out in order to completely eliminate the possibility however remote that our FC procedure did not discriminate between the CD8 T cells and NK cells which have low density CD8 receptors However our FC procedure used a sufficiently high anchor gate to examine only the high density CD8 receptors which are uniquely characteristic of the CD8 T cell This is accomplished by using an anchor gate which is sufficiently high As expected our analysis of CD8 T cells using either the purified cells or the PBMC were in complete agreement in 5 experiments in which they were compared i e both showed the same increased production of IFN and TNF from HIV derived or aged CD8 T cells Analysis of CD4 and CD8 T cells Four color cytometric analysis was performed with a Power Macintosh 7600 computer with Cellquest software Statistical analysis was performed on data collected from 10 000 events data points per cell sample To distinguish t cell subsets a gate was drawn around lymphocytes by forward scatter and side scatter region 1 R1 T cells were identified as a CD3 FL3 positive population R2 thereby excluding CD3 populations such as B cells macrophages and NK cells In order to analyze T cell subsets CD4 and CD8 cells for each cytokine production contour plots on CD8 FL1 cytokine FL2 of logical gate 1 events R1 R2 were obtained The event numbers and percentages of each quadrant event were recorded For simplicity the CD3 CD8 T cell subset are assumed to be CD4 and labeled as such in Fig 1 In our experience the CD3 CD4 comprise 95 or more of the CD3 CD8 T cell subset in normal blood In HIV blood a few CD4 T cells may be masked by soluble gp 120 but this would not affect the CD3 CD8 population Analysis of CD28 and CD28 T cells using four color cytometry For this study PBMC were treated as described above except that anti human CD3 FL4 coupled to allophycocyanin APC was used along with anti IFN FITC FL1 anti CD28 PE FL2 and anti CDS PerCP FL3 Region 1 R1 was drawn to identify lymphocytes by forward scatter and side scatter and R2 was drawn to identify T cells FL4 positive Logical gate 1 R1 R2 was used to identify CD4 FL3 negative and CD8 FL3 positive subsets that were designated as R3 and R4 respectively Logical gate 2 R1 R2 R3 events were analyzed for cytokine production by CD28 FL2 or CD28 subpopulations by plotting two dimensional contour plots Logical gate 3 R1 R2 R4 events were similarly analyzed Competitive PCR The competitive PCR was performed using both IFN mRNA and TNF mRNA detection kits from BioSource Corp The mRNA was highly purified from purified CD8 cells activated for 3 hrs with the Ambion RNAqueous kit for total RNA and the Micro Poly A pure kit for mRNA Generally the mRNA obtained was near 2 of total RNA The cDNA was obtained by use of reverse transcriptase Invitrogen PCR was performed in 100 ul final volume containing 1 3 ul of IFN primer 2 18 ul 10X reaction buffer 3 25 ul 200 uM NTP s 4 44 5 ul H 2 O 5 5 ul cDNA 6 5 ul Internal Calibration Standard ICS DNA and 0 5 ul Taq polymerase Components were gently mixed and centrifuged then heated 2 min at 95 Thirty cycles were performed with a Perkin Elmer 9600 thermocycler as follows 1 min at 95 1 min at 55 1 min at 72 The reaction was next heated at 72 for 10 min following by cooling at 4 A 15 ul sample from each PCR reaction was analyzed on 2 agarose gels containing 0 5 ug ml ethidium bromide along with molecular weight standards to determine the fragment size Bands were visualized under UV light and photographed using Polaroid film After cDNA amplification 25 ul of PCR mix was removed and transferred to a microcenterfuge tube The same volume of denaturation solution alkaline pH was added to the tube and incubated for 10 min at room temperature The material was neutralized by the addition of 450 ul of hybridization solution prior to addition to the ICS or IFN oligonucleotide capture wells OCW In order to acquire quantitative results the denatured amplicons were analyzed at 1 20 1 100 1 200 dilution in hybridization buffer Following hybridization unbound material was removed by washing the wells four times with 200 ul diluted wash buffer 100 ul of streptavidin HPR was then added to each well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature The wells were washed again and 100 ul of stabilized chromogen substrate was added After a 30 minute incubation in the dark the reaction was stopped by addition of 100 ul stop solution and the observance was measured at 450 nm The optical density OD in each well is proportional to the amount of amplicon present which can be related to the copy number of either ICS or IFN in the original PCR reaction The total OD is calculated as sample OD multiplied by the amplicon dilution The number of copies of IFN in each PCR reaction are calculated from the ratio of total OD for the IFN specific well to the total OD for the ICS well times the and input copies of the ICS ELISA The IFN and TNF secreted by CD8 T cells into culture media was quantitated using an Elisa kit from either BioSource Corp or Research Diagnostics The CD8 T cells were incubated at 37 for 66 hours in precisely the same way as for mitogenic assay except volumes were doubled and 50 000 cells were used Samples were run in duplicate the results were highly reproducible S D 15 for any given assay and sensitive However sensitivity was not important since with most samples it was necessary to dilute the culture fluid by 1 20 or more The procedure was followed as recommended by the manufacturer The standard curves for IFN and TNF which intersected the origin was generally linear up to 500 pg ml for recombinant IFN and 400 pg ml for TNF
