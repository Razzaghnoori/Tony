 The Yo Yo Peace Plan With peace talks on a yo yo the previously Kosovo obsessed editorial pages largely ignore the subject In Britain the Times and the Independent venture forth with scolding opinions on the peace plan The Times President Clinton s admission that Russian troops in Kosovo may not now come under Nato control is irresponsible only the probably tardy deployment of Russian forces can stop it being disastrous The liberal Independent N or should we crack open the champagne if or when Slobodan Milosevic finally signs on the dotted line The aftermath of such an agreement may prove to be almost as nightmarish as what came before It concluded The military victory will however pale into insignificance by comparison with the task of recreating a civil society in Serbia Above all Serbia needs to win its own battles against intolerance That will be a much more difficult war to fight The world s papers showed no reluctance to pontificate on Monday s Indonesian elections The slowness of the vote count reported Hong Kong s South China Morning Post resulted in the tabulation of less than 2 percent of the more than 116 million votes by Tuesday night and the Straits Times of Singapore reported that s ome tempers flared over the pace of the vote count The government had promised a 50 percent count by that time An election official told the SCMP that the final result wouldn t be announced until June 21 There were also reports of vote buying by the incumbent Golkar Party of former dictator Suharto and of logistical problems such as defective ballots and indelible ink designed to prevent multiple voting which in practice washed off voters thumbs in minutes An editorial in the Jakarta Post declared the elections a triumph for the Indonesian people and democracy but in light of predictions that Golkar would poll strongly in the country s outer islands and might be able to hold on to power with the help of small Islamic parties the Post said It would be a hollow victory and a terrible irony if our exercise in democracy failed to produce the very goal of the whole process Voting out the status quo and putting a proreform government in its place Although Indonesia is 85 percent Muslim the state ideology of Pancasila declares it to be a secular nation As a piece in Wednesday s International Herald Tribune noted politicians business interests and foreign governments are watching to see whether Islamic political parties gain ground in the polling Twelve of the 48 parties contesting the election are Muslim based and some want to make Islam the country s established religion In the final weeks of the campaign two religious groups called on the faithful to support Muslim affiliated parties which was seen by many observers as an attempt to undermine front runner Megawati Sukarnoputri the leader of the Indonesian Democratic Party Struggle and daughter of Sukarno Indonesia s founding president The story reported that there was a clash last week in Sulawesi between Muslim students who questioned whether Indonesian Muslims would accept a female president and supporters of Megawati The Straits Times editorialized that Indonesians are free to vote for any party they want but that choice should be based on what unites them as Indonesians with non Muslims not what separates them Although it now appears that in last week s South African election the African National Congress failed by one seat to reach the two thirds majority that would have given it the power to change the constitution editorials supported President elect Thabo Mbeki Wednesday the Pioneer of India welcomed Mbeki s Africanist agenda Immediately after the dismantling of Apartheid Nelson Mandela s main message was one of reconciliation among races Five years later Mbeki s must be to Africanize It must be Mbeki s concern and responsibility to take a firmer stance on Black empowerment in every shape or form Giving a positive spin to Mbeki s perceived grayness compared with his predecessor the Pioneer said Mandela will be missed of course On the other hand perhaps South Africa may even be able to get a clearer view of its harsh realities and its uphill tasks without his overarching charisma As we in India know only too well in this process charisma sometimes can play saboteur One leader not faring so well this week was Britain s Queen Elizabeth who celebrates her official birthday Saturday The Sydney Morning Herald attacked the dour new image of the monarch on Australia s new coins even mentioning her double chin The Herald complained that the money carries the visage of an old woman hardly surprising since the queen is 73 Meanwhile in New Zealand the Press of Christchurch was underwhelming in its support of the sovereign Under the headline Why we still need the Royals a columnist wrote It s not so much that we ve gone off the Royal family we have merely outgrown them Britain is such an integral part of
