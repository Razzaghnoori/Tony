 Background Several active research programs are investigating the risk associated with serum estrogens gonadotropins and urinary sex hormone metabolites for a variety of diseases including breast cancer 1 endometrial cancer 2 and osteoporosis 3 The results of the few published studies suggest that the natural temporal variability true variation over time not variation due to storage or other factors of some serum estrogens gonadotropins and urinary sex hormone metabolites is sufficiently great that a single measurement occasion may be inadequate to ensure a reliable estimate 4 5 6 Published intraclass correlation coefficients ICC vary between 0 06 and 0 62 for estradiol E 2 and between 0 52 and 0 69 for estrone E 1 4 Only the percent of free E 2 and of SHBG bound E 2 have been found to be sufficiently reliable to account for as much as 50 of the variance in the true mean ICC 0 7 The term reliability can refer either to the consistency of a measuring procedure or to the temporal stability of the target of measurement 7 The definition of temporal reliability used in this study includes both those dimensions but emphasizes the latter While researchers can control error due to insufficient repeated measures by increasing the number of measurement occasions obtaining measurements is expensive It is therefore useful to have evidence based guidelines for estimating the minimum number of occasions required to obtain a given degree of reliability for a particular analyte All types of measurement error distort confound or attenuate the tests of association that constitute one of the primary products of research 8 9 Figure 1 though not exhaustive shows the sources of variance in a measurement and the interrelationships between error and tests of model fit or significance The relation of a measurement to the object being measured can be represented as O T E where O variance in the observed measurement of the target T variance in the true value of the target and E random variance or error If the true value of the target is invariant across measurements i e if O E the observed variance will be purely a function of the unreliability of the measuring instrument Conversely if perfectly error free measurement of the target could be assumed i e if E 0 then O T and the observed variance would be purely a function of the temporal stability of the target If E 0 and T 0 the observed variance will be a function of both the temporal stability of the target and of the unreliability of the measuring instrument Measurement error can result from a variety of factors including true variance not captured by a particular measurement strategy which may complicate the interpretation of temporal reliability estimates These other factors include variance due to fluctuations across cycle phases within each woman s menstrual cycle 10 duration of sample storage prior to analysis 11 limitations of the assay multiple analysis batches 10 multiple types of assays 12 and multiple laboratories 10 Ideally estimates of as many sources of error as possible should be included when considering the impact of temporal reliability on measurement strategy The objective of this study was to determine the following for various serum estrogens gonadotropins and urinary sex hormone metabolites the minimum number of repeated measurements required for reliable estimates the ICC s and the amount of true variance accounted for by single measurements Methods Experimental design The data for this study come from a randomized double blind study investigating the effects of a 100 mg day soy isoflavone regimen on estrogen levels in 34 premenopausal women A detailed description of the study design and the results of the intervention were reported in Maskarinec et al 2002 13 The Committee on Human Studies at the University of Hawaii approved the study protocol Written informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to participation The study group consisted of 17 premenopausal women per group Four women left the study before the end of the year and another was able to give only four blood draws for health reasons Eligibility criteria included an age range of 35 46 years an average intake of less than 7 servings of soy foods per week no prior cancer diagnosis except basal cell skin carcinoma no use of oral contraceptives or hormone preparations within the past three months no intention of becoming pregnant within the next year an intact uterus and ovaries self defined regular menstrual periods no serious medical condition Subjects had a mean age of 42 3 years SD 2 6 and a mean weight of 65 6 kg SD 12 8 Subjects were ethnically diverse 18 were Caucasian 6 were Chinese 5 were Japanese 5 were Hawaiian Sample collection Subjects were asked to donate 5 urine and blood samples one at baseline and one after 1 3 6 and 12 months of participation All samples were collected approximately 5 days after the ovulation approximately day 19 in a 28 day cycle Subjects used ovulation kits Ovuquick test kits from Quidel La Jolla CA to determine the time of ovulation This kit detects the mid cycle rise of LH using morning urine with a sensitivity of 35 mIU mL of LH and its predictive validity with respect to ovulation has been estimated as 93 14 Although the use of a minimum progesterone value to exclude data from anovulatory cycles from the analyses helped ensure acquisition of the mid luteal phase samples only 52 of samples were obtained on exactly the 5 thday from ovulation Ninety one percent were obtained between the 4 thand the 6 thday from ovulation Blood samples were drawn at a commercial laboratory in the morning between 7 and 9 o clock to control for circadian rhythm in hormone levels Serum and urine samples were stored at 80 C after separation and aliquoting Serum analysis Hormone assays were conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology University of Southern California Los Angeles CA in the Reproductive Endocrine Research Laboratory The analyses for E 2 free E 2 E 1 E 1 S progesterone SHBG follicle stimulating hormone FSH and LH were conducted in 2 batches Samples of these analytes collected at baseline month 1 and month 3 were analyzed in batch 1 and 6 month and 12 month samples were analyzed in batch 2 one year later E 2 E 1 progesterone FSH LH and SHBG were quantified in serum by specific and sensitive radioimmunoassays RIAs Prior to RIA E 1 and E 2 were first extracted with ethyl acetate hexane 2 3 and then purified by Celite column partition chromatography using ethylene glycol as stationary phase 15 E 1 and E 2 were eluted off the column with 15 and 40 toluene in isooctane respectively 3H E 1 and 3H E 2 were used as internal standards to follow procedural losses FSH and LH levels were determined using an immunoradiometric assay IRMA E 1 S progesterone and SHBG were measured by direct RIAs using kits obtained from Diagnostic Systems Laboratories Webster Texas Free E 2 non SHBG or albumin bound E 2 was determined by calculation using a computerized algorithm described previously 16 The majority of intra assay CVs for all analytes were below 10 Table 1 indicating good quality control in the laboratory They ranged from 0 5 for SHBG to 13 0 in the low concentration range of batch 1 for E 1 Urine analysis Urine samples were analyzed for estrone 3 glucuronide E 1 G pregnanediol 3 glucuronide PDG 16 hydroxyestrone 16 OHE 1 and 2 hydroxyestrone 2 OHE 1 E 1 G and PDG were measured directly in urine by enzyme immunoassay 17 Commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kits Estramet Immuna Care Corporation Bethlehem PA were used to determine levels of 16 OHE 1 and 2 OHE 1 in urine 18 All results are relative to creatinine excretion Statistical analysis The SAS statistical software package version 8 2 SAS Institute Inc Cary NC 1999 2001 was used to perform the statistical analyses All statistics were computed using logged values when raw values were not normally distributed To ensure that all measurements in the analysis were from the same time in the menstrual cycle observations were only included if the concurrent progesterone values were at least 5 ng mL a minimum value after an ovulation has occurred Because analyses for 8 of 12 analytes were conducted in two batches we included consideration of error due to between batch variance in our analysis of the temporal stability of these analytes Therefore estimates of temporal stability for the 8 analytes were calculated for the total number of samples and for the first and second batches separately Two types of estimates of the number of measurement occasions O necessary to obtain an adequately reliable estimate were computed The first the relative type O R includes the between subject variance O R was computed using the formula proposed by Nelson et al 19 where r is the correlation between the observed and the true mean analyte values for an individual over a year s W 2is the within subject variance and s B 2is the between subject variance Setting r to 0 9 results in a calculation of the number of measurement occasions required to obtain an estimate that would account for 0 9 2or 81 of the true variance in the target Ninety five percent confidence intervals 95 CI for O R were computed using a published method 20 The second estimate of the number of measurement occasions necessary to obtain an adequately reliable estimate the absolute type O A includes only within subject variance O A was calculated as where w is the within subject variance 21 By adjusting the denominator this method allows for the desired approximation to the true mean to be specified as a percentage Setting the denominator to 0 2 results in a calculation of the number of occasions required to obtain an estimate that is within 20 of the true mean A SAS macro using Proc Varcomp and Proc Means to produce estimates of O R O A and related statistics is available from the authors ICC s measure the proportion of variance attributable to targets of measurement as a ratio of within subject variance to total variance 22 and are suitable to compare variables of the same measurement class 23 We computed two types of ICC s using the notation developed by Shrout and Fleiss 22 ICC 2 1 was computed for each analyte using all 5 measurement occasions to estimate the temporal reliability of the analyte ICC 2 k was computed between batches to estimate the contribution of between batch variance to the temporal reliability estimate ICC 2 1 was computed as ICC 2 1 where BMS is the between subjects mean square EMS is the error mean square k is the number of observations OMS is the observations mean square and n is the number of subjects 22 ICC 2 k was computed as ICC 2 k We applied the formulas by Shrout and Fleiss 22 to obtain 95 CIs To estimate the percentage of true variance accounted for by a single measurement we assumed that the best available estimate of the true variance was the total variance for all occasions After calculating the Pearson correlation of each occasion with all other occasions we considered the squared average of these correlations as the estimate of the most likely percent of true variance for which a single occasion could account We used the formula where T is the percent of true variance r T is the Pearson correlation of each occasion with the total of all other occasions and o is the number of occasions Results Overall means number of samples and means by measurement occasion for all analytes Table 2 indicate the overall stability for the analytes over one year Although estrogen and progesterone levels were on the average 7 higher and gonadotropins and urinary sex hormone metabolites 10 lower in the intervention than in the control group data not shown none of the differences was even close to statistical significance p values ranged from p 0 16 to p 0 90 for Estrone sulfate and Estrone respectively Because of this homogeneity results in this study were collapsed across experimental groups The decrease in E 2 and E 1 are the result of laboratory drift and were independent of intervention status 13 The measurement occasions required to obtain a reliable estimate differed considerably by analyte Table 3 Using the relative method to account for 81 of the true variance the number of occasions required ranged from O R 0 48 to O R 11 43 for SHBG and E 1 respectively To account for 64 of the true variance the number of occasions ranged from O R 0 20 to O R 4 77 for SHBG and E 1 respectively Using the absolute method the number of occasions required to obtain an estimate to within 20 of the true mean ranged from O A 0 34 to O A 10 27 for E 2 and PDG respectively It appears that except for SHBG and E 1 S using a single measurement for any of the analytes in this analysis may be problematic for the typical purposes of epidemiological research because the results of typical epidemiological research center on analyses of the mean value obtained from one group vs the mean value obtained from another e g a group of cases or an intervention group vs a control group Figures 2to 4illustrate the different relationship of between to within subject variance and the corresponding difference between O R and O A In the case of SHBG Figure 2 within subject variance is small relative to between subject variance There is little variation within subjects relative to the variation between subjects resulting in small O R and O A estimates 0 48 and 1 78 respectively The PDG values Figure 3 illustrate the case in which within subject variation is high and overlap one another considerably resulting in relatively large O R and O A estimates 5 17 and 10 27 respectively Finally Figure 4depicts the case in which within subject variance is small but so is the variance between subjects In this case the small within subject variance results in a small O A estimate 0 34 but because the within subject variance is not small relative to the between subject variance the O R is relatively large 8 26 Because ICC s include both within and between subject variance ICC s closely followed O R rather than O A estimates ICC 2 1 ranged from ICC 2 1 0 30 to ICC 2 1 0 88 for LH and SHBG respectively Table 3 The intraclass correlation coefficient ICC s for absolute agreement between the two analysis batches ranged from ICC 2 1 0 47 to ICC 2 1 0 96 for E 1 and SHBG respectively Table 4 Estimates of ICC s were generally consistent across batches with similar estimates based on analysis of all 5 occasions and for estimates based on each batch The between batch ICC for E 1 however was less than 0 5 suggesting that the batch 1 ICC may be a better indicator than the ICC based on all samples The percent of true variance accounted for by a single measurement ranged from 29 to 92 for LH and SHBG respectively Discussion We have provided estimates to the minimum number of measurement occasions required to ensure adequate reliability for two types of experimental aims Analyses in epidemiologic studies involve calculations in which between subject as well as within subject variance is important Therefore O R will usually be the appropriate index of the minimum number of occasions needed to obtain a reliable estimate Estimates of O R based on our sample suggest that only SHBG and E 1 S had sufficient temporal stability to be adequately reliable with a single measurement when the desired amount of variance to account for was set as low as 64 A single measurement of any of the other analytes would be unlikely to account for even 50 of the true variance For cases in which the within subject variance is the only variance of interest e g when the measured value of an analyte will be compared with a fixed standard O A will be the appropriate index The omission of between subject variance from the formula for calculating this statistic produces very different results from O R Several of the analytes that were adequately reliable with a single measurement or very few measurements when between subject variance was a factor required higher numbers of measures when only within subject variance was involved and vice versa This study confirms previous findings that SHBG may be reliably measured in premenopausal women using a single occasion It also indicates that E 1 S may be reliably measured using one sample only More importantly our results suggest that none of the other analytes examined meet minimal reliability requirements that would permit confidence in single measures These results are in agreement with the wide range if ICCs reported in previous studies 4 5 6 Our conclusions are limited to the collection of samples at midluteal phase however and may not generalize to other phases of the menstrual cycle The use of ICC s to estimate the agreement between analysis batches differs from their use as an index of temporal reliability The appropriate type of ICC for this purpose uses a mean of several values rather than single values and is typically higher than that calculated using single values Though the ICC s between batches were higher than those estimating temporal reliability they were relatively low demonstrating the importance of measuring all samples in one batch when possible As was previously noted 11 error due to time in storage will affect estimates of temporal reliability Analyzing in multiple batches is one means of decreasing this source of error but runs the risk of increasing error due to multiple batches Until better estimates of the impact of storage time on each of these analytes are available however it will be difficult to draw conclusions about whether error due to multiple analysis batches or error due to storage time has the more detrimental effect on temporal reliability Several sources of error are effectively beyond researchers capacity to control For example the validity and reliability of the best assay available for measuring a given analyte cannot be increased through improving study design Other sources of error however can be dramatically reduced through the use of appropriate designs These strategies may include increasing the sample size to reduce the impact of random error analyzing all samples in one batch and using a sufficient number of repeated measures to obtain an adequately reliable estimate It is also possible though not uncontroversial to control error statistically by correcting for attenuation using validation data 24 Several improvements in addition to a larger sample and more repeated measures would have increased confidence in the results of our study First if the effects of storage time on the analytes were known we could have taken into account the contributions of this source of variance to our temporal reliability estimates and distinguished its impact from that due to assay reliability Second obtaining blood and urine samples on day 5 following ovulation was most appropriate for the measurement of progesterone and near optimal for SHBG but may not have been the best day to obtain estimates of the other analytes 25 Third though our data were drawn from an intervention study in which no results approached significance a more clearly homogeneous sample would have been preferable Fourth variation in menstrual cycle length and variance due to pulsatility of excretion were additional sources of error Finally our estimates were based on targets that changed across measurements and we could not assume error free measurements Consequently we were not able to precisely distinguish between the contributions of assay reliability and the contributions of each analyte s natural variability to our estimates of temporal reliability However despite some limitations this study provided significant new insights into the variability of sex hormones gonadotropins and urinary hormone metabolites in premenopausal women during a one year period Our estimates of temporal reliability represent the combined computation of the consistency of a measure across repeated measurements and the temporal fluctuations in the target of measurement Conclusions Given the relatively large sample size for this analysis and the strictly controlled protocol to collect samples on the same day of the menstrual cycle our results will be useful for designing future research projects exploring the role of sex hormones in the etiology of cancer and other diseases Competing
