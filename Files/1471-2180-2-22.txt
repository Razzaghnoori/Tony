 Background The detection of microbial life in extraterrestrial locations is an important goal of human exploration of space because of ecological and health concerns about possible contamination of other planets with earthly organisms and vice versa 1 2 Several indirect methods for detecting extraterrestrial life have been proposed in the prior literature These include a examining the ratios of stable isotopes in important elements such as carbon and sulphur for discrimination against heavy isotopes and selective use of the lighter isotopes b microscopic observations of highly organized or specifically shaped structures 3 4 c examination of soils for the presence of specific types of organic moieties 5 and d the detection of chiral molecules in extraterrestrial samples 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Previously we suggested a thermodynamic approach to the detection of life Since living entities require a continual source of usable energy we should be able to detect a chemical signature of life in the form of mixtures of redox molecules such as porphyrins quinones and flavins that transport electrons along redox gradients between electron donors and acceptors 13 We examined methods to extract and detect the components of electron transport chains that might be used to indicate the presence of life on site in extraterrestrial locations Our experiments showed this to be a promising approach though instrument development and miniaturization for this purpose will be challenging 14 Here we discuss the possibility of a related but simpler approach for detecting life that will measure the actual existence of functioning electron transport chains This can theoretically be done remotely and on site using robotically collected extraterrestrial soil samples The method involves detection of actual activity of respiratory electron transport using artificial electron acceptors such as DCIP and tetrazolium dyes such as XTT DCIP for example couples directly with NADH or NADPH to form DCIPH 2 and NAD or NADP making it an ideal electron transport chain indicator 15 XTT has been used to measure microbial respiratory activity in complex natural environments 16 Respiratory dyes have been used commercially for many years in the Biolog system to help identify pure cultures of microorganisms by their patterns of oxidation of multiple organic substrates 17 Biolog also has been used to characterize oxidation capabilities of soil microbial communities 18 Rodriquez et al 19 used the redox dye 5 cyano 2 3 ditolyl tetrazolium chloride CTC for direct epifluorescent microscopic enumeration of respiring bacteria in environmental samples The oxidized form of CTC is nearly colorless and non fluorescent Oxidized CTC was observed to be reduced by biological electron transport systems forming a fluorescent insoluble CTC formazan The formazan accumulated intracellularly and could be visualized by epifluorescence microscopy in wet mount preparations on polycarbonate membrane filter surfaces or directly in some biofilms Thus coupled with more limited analyses for specific electron transport molecules e g porphyrins or quinones the use of respiratory dyes for detection of active electron transport in the biological redox range could provide very convincing evidence for life in extraterrestrial locations This approach would obviously only detect presently living entities but these could include dormant life forms such as spores that might germinate and grow using added nutrients Results Examination of the presence of a chemical signature of life in various soils Figure 1presents the results of a comparison of supercritical carbon dioxide extractions of control heat treated at 600 C and life positive unheated Idaho red sand soils We confirmed the structures of the compounds shown as marked peaks by their respective UV VIS and mass spectra The supercritical carbon dioxide SCCO 2 extracts of Idaho red sand Figure 1 and a Lake Boney Basin Antarctica soil which contained relatively few bacteria Table 1 showed detectable signature molecules in the extracted samples using either a diode array detector or an amperometric detector Figure 1 The sterile soil after heat treatment did not yield significant amounts of our targeted redox signature molecules nicotinamide riboflavin Q 0 FMN FAD and porphyrin Figure 1 To confirm that soil samples yielding negative results and those yielding signatures of redox moieties were different because of the presence and absence of biological entities we counted viable organisms and extracted DNA from the heated control sand a Beacon Valley Antarctic soil a Lake Boney Basin Antarctic soil and the Idaho red sand Table 1 There were small amounts of organic compounds in the extract of the Beacon Valley soil but none matching our standards no redox signature At a detection limit of 1 ng per gram of soil DNA was absent from the control and the Beacon Valley soil as were cultivable bacteria Soils that contained electron transport moieties e g the Idaho red sand and Lake Boney Basin soil also contained both DNA and cultivable bacteria Redox dye reduction by various soils Figure

surrogate soil Idaho red sand Figure 4shows results of XTT reduction by the control soil and the life positive Idaho red sand Figure 5shows results of XTT reduction by the control and the life positive Boney Basin Antarctica soil The Beacon Valley Antarctica soil did not reduce either dye As another control Figure 6shows the reduction of XTT by a pure culture of Pseudomonas putida Discussion Energy use by living organisms directs our experimental design for seeking signs of extraterrestrial life In terrestrial biological systems energy is tapped via stepwise electron transport between electron donors and acceptors via an electron transport chain Applying this principle universally we should be able to detect the chemical components of electron transport chains or electron transport itself as a signature of life Our assumptions about the centrality of electron transport processes to life led us to a direct experimental approach for detection of life We were able to measure actual electron transport in the redox range between 1 0 and 1 0 V in a microbe poor soil in the presence of air and both with and without additions of an electron donor dilute nutrient broth The respiratory electron accepting dyes DCIP and XTT were used to short circuit microbial electron transport and this was observed dye reduction by visible spectroscopy This method might entail some site specific challenges in environments that are different from those on Earth especially in developing appropriate controls for abiotic processes NASA learned this lesson from the Viking biology mission to Mars In the Viking s gas exchange experiment water vapor exposed to the Martian soil released O 2 but possibly only as a result of the activity of powerful soil oxidants that also might have been responsible for the chemical reactivity seen in other Viking biology experiments 20 A molecule such as DCIP or XTT might be destroyed by oxidation in the presence of such soils However soil samples taken from borings beneath the surface which is exposed to high energy oxidant generating ultraviolet radiation or from other protected areas might not be so destructive of organic compounds Such stability problems should not be of such concern for extraterrestrial sites such as Europa or Titan Thus our ability confirmed here to detect actual electron transport within the redox potential range of life processes and to observe simultaneously some of the signature chemical structures involved offers a promising direct approach to detecting the capability of living entities in soil on Earth or elsewhere in our solar system to move electrons between universal donors and acceptors and obtain energy to support replication Since we are not yet able to test this approach extraterrestrially we validated our proposed detection method using pure microbial cultures and microbe poor soils collected on Earth A select group of signature chemicals were extracted from an organic poor soil Figure 1 and identified with instruments that eventually can be miniaturized for use on space exploration missions 13 21 22 Actual electron transport by living cells was confirmed by use of two specific dyes DCIP and XTT that short circuit respiratory electron transport chains This was demonstrated using a pure strain of the common earthly soil microorganism Pseudomonas putida Figure 6 and with native soil microorganisms within two nutrient supplemented soil matrixes Figures 3 4 5 We easily detected a signature of biological electron transport within a biologically poor sandy soil containing about 30 000 cultivable cells per gram Idaho red sand and also from a soil from the extreme environment of Lake Boney Basin Antarctica Table 1 Though the Boney Basin soil readily reduced XTT it only very slowly reduced DCIP data not shown and the rate of reduction was not significantly different between untreated soil and killed controls Since DCIP and XTT have different redox potentials and XTT in our work appears to generally be more easily reduced by soil microbial communities this shows a need to use more than one respiratory dye in this type of experiment Our observations also indicate that in soils from extreme environments one may expect differences in their patterns of dye reduction that probably reflect differences in their community phylogenetic compositions A soil from Beacon Valley Antarctica that showed no DNA at our detection limit also showed no dye reduction activity with either dye This soil appears to be sterile by our method of life detection certainly it contains fewer microbial cells than our detection limit Further investigations of this soil are thus warranted For the Idaho red sand assuming 30 000 cells represent about 1 of actual biomass in the soil the detection limit of our method should be about 3 000 000 cells g Though the amount of DNA observed in the Lake Boney Basin soil was actually higher than seen in the Idaho red sand the microbial counts were lower Table 1 This shows once again the limitation of viable counts which only count organisms that grow on the specific medium employed It is well known that most bacteria in nature cannot be cultured Our work indicates there is probably a more dominant non cultivable microbial community in the Antarctic soil compared to the Idaho soil since DNA analysis indicated high numbers of microorganisms that were not reflected in viable count data We need to improve the current detection limit for organic moieties Figure 1 estimated at 3 10 6cells per gram of soil Processing larger quantities of soil could easily increase sensitivity for detection of redox molecules Supplementing soils with appropriate electron donors and acceptors could stimulate extensive growth of low numbers of indigenous organisms In theory even a few cells gram of soil might be detected using this approach The former procedure might be accomplished by using a flow through soil extractor that could receive multiple soil additions and concentrate the extracted residues prior to downstream analysis The latter procedure could be implemented by using a microtiter plate format similar that employed by Biolog where hundreds of potential electron donors could be examined simultaneously and the results dye reduction read by an on board UV visible spectral scanner designed for scanning microtiter plates Examples of donor acceptor combinations might include simple sugars and or amino acids or other organic molecules in the presence of oxygen or nitrate organisms capable of heterotrophic respiration hydrogen and ferric ions or oxidized iron minerals chemoautotrophic hydrogen oxidizers organic acids and ferric ions or oxidized iron minerals heterotrophic iron reducers bicarbonate carbonate and trace minerals in the presence and absence of light photosynthetic organisms carbon dioxide and a reduced metal such as ferrous ions chemoautotrophs ammonium ion and bicarbonate carbonate ammonia oxidizers etc The combinations could be adapted to the environment under study such as Mars perhaps an iron dominated energy system In this work we emphasized that during validation on Earth of any life detection method there is a requirement for control measurements that corroborate earthly results of assays that might be carried out remotely on other planets We chose measurements of DNA present in all earthly life and readily cultivable bacteria present in most earthly soils for validating our specific redox chemistry based approach In the future as we and others work to increase the sensitivity of this life detection approach toward values needed for the extreme environments on Earth and places such as the regolith of Mars the simple controls we used should be supplemented by a number of others These could include controls such as direct microscopic counts of active and inactive bacteria 19 extraction and quantitation of ATP 23 extraction and analysis of fatty acids 24 real time PCR of universal 16S rDNA markers 25 and or use of a larger variety of culture media including dilute organic media in place of or in addition to plate count agar 26 All of these approaches also have problems such as the possible presence in soil of biological molecules that are not associated with living cells the always present inability of microbiologists to culture most of the bacteria present in soil and the often unpredictable performance of PCR primers However the sum of such multiple controls would build toward ultimate confidence in the sensitivity of this or any other life detection technique Because there is great diversity among habitats for microbial life on the Earth and sterility of an earthly soil is rare it would be desirable to examine as many as possible of these environments to determine the absolute reliability of our techniques for use extraterrestrially Unfortunately we cannot sample all possible terrestrial environments on Earth or even a small fraction of them We feel the diversity we have examined is sufficient to indicate the value of our approach particularly since one of these extreme environments we did examine Beacon Valley Antarctica appears to be sterile We also cannot examine all known heterotrophic bacteria stored in culture collections to confirm that all or most of them effect dye reduction However the many years of experience using the Biolog system which employs respiratory dyes to indicate microbial metabolism 17 18 is strong support for our hypothesis that respiratory dye reduction is a robust and conclusive assay for heterotrophic life in soil Further validation efforts may show that observation of redox cycling of artificial electron acceptors of appropriate redox potentials may be sufficient in itself as a signature of life greatly simplifying instrumentation requirements for extraterrestrial missions in our solar system and beyond Conclusions Coupled with limited analyses for specific electron transport molecules e g porphyrins and or quinones the use of respiratory dyes for detection of electron transport in the biological redox range could provide very convincing evidence for life in extraterrestrial locations Methods Signature chemicals As detailed in our prior work 13 the following compounds were used as representative examples of electron transport chain components

adenine dinucleotide FAD and DCIP were purchased from Sigma St Louis MO 2 3 Dimethoxy 5 methyl 4 benzoquinone coenzyme Q 0 was purchased from Fluka Buchs Switzerland XTT was purchased from TCI America Inc Portland OR The other chemicals and solvents used were of the highest available purity Soils Natural sand from dune areas of southern Idaho Idaho red sand poor in organic content and rich in oxidized iron minerals was used as a life positive soil and surrogate for extraterrestrial soils As a control we used cleaned highly pure silica sand purchased from Fisher Scientific These soils are described in our previous paper 13 Other extraterrestrial surrogate soils were collected from Beacon Valley and Lake Boney Basin Antarctica The soil from Beacon Valley was from an area where higher organisms such as nematodes have never been observed Extraction of soil organic moieties Soil samples of 5 to 15 g were used for supercritical fluid extraction SFE with supercritical CO 2 SCCO 2 Samples were first hydrolyzed in 5 to 10 ml of acetone containing 2 M NH 4 OH under ultrasound agitation water bath at 160 watts for 1 h at room temperature Nitrogen blown over the sample then evaporated the solvents The SFE extraction was performed with the dry sample within one day to avoid any degradation of redox compounds A piece of Whatman glass fiber filter paper 1 0 m pore size was cut into a 0 8 cm diameter circle and placed at the outlet end of a 10 ml SFE extraction cell to retain large particles A hydrolyzed sample 10 ml was then packed into the vessel until it was full Exactly 1 0 ml of 25 v v trimethylamine in methanol as modifier was added to the sample and the vessel was immediately connected to the SFE system The extraction pressure was set at 300 atm the oven temperature at 35 C and the outlet valve temperature at 60 C After a 15 min static extraction a dynamic extraction was started until approximately 30 ml of liquid CO 2 passed through the SFE cell 27 The flow rate was controlled at 5 to 10 ml min by the outlet valve In order to achieve maximum recovery the SFE procedure was repeated again under identical conditions Chromatography Separations were performed using a Hewlett Packard HP 1090 HPLC Avondale PA Samples of 20 to 50 L were injected onto a Discovery Amide C16 or Discovery C18 reverse phase column 15 cm 4 6 mm 5 m Supelco Bellefonte PA and analytes were separated using the ion pair chromatographic method Solvent A was 5 mM tetrabutylammonium phosphate 30 mM KH 2 PO 4 and 4 acetonitrile V V Solvent B was 100 acetonitrile Runs were performed over 35 min with gradient elution of 0 to 40 B then with static elution over 35 to 40 min with 60 A 40 B followed by 40 to 42 min with 100 A and a post run wash of 5 min at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 28 Detectors used were a tandem diode array detector DAD and dual carbon electrode amperometric detector ECD Electrospray tandem mass spectrometry The identities of signature species present in extracts were confirmed by negative or positive electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry Quattro II Micromass Ltd UK Samples were delivered into the source at a flow rate of 5 l min using a syringe pump Harvard Apparatus South Natick MA or directly from a HPLC column with effluent from the column split 1 100 A potential of 2 5 to 3 kV was applied to the electrospray needle The sample cone was kept at an average of 15 V The counter electrode skimmer and RF radio frequency lens potentials were tuned to maximize the ion beam for a given solvent The resolution of the detector was 15 000 and the source temperature was kept constant at 80 C The instrument was calibrated using a polyethylene glycol solution All spectra were an average of 10 to 15 scans Biomass and DNA analysis in soil The numbers of cultivable soil microorganisms were estimated by standard plate count and serial dilution methods Standard plate count medium PCM was used to culture bacteria from soil samples 29 DNA was extracted from different soils using the FastPrep DNA spin kit from Qbiogene Inc Carlsbad CA The concentration of DNA was estimated by measuring fluorescence at 520 nm Fluorescence was measured after staining the sample with Pico Green fluorescent dye Molecular Probes Eugene OR Our detection limit was about 1 ng of DNA in 1 g of soil DCIP and XTT reduction assays Working in a sterile laminar flow hood we added 2 0 g of soil 16 0 mL of sterile 100 mM phosphate buffer pH 7 5 2 mL of 100X Nutrient Broth as a biological reductant Difco and 1 0 mL of 1 mM DCIP to a sterile 25 mL serum bottle Bottles were plugged and capped with sterile closures and shaken at room temperature for required experimental time Periodically samples 1 0 mL were removed aseptically and centrifuged to remove solids The absorbance of the filtrate was measured at 600 nm Concentrations of DCIP oxidized were calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 21 0 10 3M 1cm 1 Reoxidation of DCIPH 2 was negligible under our experimental conditions Samples were run in triplicate Reduction of XTT was monitored similarly as described for DCIP except we measured the increase in absorbance at 465 nm resulting from reduction of the colorless oxidized dye to an orange product 16 Authors contributions All authors worked within a multidisciplinary team RLC conceived the study and participated in its
