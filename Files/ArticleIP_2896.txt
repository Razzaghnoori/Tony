 Where Have You Gone Oscar Hammerstein The subtitle of Geoffrey Block s new book tells you the whole story Enchanted Evenings The Broadway Musical From Show Boat to Sondheim For some of us that s not progress In 70 years what was once the mighty Mississippi of American popular culture an ol man river that seemed set to jes keep rollin along forever has shriveled away to one toxic little stream on a dry barren mud flat You can measure the difference between Show Boat and Sondheim in a thousand ways but a Los Angeles Times column earlier this year is as good a way as any Defending the cause of Ebonics Professor Ron Emmons of Los Angeles City College asserts among other fancies that Black English is in Negro spirituals Dat Ole Man River Ah Got Shoes Ol Man River is not a Negro spiritual It s a show tune cooked up in 1927 by a couple of middle class honkies who needed something for a spot in the first act Yes Oscar Hammerstein s lyric is full of dat and dese obviously he was self taught at Ebonics but funnily enough when Paul Robeson sang the song in the London production of Show Boat in 1928 the biggest problem he had was wrapping his beautiful impeccable vowels around the soi disant dialect lyric Ever since most black singers have preferred to sing That Ol Man River If I were a sweating stevedore on the levee out by Los Angeles City College it would be sorely tempting to mock the professor Ol man Emmons Dat ol man Emmons He mus know sumpin He don check nothin But in a way he has a point albeit not the one he thinks he s making Hammerstein s is an unobtrusive craft an artless art Ol Man River was the song in which he first found his lyrical voice compressing the suffering resignation and anger of an entire race into 24 taut lines and doing it so naturally that it s no wonder folks assume the song s a Negro spiritual If it s any consolation to Emmons Hammerstein s very last lyric Edelweiss from The Sound of Music is invariably assumed to be a real Austrian folk song indeed a few years back the White House went further playing it at a state banquet for the Austrian president under the impression that it was the country s national anthem The great strength of these songs one of the reasons they seep into our collective consciousness is that they barely seem written at all Geoffrey Block professor of music at the University of Puget Sound School of Music in Tacoma Wash is determined to change all that Enchanted Evenings is less concerned with enchantment than with the painstaking artistic judgments that lead to it So here he is getting stuck in to Show Boat In the thrice repeated opening phrase of Where s the Mate for Me the first shown in Example 2 5a Who cares if my boat goes up stream and two statements of I drift along with my fancy Kern ingeniously varies the harmony of the final melodic note D Example 2 5b and c Its first appearance on the words upstream the third measure is paradoxically the lowest note of the phrase after all the point is that Ravenal does not care whether he is going upstream or downstream Here Kern harmonizes the tonic or central key D with a conventional tonic D major triad In the third measure of the next statement Example 2 5b Kern sets the word fancy with a fancy and deceptive resolution to a minor triad on the sixth degree of the scale On the final statement of this phrase Example 2 5c moments before Ravenal hears Magnolia s piano theme and Kern displays his fanciest chord again on the word fancy Ah they don t write em like that anymore There s only one problem with Block s approach That s not how it happened In 99 percent of his songs Jerome Kern s music was written before the words and he was notorious for declining to accommodate his lyricists no extra notes so that an ingenious word might be made to fit and certainly no concessions to literal meaning in his melody or harmony He didn t set the word fancy at all and that fanciest chord was there long before Hammerstein fixed the words to those notes It s possible that Hammerstein coming upon the lowest note of the phrase thought Hey I ll write upstream there How s that for a paradox but I doubt it That s not the way the ear hears music and Hammerstein was too sensitive a lyricist to be so numbingly literal Herbert Kretzmer one of the lyricists of Les Mis rables put it to me this way It s a question of finding what Johnny Mercer called the sound of the music You re trying to capture something as elusive as a sound which suggests a word from which eventually a complete lyric emerges Still you can t blame Block for trying He s coming at it from the conservatory end of things and if you re used to opera the union of words and music in American song must take your breath away Operas have plots and lyrics But the words have no relationship to the music Or to put it the other way round the music takes no account of the words La donna mobile The worst Tin Pan Alley hack wouldn t give so much weight to the definite article because he d know it was the most insignificant word in the line But Verdi He couldn t give a hoot Insofar as he gives the lyrics a thought it s only to say Stand well back boys I m flyin Good musicals are both specific and universal But they re specific because the words fit the shape of the tune not because the tune is a translation of the words the method Block appears to favor Here he is banging on with his upstream downstream high note low note approach again I n You re the Top Porter does not capitalize on the text s potential for realism Although the I always appears in the bottom throughout most of the song the you blithely moves back and forth from top to bottom The upward leaping orchestral figure anticipates the word top but the sung line does not and at the punchline But if Baby I m the bottom You re the top both Billy and Reno I m and You re share a melodic line at the top of their respective ranges Phew That entire paragraph deserves a rousing chorus of You re the Pits With his fixation on tops and bottoms Block s beginning to sound like the gay personal ads in the Village Voice Unlike Kern with his top paradoxically on his bottom poor old Porter gets no credit for having his bottom paradoxically on his top Block s so busy following the vocal score that he s not hearing the song For nonmusicologists that upward leaping orchestral figure he mentions is the bit that goes Plink plink You re the top Plink plinketty plink plink You re the Coliseum Not only is You re the Top one of the few songs where the little orchestral fill ins are an intrinsic part of the song but more than that the fill ins actually are the song The sung bits paradoxically are the fill ins little conversational lyric phrases that fall in the gaps between the plinketty plinks If you know that good for you if you don t it doesn t matter But how could you sit down and analyze the thing and fail to notice it As to the bottoms winding up on top as a self contained composer lyricist Porter knew enough to let a good strong lyric thrust set itself How could Block be so Block headed as to think that But if Baby I m the bottom You re the top could possibly be improved by putting I m and bottom on low notes It s the relative musical monotony of the phrase that makes it so insistent so driving and such a brilliantly effective cap to the song It s the punch line it s the exclamation point How sad that Block for all his technical ability can t hear that So maybe we re better off with ol man Emmons and the White House misattributing Hammerstein s work to dirt poor cotton pickers and lonely goatherds than with Block s misguided praise In great popular art after all you notice the art not the artist Which brings us to Block s final chapter Stephen Sondheim One reason Ol Man River is a powerful memorable lyric is that there s no rhyme until the eighth and 10 th lines Hammerstein rhymes when the song requires it a lesson his pupil Sondheim has forgotten In Into the Woods the mother of Jack as in the beanstalk tells her son to sell the family cow because We ve no time to sit and dither While her withers wither with her We re back to the pre Hammerstein era you re distanced from the character because all you can hear is the voice of the author Sondheim has given us plotless musicals Company and characterless musicals Pacific Overtures and pointillist musicals Sunday in the Park With George and musicals that go backward Merrily We Roll Along but for all the supposed range and depth and variety what you mainly notice about these musicals is Sondheim It s the triumph of the artist over the art the man who knows more than anyone else about musicals except how to write one where you don t notice how much he knows the one subject who repays Block s analytical approach if only because that seems his natural home I think of Good Thing Going his wonderfully brooding ballad from Merrily with its expert title resolution We had a good thing going Going Gone And with Sondheim it is gone
