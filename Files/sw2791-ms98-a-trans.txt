        okay official time well what do you think of about the budget here you first   oh well i think it needs some drastic uh drastic drastic help  um   oh yeah   i i think theres a lot of waste that that could uh that would be cut out if we could get uh politicians to be less less of politicians um and um i i think it needs to be given a really high priority because i i think it has a horrible effect on the economy and and what we can do as a country and everything else   i know that were affected uh directly uh at TI because of uh the defense budget cuts but i certainly think thats one of the the things that theyre doing already which is uh which which was  needed to be done for probably the last few years uh   sure right yeah   although with the Russian situation and all the world situation changing the way it is uh it certainly needed i the obvious one that people all talk about that i still dont understand is uh im at work let me turn my radio off here uh is uh all the foreign aid i you know its over its a fifty years roughly since World War II   yeah yeah   i dont understand why were i understand that we support Israel and all the other countries but why do we have to give them cash rather than just selling them military things at a discount or something i dont get the idea the idea of giving people three billion dollars a year   yeah right i i have a hard time with that too now i can understand uh for instance the uh the situation in say the Philippines where they needed some cash to jump start their economy   yeah   but i dont see where we i mean i think its crazy to be just pouring money into an economy thats obviously mismanaged for instance um   right well i think that we should give humanitarian aid and thats it   right   you know i think we can loan food or or relief relief aid or whatever you want to call it but i   yeah right   not cash money i think you can send them wheat in other  words i think that helps farmers but   right   to send them money i dont i dont   yeah   see under any circumstances where you send anybody money   im not sure i understand the i i guess theres a a a reason for that and i i just dont know enough about it to understand the sense of it because its not an obvious i i mean on the surface theres no obvious reason why we should be doing that   right   i have to agree with you there   im amazed that neither neither party or or the which i guess theyre independent parties too why they dont talk about it i mean they dont bring it up at all why you would think theyd be real having a real campaign with one party or the other   right yeah   and they never talk about it they just keep doing it you know   yeah that theres some kind of justification there and i dont know what it is and i dont know if i agree with it or not yeah   i i just like to hear them talk about it you know i like to hear some of the congressmen or senators at least   right   say well lets lets bring this before lets examine every one of our foreign aids   right   and look like like they did with the defense with the military bases they they investigated all those rightfully wrongly wrongfully whether which ones should be closed i dont know   right   at least they looked at it i think they should look at foreign aid and say hey which ones do we not need to give you know   right well you know the the the other thing is that you have all this this this all this partisan politics where you have a person whos representing a particular state and he says well my my state it would advantageous if the  if the United States spent money to uh you know to investigate uh potato blithe or something you know and thats and there is tons of that and   right yeah i know that is amazing   and that is just a horrible waste of money i think and its and its done because some constituent  you know i  well its done because they want to impress the the people that are going to vote for him next month   umhum   and uh if if there was a way to get around that and i think i think some of that could be avoided if we put uh uh a finite term on on some of these peoples um uh  uh you know stay in office um   oh i agree with you there   i i think they would have they wouldnt have time to i mean theyd have to i think their incentive would be to go out uh or and making their mark on history and they wouldnt even be wasting their time on little piddly stuff thats just draining draining money uh instead theyd concentrate on doing something that was significant um i would hope so anyway   yeah i saw one about a month or so ago on Twenty Twenty i think it was where one of the congressmen i think it was from Connecticut and i probably will will screw that up but   yeah   he wanted to start        another drug headquarters in his state and no one was asking for it but him        and he got the money approved got it approved by tagging it on to some other bill   yeah   and it didnt you know the the newsman asked him what what no one is asking for this why do you you know and it was just totally a boondoggle i mean it was just uh him wanting to build something that nobody wanted   yeah sure right well thats thats you know thats the catch word these days is drug you know drug fight drug   right right   i mean he got himself   but the drug agency wasnt asking for it he was asking for it you know which didnt make any sense at all     yeah  i dont know  he it looked can look good on his resume resume   right       it is amazing how the the congressmen and senators just start are totally in another world once they get elected   yeah yeah oh yeah and well you know its like ive ive really gotten cynical i guess as ive gotten older but ive ive been watching you know the the campaigns and stuff and its it just its just amazing how little anybody really says   right or well duh i thought you were going to say what they do   oh that too   i ive been trying to go over in my own mind when they say were gonna really if you vote for me were gonna control crime and drugs they dont do anything nothing they dont have they had any president or anybody every done anythin g against crime and drugs you know   right right well no no i mean and because its you know  and its because nothing is black and white   right   you know you just cant go up and go up there and say well were going to were going to stop crime now   right yeah exactly   if it were that simple somebody would have done it a long time ago   right exactly   and thats what kind you know they theres the people that says well well well never raise taxes or we will raise taxes or you know its like the guy who says youre never going to raise taxes doesnt isnt realistic about what he sees about what hes doing the guy who says well we should raise taxes   right   will raise them but but it will all it the money will not help anything thats what kills me um  you know the for instance here here in Texas theyre talking about uh an income tax well i could almost support an income tax if they reduced or got rid of the sales tax   right yeah you cant double up yeah   but nobodys talking about that they want both you know  no i know and they never go away they just get higher and theres more of them you know   exactly exactly they never go away the the funniest thing i heard lately about politicians uh joke was uh uh do you know how you can tell it when a politician is lying       his lips are moving     yeah my favorite yeah yeah yeah my favorite one about politicians is that a politicians a person whos made it to the top because he didnt have what it takes to make it at the bottom   that that that that see that covers is all you know right yeah but it it is the budget thing is just and i dont know why they dont talk about it logically its always always uh   yeah   again the only thing i guess theyre doing logically now is the defense which is certainly hurting TI to a degree although weve done so well with the   yeah   Gulf War we got a lot of good positive press with all the exotic uh weapon systems and i think well get a lot of those you know but uh   right yeah   uh you you need to close so many bases and you need to cut out some missiles or i mean some uh programs and all   right   uh and theyre doing that i think thats thats really good even though it it hurts a lot bit you know   well yeah the the problem is that the budget is so complicated and what theyre doing are the things that are easy theyre making the easy choices     well then thats probably true   and and uh um and its and i think part of it is that the budget you know the the economy and the budget is too complicated for a lot of the politicians i mean they cant comprehend um you know what it takes what it needs they just dont have the expertise the other thing is they cant its too   umhum   uh its not in their political career interest to make some of the hard decisions that are going to need to be made   right   uh and so what you do is you do the obvious things you know and and they they dont really help all that much i mean sure they help some and im sure   right i dont go ahead i was going to say i know you mentioned it but i dont know why we cant change the laws where there the congress and the senators just have eight years or or terms because the president has it   right   and i think that uh is you know you dont want someone in there forever   right   and the congressmen go in there forever and thats thats their whole life then   right right   and their familys life and every one of their relatives gets on it has got a job you know its ridiculous   yeah well uh you know i think uh its got to come from the you know its its got to be you know there certainly the politicians arent going to introduce that as a bill so so so you know if something like thats going to happen its usually because somebodys   right there you go there you go   you know somebody has gotten angry enough and has got the time an the energy to to you know have to to develop something from the from the you know ground swell level you know where you get a petition up and you you know get signatures and you call for a referendum and its not easy its not easy   no thats true maybe that longterm though i think that is a a factor that is to keep the our government uh rotating you know keep them moving uh   yeah   and not get the career politicians huh   right   yeah theres uh historians i thought that keep saying will that that never was meant that the politicians would make a career it was just something that you would serve like in the military   right   and then youd be done you know   thats right well you know it and and what was supposed to be uh so healthy about our our former government is that these were regular people who were who you know these were the doctors and the lawyers and the accountants and the janitors and the uh who were in there for their brief period of time to do their to to to serve proudly and   right right right right right
