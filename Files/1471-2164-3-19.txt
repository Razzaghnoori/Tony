 Background Microarrays are a powerful tool to investigate differential gene expression of thousands of genes of a cell type tissue or organism 1 2 While traditional microarray experiments strive to establish the global view of the activity of all genes i e the genome in response to environmental conditions they may also be used to characterize and quantitatively describe gene expression behavior of a selected set of genes as a true genotypic correlate of a particular phenotype Application targeted arrays and array reagents are already commercially available Operon Clontech Incyte Pharmaceuticals Affymetrix for research in diverse areas such as cancer stress and aging toxicology hematology cell cycle neurology and apoptosis Contrary to genome wide chips custom fabricated microarrays are less expensive and more readily adapted to the economically sensitive environment of the molecular diagnostics laboratory where relatively few interrogations are relevant for clinical investigation of a patient specimen Because typical microarray results are usually burdened with substantial amounts of noise 3 rigorous statistical methods must be applied to interpretation of data Methods for systematically addressing noise in the analysis of the microarray data are only beginning to be described 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Such noise in microarray experiments may arise from non specific hybridization of the labeled samples to elements printed on the microarray print tip effects slide inhomogeneities and variability in RNA isolation purity labeling and detection 6 9 10 11 12 Among these hybridization variance contributes most significantly to the overall variation 12 Non specific hybridization can be measured through the use of specificity controls on the microarray and addressed as a statistical problem 8 13 The most common strategy in microarray experiments is to focus on fluorescent signal ratios in two color competitive hybridization experiments The problem with using ratio data alone is that it does not take into account the absolute signal intensity measurements used to calculate the ratios While this approach may work adequately for ratios of moderate to highly expressed genes that yield bright fluorescent signals weak signals arising from low transcript levels may be masked or biased by noise non specific hybridization Non specific hybridization is a characteristic of cDNA microarray hybridization and may be attributed to the uniform hybridization condition applied for all sequences on the chip 4 6 7 The frequently used fold change threshold values of 2 3 to define a significant change are often arbitrarily chosen and do not take into account the statistical significance of absolute signal intensity For example microarray data showing a 4 fold change derived from low signal intensities may have no statistical significance whereas a 1 4 fold change derived from strong signal intensities may be highly significant in terms of reflecting actual changes in mRNA concentration within a biological sample Thus focusing on fold changes alone is insufficient and confidence statements about differential expression must take into account absolute signal intensities 8 In this study we have adapted a statistical method that utilizes absolute signal intensities from a reference set of positive controls and negative non homologous control sequences to determine the absolute intensity range in each channel that may be used with a certain confidence level on a particular microarray to calculate expression ratios The method of analysis proposed in this paper was originally developed along with radar and detailed results go back to the area of signal processing ROC curves have been used for many years in numerous other areas including psychology 14 15 and other areas of medical diagnostics 16 For this purpose diagnostic accuracy ROC curves have been used to depict the pattern of sensitivities and specificities observed when the performance of a diagnostic test is evaluated at several different thresholds Here receiver operating characteristic curves describe the ability of a particular parameter e g fluorescence intensity to discriminate between two conditions e g specific and non specific hybridization We illustrate our approach using gene expression data from a study comparing expression profiles of highly invasive and poorly invasive human melanoma cell lines 17 The goal of these experiments is to identify candidate genes that may regulate the invasive behavior of melanoma cells The area under the ROC curve may be used to assess the quality of individual microarray hybridizations which is particularly important because the quality of microarray hybridization can vary significantly 9 12 The statistical evaluation of a reference set of genes to measure the sensitivity and specificity of each microarray hybridization reaction dramatically improves the ability to quality control the resulting data a key requirement for the use of microarrays in diagnostic applications Here we propose the design of a prototype diagnostic microarray with respect to control sequences and we show how a ROC analysis using percentile ranks of specific and non specific hybridization signals can be used to establish signal detection thresholds and hybridization quality assessments for each individual microarray experiment Results The reliability of ratios measured to describe changes in gene expression depends on the absolute signal intensities While ratios from highly abundant transcripts may be accurate rare transcripts give absolute intensities that may be obscured by non specific hybridization Thus both ratio and absolute signal intensity are important to evaluate differential gene expression properly Calibrating the appropriate signal and noise intensity thresholds for a given microarray hybridization requires the analysis of a set of positive and negative reference genes At low signal intensities both reference groups yield overlapping signal distributions Figure 1aand 1b Test signals from array 1 and 2 falling within the overlap region cannot easily be categorized as either present or absent and calculating ratios may lead to the identification of false positives or false negatives Figure 1cand 1d Traditionally cut offs for microarrays have been calculated from negative controls Here we compare three widely used thresholds T X mean T 0 5X median T X2SD mean 2 standard deviations to the ROC analyses derived threshold T M the threshold with maximum specificity and senitivity T M obtained as the point of intersection in figure 2 in terms of specificity Sp and sensitivity Se Table 1 For T X and T 0 5X the Se is 100 however the Sp would only be 50 indicating that approximately every second signal would be a false positive arising from non specific hybridization As a benefit however 99 of test genes would be included in data analyses Table 1 If T X2SD or T M is the desired threshold the Sp can be increased to 95 with only minor reductions in Se however the trade off is an increase in the number of genes excluded from analyses Table 1 If Sp and Se are plotted as a function of the thresholds the intersection point of the two curves indicates maximum Sp and Se which can be directly read from the graph Figure 2 As the criterion for a positive test becomes more stringent the point on the curve corresponding to Sp and Se point c Figure 3a point d Figure 3b moves down and to the left lower Se higher Sp if less evidence is required for a positive test the point on the curve corresponding to Sp and Se point a Figure 3aand 3b moves up and to the right lower Sp higher Se The area under the ROC curve Figure 3 Table 2 is a measure of how well positive and negative signal can be distinguished in individual microarray experiments and indicates hybridization quality The discriminatory power of a threshold based on the receiver operating characteristics depends on the proper controls included in the study and this choice will affect the interpretation of the data Unlike spots containing printed control DNA plant bacterial or viral blank spots printed with 3X SSC often show strong signals indicating that unusually large amounts of label are inexplicably deposited on these manifestly blank areas The morphology of SSC spots giving relatively high signals are quite distinct from spots where DNA has been deposited often showing small highly concentrated areas of fluorescence The cause of this fluorescence is not well understood Their signal distribution is skewed towards large signals as compared to plant bacterial and viral genes data not shown Consequently the inclusion of SSC spots results in a considerable overlap with positive controls resulting in increased thresholds and a lower overall discriminatory power Table 2 To illustrate the importance of signal threshold detection we categorized differentially expressed genes of the melanoma study 17 according to confidence based on our predictive model Table 3 For this purpose we use T M as the threshold Group A contains gene expression ratios derived from signals that exceed the selected threshold in both channels and are assigned high confidence ratios In group B either Cy3 or Cy5 signals were below that threshold whereas in group C signals from both channels were below the defined detection limit Risky absolute intensities can be flagged and displayed when further processing the data e g clustering analysis Discussion Microarray data are generated from multi step biochemical reactions scanning data collection image analysis and data processing This process is inherently prone to variability that affects the specificity and sensitivity of the assay thus requiring evaluation of each microarray data set 9 10 12 In order to calibrate the sensitivity and specificity of the output data appropriate statistical tools applied to reference sequences composed of positive and negative controls may be used to quality control data from a given hybridization We argue that any procedure which uses raw intensity ratios alone to infer differential expression may be inefficient and thus may lead to excessive errors Since ratios are simply the result of uneven signal distributions between Cy5 and Cy3 channels analyzing these distributions will help interpret the biological relevance of an observed ratio Signals are the result of specific and non specific binding when a complex probe DNA mixture is incubated on the slide surface containing target DNA The quality of DNA microarray data rests on the ability to measure non specific components of a spot signal and eliminate them from ratio analysis Such a component analysis on spotted DNA microarrays is not possible with today s technology and the proportion of non specific binding will vary for each spot because of competitive binding in the presence of sequence specific hybridization Note GeneChip arrays from Affymetrix using perfect vs mismatch oligonucleotide pairs do to a certain extent measure the non specific binding component of every sequence see technical note discussing probe length and performance http www affymetrix com support technical technotes 25mer_technote pdf Since the influence of non specific binding is more severe for probes where no or little specific hybridization occurs 8 we treat the problem as one of detecting a threshold value that is both determined by the highest signals attributable to spots representing non specific hybridization and the lowest signals from spots where sequence specific hybridization must be assumed Simply put we determine a threshold separating specific from non specific hybridization assuming that the former usually results in stronger signals than the latter 18 A similar approach has been reported for Affymetrix GeneChip arrays so called LUT based scoring system 8 tables to check noise level of particular chips or noise filtering look up tables Methods used to determine a signal threshold include the use of arbitrary fluorescence intensities 19 relative errors in Cy3 Cy5 ratios 9 20 21 or certain signal to background ratios 22 However these methods lack information about the specificity and sensitivity of the threshold which are crucial parameters for estimation of the diagnostic accuracy of microarray hybridizations To select a threshold we have exploited a reference set of positive and negative control genes based on presence or absence of their cognate labeled cDNAs in the hybridization mix Positive controls may be spiked RNAs from non homologous species or transcripts known to be expressed in the sample i e housekeepers 13 23 Signals from positive controls should cover the range of test signals This can be achieved by appropriate spiking and or selection of housekeeping genes that fulfill this criterion The negative controls should be chosen to lack sequence homology to test genes however choosing appropriate control sequences for a ROC plot analysis is crucial we conclude that SSC spots show a distinct signal pattern different from plant bacterial and viral DNA deposits Unlike spots containing control DNA blank spots are not representative of non specific hybridization to cellular probe DNA do not behave well as control spots and should be disregarded for threshold detection on custom arrays The robustness of ROC analysis to yield T M and ROC area values to discriminate good from poor microarray hybridizations relies on the relative positions of signal ranges from positive and negative controls as well as from target genes We can imagine two szenarios making ROC analysis inappropriate for determination of threshold and or microarray hybridization quality i If the set of positive controls is in the high signal range ROC analysis will yield a higher T M and ROC areas close to 1 0 indicating good microarray hybridization because positive and negative signals are well separated irrespective of the distance between the greatest observation in the negative and the lowest observation in the positive sample Consequently a large portion of target genes will be discarded because of the relatively high T M ii Alternatively if the positive controls are spiked below the detection limit of microarrays i e typically 1 500 000 wt wt their signal range may resemble the one from negative controls This scenario will produce a low T M and ROC areas close to 0 5 falsley indicating poor hybridization The overall performance of individual microarray hybridizations can be assessed by the position of the receiver operating characteristic line Figure 3 using one single parameter the area under the ROC curve Table 2 Poor microarray hybridizations have lines close to the rising diagonal or values 0 5 whereas the lines for perfect hybridizations would rise steeply and pass closely to the top left hand corner or values 1 0 where both the specificity and sensitivity are 100 In high throughput applications such as routine diagnostic examinations where a large number of hybridizations may be performed using a standard microarray design the ROC plot area may be used as a hybridization quality checkpoint to either accept or discard individual microarray hybridizations for example 0 990 for array 1 and 2 Table 2 The area under the ROC curve represents a summary statistic of the overall performance of individual microarray hybridizations A modification of the Wilcoxon rank sum procedure may then be used as a statistical test to determine whether two ROC curves are significantly different 15 Among 25 thresholds calculated here we have compared Sp and Se of 3 commonly used cut offs with the ROC analysis derived threshold T M Table 1 The median or mean of a negative control group is regarded an adequate measure for non specific hybridization 13 however due to low specificity 50 we conclude that neither thresholds should be used if maximum specificity is required In such a case we find that the widely used cut off value defined as the mean plus two standard deviations of the negative reference sample may be used adequately for DNA microarrays The underlying rationale of using this threshold is to establish a cut off value providing a specificity of 97 5 24 25 In our own example Figure 1 skewness to the left makes the T X2SD overly conservative which will sacrifice sensitivity unnecessarily Hence T X2SD may be inadequate and to adjust the sensitivity one should use T M Most importantly the T X2SD procedure does not account for the sensitivity of the threshold Although the ROC analysis derived cut off resembles closely the cut off defined as the mean 2 SD it is entirely possible that choosing a finer grained partition of the signal space would alter the relative positions of theses two points Likewise this may be a characteristic for the 2 exemplary microarrays Usually the cut off selection procedure is an informed decision based on the motivation of the individual to accept false positives high Sp or false negatives high Se that takes into account whether it is crucial to exclude any false positives high Sp or to cover the broadest signal range possible high Se Which cutoff to use depends on the objective of the experiment If one needs to make sure that the present or absent call for a particular gene is correct a cut off with high Sp should be chosen whereas if one is willing to accept false positives where signals are low high Se will be the driving force The signal intensity is the most critical parameter that influences the informative value of ratio estimates 26 Therefore ratios should be judged based on the absolute signal intensity of each gene To diagnose the metastatic potential of highly versus poorly invasive melanoma cells we compared their gene expression profile with our metastasis chip which contains genes critical for aspects of the metastatic process including tumor cell motility and the ability to form primitive tubular networks 17 27 Each ratio was tested for the Null hypothesis that there is no difference between the means of the ranks of the Cy5 and Cy3 signals over 6 replicate spots representing a unique sequence At signal intensities below the threshold with maximum specificity and sensitivity some genes gave a ratio greater than 1 6 fold at a confidence level of p 0 05 In such a case however ratios are not optimal estimators because the low denominator value introduces large artifacts 8 Therefore we sought to determine ratio confidence categories based on the absolute signal intensities 13 Assuming that the ROC analysis derived threshold is an appropriate cut off for distinguishing absent present genes the proposed confidence categories may be interpreted as follows A The gene is present in both samples and this is the best estimate of the true ratio while further statistical evaluation should be applied to take into account the variability of the measurements B The gene is present in one sample and absent in the other Ratios are meaningless but this is still an extremely significant biological result C The gene is absent in both samples Not only are the ratios meaningless but so are the intensity estimates As a result of threshold setting certain genes may be falsely included false positives or less frequently 5 falsely discarded false negatives from further analysis i e ratio calculations clustering analysis etc as exemplified here with the microarray experiment for investigating invasion in cancer The ROC derived threshold correctly classifies the signal for Laminin 5 2 as absent whereas the mean or median derived thresholds would produce a false positive result Since this gene product plays a significant role in vasculogenic mimicry 17 Classifying the expression level is biologically crucial ROC analysis leads to a result Type B above that is in line with data obtained otherwise whereas both mean or median derived threshold would have resulted in accepting falsely a change type A above in Laminin 5 2 expression Collectively the present study demonstrated that microarray derived signals from positive and negative controls may be used to compute accurately type I and type II errors for a series of signal thresholds We have introduced a new model for signal threshold determination for gene expression microarray experiments that greatly eases the interpretation and comparison of these data This model is based on analysis of signal intensities and distributions of a reference set of positive and negative controls included on each microarray It provides a framework for determination of detection limits confidence about fluorescent ratios and for pre processing data for subsequent data analyses such as cluster analyses 23 28 Materials Methods Synthesis of PCR products IMAGE cDNA clones representing 72 human genes involved in cell migration were purchased
