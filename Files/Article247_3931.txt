 Losing My Cookies I have never knowingly clicked on an online ad Never I did it a couple of times accidentally about three years ago when I was still confused about how search engines worked and couldn t figure out which juicy inviting button near the top of the screen to hit But each time as soon as I realized I was going to a sponsor s page I recoiled as if a spider had landed in my hair No No No No I shrieked in horror jerking my modem s cord out of the wall Also I delete all the cookies on my hard drive once a week because I have some vague belief that this diversionary tactic will confuse the marketers and advertisers the next time I go to a site Also I always lie on any surveys Either I say our annual household income is less than 10 000 or I say it is more than 200 000 I never wanted to admit any of this to you but now that you are no longer directly involved in running any Internet sites I think you can take the truth This is not an anti Internet stance per se I just hate having people pester me to buy stuff I don t need My own brain is already working overtime pestering me to do same For that reason I have never willingly watched a commercial on TV either with the exception of that e trading commercial that you love so much and wake me up to see every time it comes on This is the funny part you shriek elbowing me I am proud to say that although the ad s plot line is vivid in my mind young upstart with vaguely threatening hairstyle shows that old geezer boss a thing or two I could not for the life of me tell you exactly which e trading company is paying the bill Am I the only person whose brain simply will not hold onto brand names I know what I like I just don t know if it s a Nike or an Adidas or some other model of car I like the ones with the shiny chrome fenders and bench seats But I don t think you can buy them anymore Here are the attributes of consumer goods that appeal to me far more than brand name 1 Color 2 Weight 3 Whether it feels comfy enough to fall asleep in while you re reading None of these features can be properly conveyed online Trust me I spend my days shopping on the Internet
