another benefit includes permitting real estate advisers to pension plans to continue to register with the SEC which will allow the advisers to comply with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA Also new advisers would not have to register initially with a state or states then deregister and register with the SEC if they had the expectation of being eligible

connection with the proposed rule which was summarized in the notice of proposed rulemaking 61 Fed Reg 68480 68491 92 December 27 1996 and was available to the public in its entirety One comment was received in response to the IRFA The preamble to the final rule contains a summary of the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis a complete copy of which was submitted to our Office and was available to the public The analysis describes the reason for the final rule and the legal basis for it descriptions and estimates of the number of small entities affected by the rule a discussion of the recordkeeping reporting and other compliance requirements and the steps taken to minimize the burdens on small entities The SEC estimated that of the 23 350 investment advisers currently registered with the SEC 17 650 advisers would be considered small entities After July 8 1997 GAO OGC 97 46 approximately 850 of those small entities would remain eligible for registration with the SEC The comment received in response to the IRFA concerned the impact of the proposed rule on small entities that manage funds regulated under ERISA ERISA protects a plan s named fiduciary from liability for the individual decisions of an investment manager appointed by the fiduciary to manage the plan s assets Investment manager is defined by ERISA to include investment advisers registered under the Advisers Act Although ERISA has been amended to include stateregistered investment advisers as investment managers the amendment expires 2 years after enactment When this amendment expires small advisers effectively will not be able to manage ERISA funds While the SEC found that it would be inconsistent with the Coordination Act to grant an exemption for the above described small entities the Commissioner has written to the congressional committees concerned urging that the sunset provision be eliminated and the ERISA exemption be made permanent Also in response to concerns expressed the final rule increases the threshold for Commission registration from 25 to 30 million of assets under management iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of
