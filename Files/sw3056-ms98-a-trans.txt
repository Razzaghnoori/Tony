        hi Ed   hi   hi   uh books uh ive actually i am reading a couple of different books uh uh one was uh is uh a story well it is not a story it is a collection of um of memos supposedly written by Howard Hughes uh that was uh   oh   that was  it came out a couple of years ago and i have just now gotten around to reading it i have had it a couple years but uh just just   who wrote that   oh i do not remember the mans name he was used to be a reporter for uh i think the New York Time or the Washington Post one of the two and he supposedly got this this  story uh i mean this uh was contacted by this guy who had these these memos he wanted to sell and they were they were ones that had supposedly been stolen from the um corporate headquarters in um in Los Angeles um   huh   they on i think it was Romain Drive or Romain Street or something there in Los Angeles they used to have a or i guess they still do uh had a uh uh big warehouse kind of thing which had offices and it was sort of nondescript for a you know for the size of the company which inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected he he was uh a great collector of everything he he he didnt he didnt throw anything away and uh supposedly this guy had had been breaking there for awhile he was a like you know burglar had been breaking there awhile and uh and had ended up   i see   he he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect and they uh they broke in one one night and found a bunch of memos that were uh supposedly from from Hughes to uh to his main um main assistant assistant assistant assistant back uh in the fifties and sixties well i guess in the sixties up until his death   well that is interesting all right   so its pretty interesting work so     that is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that   yeah its a its a little its a little hard its a its a you have to plod through it and you know it doesnt doesnt have a real story or any plot you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on     and they havent made a movie of the week of it yet   no i have not seen it but its but it is it is real interesting   yeah   uh i also reading uh the uh  its a an old another old book that i happen to have i am sort of rereading it its um a book about uh the Bermuda Triangle but its uh its about its a real good book that a guy um wrote who was uh a research librarian he wrote um sort of debunking many of the uh uh um the stories about the uh Bermuda Triangle you know he he was saying many many of the   uh   the myths many of the myths of the triangle were uh actually could be explained and and you know   explained like   uh and the reason reason i was i hadnt picked it back up was in light of all the uh the  well when they found the uh the airplanes out in the Atlantic thinking they were Flight Nineteen and i dont know if you are familiar with that at all but its uh Flight Nineteen was one of the uh a collection of a flight of five Navy adventures at the end of World War Two Right after World War Two and they were they were lost and uh so   supposedly scooped up by the triangle yeah   yeah they were and so and in the book you know even  he wrote this book back in the seventies and even and even then he he made had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water and uh because he he he mentions he he goes through and and brings out points from the Navys findings and so forth and uh its probably you know real close to what you know everyone is thinking now that they just got turned around and couldnt find their way back   yeah on that same topic have you ever read anything about you know the Amelia Earhart story whatever happened with her   uh no i havent   i i think that would be i am sure there is something out there uh that might a   yeah i would i would like to too because its a lot of things coming up here lately about her you know possibilities of her of where she have might have been   i thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years well whatever this is one aspect of it of course you know it is so weird cause no one will ever really know its it the   uh yeah   so but its entertaining and it makes you think about things that is for sure   right yeah so that is pretty much for right now that is what i have been reading i i kind of like to read different stuff and uh i like to read a novel every now and then but um i am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time   yeah right well i i guess i just have not read anything i mean usually i just if i find a good book i will sit you know for two days until it is finished if its that good and i think the last one i read like that was Scott Thurows   yeah   and that was Presumed Innocent   yes   and i just really really liked the way he writes its just   yeah i read that too i got it um right after it came out my uh   incredible yeah   you know he was an an assistant district attorney in Chicago at uh and while he was writing the book and uh my sisterinlaw lives in Chicago and she had before it actually got big she sent me this book saying you might like this this guy is you know from here and   uh   uh i i read it and really liked it and then about that is when it really got big and uh so i   that was good i think and and the other book i am trying to think you know like was in the last year and i think i did read Tom Wolfe and uh Vanity you know Bon yeah   i havent read that although i have heard it is pretty good   and yeah i that was really really good the movie was nothing compared to the book and yeah   yeah that is what i have heard i saw the movie and   oh the movie was a joke  compared to i mean because Tom Wolfe is so perceptive when it comes to you know pinpointing um   yeah   societys societys societys societys ills and things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things and   right right   and uh it was it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie   i know   and anyway we are not talking about that but um gee i just i like to read gardening books and things like that just to tell me what to do with my garden and and uh   yeah i have a lot of  computer books because i am i do computer work and so i have a lot of those so i spend a lot of time looking through those not necessarily reading them but uh looking through them so i   yeah   interested in a lot of that but uh i have got a lot of books that i i intend to read but i have not been able to yet you know for one reason or another   like what is a book on your list you know i have a list too and  i have never gotten to it   oh gosh i dont i dont really have a list because i just kind of uh i just have all the books out you know i have book shelves and i have them all out and usually when i am through with one i will go in and uh uh look look through uh i have one now and i i cant remember the name of it that i that i got is the sisterinlaw in Chicago usually sends me for my birthday or or Christmas or something will send me another another good book and   oh   uh shit i have one and i can not remember the name of it uh it is supposed to be a mystery
