 Over the last hundred years there have been major triumphs in medicine related to public health vaccination and the introduction of new medicines However over the same period several diseases have increased in prevalence and or severity In some cases the causes of the increase have become obvious the increases in lung cancer coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes for example are not considered to be a mystery On the other hand a large group of diseases related broadly to inflammation have also increased For these a wide range of hypotheses about causation have been proposed Type 1 diabetes rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease have increased since 1980 1 Some analyses of the increase in hay fever and asthma would suggest a similar time course and this parallelism of the time frame has been taken to suggest that there could be a common cause Indeed there is a proposal that these diseases are all related to some changes in cleanliness or hygiene that have resulted in decreased activation of a common control mechanism Specifically this control has been ascribed to T regulator cells which produce interleukin 10 IL 10 or transforming growth factor beta Change in Living Conditions The major changes in rural areas tropical villages or in Europe pre 1900 that could be related to the change in immune responses include decreases in helminth infection physical proximity to farm animals 2 exposure to those mycobacteria that are commonly found in the soil bifidobacteria colonization of the gut as well as decreased prevalence of Hepatitis A infection 3 The implication in each case is that asthma has increased secondary to an increase in inflammation or an increase of the allergic response that is closely associated This assumes that hay fever asthma and other diseases have increased in parallel which is probably not true Hay fever became a problem in Northern Germany and England as early as 1900 Clear evidence for this view comes from Noon s description of the development of immunotherapy for hay fever in 1911 the studies on hay fever prevalence by Ratner and Silverman in New York in 1935 and the recognition that hay fever was a major community problem in New York in 1946 More recently Harold Nelson analyzed all the studies on hay fever published in the United States and found a prevalence of 15 in 1960 with no convincing evidence of an increase since then H Nelson personal communication If seasonal hay fever was epidemic in 1960 then the subsequent increase in asthma has to be seen in a different light The best estimates for the start of the asthma epidemic are around 1960 for such diverse populations as army recruits in Finland 4 school children in Birmingham in the United Kingdom and African American children in Charleston South Carolina United States 5 In each of these studies the increase in asthma symptoms or disease has been greater than tenfold However the absolute values of the change have been dramatically different in New Zealand and Scotland from 2 up to 20 compared with Finland from 0 2 to 4 6 Furthermore some countries have experienced much greater increases in hospitalization than others Clear evidence for increases in mortality has only come from the United Kingdom New Zealand and the United States countries with a high prevalence of symptoms and hospitalization Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the increase in asthma Box 1 At this point our questions about the increase in asthma are 1 Is an increase in allergy or hay fever a necessary precursor for the increase in asthma a parallel event or separate 2 Why did the increase in asthma have such a consistent time course throughout the Western world in countries where changes in infectious diseases have occurred very differently and 3 Why is asthma more common and more severe in some countries than in other countries that have had an equal scale of increase i e tenfold over the same time course The Persistent Association between Specific IgE Total IgE and Asthma Long before the first case control or prospective study the association between allergy and asthma was obvious in case series These earlier studies reported skin testing with an amorphous extract called house dust but it was not until the identification of dust mites that the association was clarified 7 Indeed as late as 1978 there were significant doubts that allergens played a role in asthma Using extracts of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus dust mites the strong association between this allergen and asthma was established in many parts of the world with odds ratios as high as 6 or even 10 7 8 The possibility of a causal relationship was further supported by bronchial challenge studies and avoidance experiments 9 The cohort in Poole Dorset was until recently the only study with household measurements of allergen and the results strongly suggested that exposure in the child s own house was the primary determinant of sensitization 8 Subsequently studies from other parts of the world provided evidence about other indoor allergens particularly cats dogs and the German cockroach 10 11 These studies showed that perennial exposure to allergens was an important cause of inflammation in the lungs and associated nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity Figure 1 In most of the case control and prospective studies sensitization to seasonal pollens has not been significantly associated with asthma 7 This is an important issue if allergy is associated with asthma for genetic reasons or because of some common immunological feature it is not clear why the association should be with perennial allergens only Since assays for total serum IgE became available in the 1970s it has been clear that patients with asthma have on average higher total IgE than patients with hay fever or no allergy Indeed by 1980 this was considered an established fact in textbooks of immunology It was assumed that the increased total IgE related to allergen specific responses However in some studies the association between total IgE and asthma was stronger than the association between asthma and specific IgE In 1989 Burrows et al went further and suggested that specific IgE correlated with hay fever while total IgE correlated with asthma 12 The implication was that IgE has a complex relationship with asthma that is not dependent on specific allergens The strength of the association between asthma and total IgE raises questions that have not been resolved Do specific IgE antibody responses contribute to or even push total IgE If so do the IgE antibody responses to some allergens have more effect than others This question is relevant both to attempts to explain major differences in total IgE between countries and to studies on acute asthma In emergency room and hospital studies the geometric mean total serum IgE of patients with asthma is often greater than 200 IU ml higher than values found in population based studies Recent work from Heymann et al and Green et al on patients hospitalized for asthma has suggested that the interaction between rhinovirus and allergy occurs predominantly among patients with total IgE 200 IU ml 13 Thus the different properties of allergens could influence both the prevalence and severity of asthma However the properties of the dominant allergens do not explain the overall increase in prevalence which has occurred in countries with very different houses climates and traditions of domestic pet ownership The Paradoxical Relationship between Cat Ownership and Sensitization Significance for Prevalence or Severity Antigen exposure is considered to be a primary requisite for immune responses and allergen specific responses are no exception There are many examples of allergens that are not significant in areas where the allergen is not encountered For example the pollen of olive trees is not relevant in northern countries dust mite allergens are not significant in the northern part of Scandinavia or the mountain states of the United States and cockroach allergens are not significant in suburban areas of the United States the United Kingdom or New Zealand For dust mites there is a wide range of evidence that increased exposure increases sensitization Homes in Sweden Berlin the United Kingdom and New Zealand have progressively higher concentrations of mite allergen and progressively higher prevalence of sensitization to mite allergens 7 But there is now evidence that increasing exposure to cats does not lead to a higher prevalence of allergy 14 15 16 On a population basis the effect may be profound sensitization to cats among school age children is generally 10 while mite sensitization is often as high as 30 Figure 2 This effect cannot be ascribed to inadequate exposure since all estimates of the quantity of cat allergen inhaled are higher than for dust mites Furthermore the quantity of cat allergen found in schools or even in houses without cats is sufficient to sensitize at risk children 11 In fact children raised in a house with a cat were less likely to be sensitized to cats 15 Initially it seemed possible that the effect was an example of reverse causation However the effect has been observed in countries where a large proportion of families keep cats and very few families report choosing not to own a cat because of asthma in the family Furthermore the presence of a cat in a house in New Zealand does not decrease IgE antibody response to dust mites in other words tolerance to cats can be cat specific 17 Understanding how the response to cat allergen is controlled could provide an insight into how both the prevalence and the titre of IgE antibody responses in general are or should be controlled It seems inevitable that the primary control is by T cells specific for cat allergens Indeed there is already excellent evidence that injection of peptides derived from the cat allergen Fel d 1 which give T cell responses can be used for immunotherapy 18 Studying overlapping peptides of Fel d 1 we identified a striking response to two peptides at the terminal end of Chain 2 Furthermore both allergic and tolerant individuals respond to these peptides by producing IL 10 and interferon gamma 19 The implication is that Fel d 1 inherently induces control and that this control influences both allergic and non allergic responses to cat allergen Figure 3 In keeping with this IgE antibody responses to cat allergen are not quantitatively as high as those to dust mites 17 One of the central assumptions of the cleanliness hypothesis is that regulation of immune responses is at least in part non specific It is assumed that helminth infection mycobacteria Hepatitis A endotoxin and early life infections can create a milieu that leads to a decrease in allergic responses in general Likewise we might expect that exposure to high concentrations of cat allergen which can induce IL 10 producing cells should have a general effect There is some evidence for this hypothesis In Detroit the presence of two or more animals in the house tended to reduce allergy in general In Sweden the presence of a cat in the house is associated with decreased sensitization to cat and also to birch and dog However in the United States and New Zealand the presence of a cat in the home has no effect on the prevalence or titre of IgE antibody to dust mites 15 17 Thus it is clear that under some circumstances the tolerance to cats can occur in highly atopic individuals and be cat specific This phenomenon is not in keeping with any version of the cleanliness hypothesis It has been proposed that animals in the home could have a non specific effect because they shed or encourage endotoxin However recent studies on airborne endotoxin found that the presence of cats had no effect and that there were significantly lower endotoxin levels in houses with cats compared to dogs The Possible Role of Lifestyle Changes Over the last half of the 20th century there have been major changes in diet and physical activity The most obvious result of these changes is an increase in obesity which has reached epidemic proportions in the United States Since 1994 there have been multiple reports of an association between elevated body mass index BMI and asthma 20 In 1996 we suggested that changes in physical activity could be related to bronchospasm 21 Thus there are three distinct but strongly interrelated aspects of lifestyle that could be relevant to the prevalence and severity of asthma diet physical activity and obesity It is much easier to document BMI than diet or physical activity and although some of the obesity data are convincing they are not consistent and certainly not comparable to the association between obesity and diseases such as type 2 diabetes in childhood In a typical study Camargo et al found that the prevalence of wheezing was 13 among the heaviest quintile and 7 among the lowest quintile for BMI 22 Comparable values for type 2 diabetes would be 5 and 0 1 Studies using questionnaires have attempted to ask whether there is a relationship between wheezing and physical activity However the track record for questionnaires on this subject is very poor Westerterp and his colleagues have reported two observations first that general activity contributes more to energy consumption than aerobic exercise does and second that many subjects who initiate an exercise program such as a twice weekly visit to the gym overcompensate so that they actually decrease overall activity 23 Recently we have documented a decrease in activity among children age 4 years in the United States Head Start program a child development program that aims to increase the school readiness of young children in low income families who have a history of wheezing 24 Although there are several possible explanations for this result it seems clear that decreased activity can be present before elevated BMI The next question to ask is whether physical activity would have a beneficial effect on asthma Fredburg concluded that full expansion of the lungs had a more potent effect on bronchial smooth muscle than isoprenaline 25 Togias and his colleagues have shown that prolonged shallow breathing 20 minutes can lead to increased non specific bronchial reactivity 26 It is obvious that expansion of the lungs is decreased during prolonged periods of sitting down However periodic expansion of the lungs occurs with sighs Recent data from our group shows that sigh rates while seated are very variable but are significantly lower when watching a video than while reading 27 Thus there is a real possibility that some forms of childhood behavior TV videos computer games etc might be associated with sigh rates low enough to increase non specific bronchial hyperreactivity A different explanation for the effects of physical activity comes from evidence that physical activity can be anti inflammatory This evidence relates to several different models though not at present to the lungs In some studies obesity appears to be a risk factor for wheezing among non allergic children However in most studies the association between allergen sensitization and asthma has been found in obese and non obese children equally 28 Obviously some obese individuals are unfit and become breathless on exercise In addition these individuals may have sleep disordered breathing Thus there are other conditions that are easily confused with exercise induced asthma or nocturnal asthma Taken together there are excellent reasons for asking whether lifestyle changes have contributed to the increased prevalence or severity of asthma However it seems unlikely that this effect occurs on normal lungs so the hypothesis has to be that decreased physical activity in patients who are allergic can allow persistent or increased severity of wheezing Conclusions Although the explanation for the increase in asthma is not yet clear it is possible to put forward a model that includes elements of each of the three main hypotheses Children raised in the tropics on farms or in villages such as those in Africa or Papua New Guinea have exposure to endotoxin or infections sufficient to interfere with the development of allergen specific IgE antibody responses Once water supplies are clean and major infectious diseases have been controlled allergic diseases will appear However asthma appears to be associated with perennial i e indoor exposure and may be more common or more severe in countries where mites or cockroaches are the major source of allergens Even with indoor allergen exposure wheezing may remain transient or mild provided prolonged outdoor play is normal It is the combination of the control of infectious diseases prolonged indoor exposure and a sedentary lifestyle that is the key to the asthma epidemic and in particular the key to the rise in severity Using this analysis the severity of asthma in North American cities becomes much easier to explain Children in New York Atlanta Philadelphia and Washington D C spend long hours indoors have high exposure to mite cockroach and or rodent allergens and have very low levels of physical activity In conclusion it appears that these combined factors are the key to the asthma epidemic and in particular the key to the rise in severity We clearly need to develop ways to increase prolonged physical activity both among patients with asthma and in the general population We also need to investigate whether prolonged moderate activity is beneficial in the treatment of asthma and or is anti inflammatory What is equally clear is that the current obsession of the medical profession with the pharmaceutical management of asthma as well as other lifestyle related diseases does not address the reasons why the disease has become so common and so severe
