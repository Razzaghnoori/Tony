                    Background        Microcosm and mesocosm studies are commonly used in        ecological studies of aquatic and terrestrial habitats              Microcosms and mesocosms are generally subsets of        communities and abiotic factors of particular ecosystems        with restricted exchange of matter and energy     These        containers are by definition smaller than the organisms        actual habitat and controversy exists about the relevance        of these studies because of the scaling of simulated        habitats and the lack of replication and complexity               There is often an implicit and untested assumption        that scaling doesnt affect experimental outcomes in        microcosm studies            Aquatic insects such as mosquitoes are often studied in        micro and mesocosms in fact much of what we know about        mosquitoes has come from microcosm and laboratory studies        eg  These types of studies may be more relevant        for those mosquitoes that breed in phytotelmata ie        plantheld waters or artificial containers as these        experimental units may hold as much volume as many natural        treeholes pitcher plants or other containers             However there may still be fundamental ecological effects        of changing habitat size for aquatic insects living in a        variety of habitats such as phytotelmata and ponds        One species of mosquito that breeds in natural and        artificial habitats of various sizes is         Culex pipiens L more commonly known        as the house mosquito      This culicid has a more        or less global distribution and is found in North America        Africa Europe Asia and Australia Although         C pipiens primarily utilizes birds        as bloodmeal hosts      it inhabits humanmade        containers and is a known pest of humans                    Culex pipiens females oviposit and        larvae survive in a wide array of aquatic habitats        including gutters birdbaths pools rain barrels        treeholes and stagnant pools of water      In many        of these aquatic habitats leaf litter forms the basis of        the food web Microbes grow on the leaf litter and other        detritus and mosquitoes such as         C pipiens browse substrate or filter        water for microbes and detritus     Because the size        of         C pipiens habitat varies and        because there is often an implicit assumption in        experimental designs that microcosm scale does not affect        experimental outcomes     it is a logical species to        test for scale effects        Varying habitat size affects species and communities        living in small aquatic habitats and many of these species        appear to be flexible in their choice of habitat               However we need to be able to distinguish between        fundamental effects of scale that is how habitats of        different size affect growth and survival of individual         C pipiens and artifacts caused by        scaling which may be determined as much by experimental        design as by actual differences in habitat scale            Vertical or wall surface area is thought to be the source        of artifacts in micro and mesocosm experiments that are        scaled down from actual habitat size and artificially        enclose the system in question     Wall area is an        artifact because as microcosms are scaled down wall area        per unit volume increases which may affect composition of        the microbial community and increase dominance of        periphyton     Determining the source of effects is        critical for understanding the ecology of scaling and for        how microcosm design affects experimental outcomes If        scaling of habitat affects         C pipiens which inhabits aquatic        systems of varying size it might likely affect many other        organisms that either live in small aquatic habitats or        have been tested in smallscale microcosms        Resource quantity in the form of leaf litter also        varies in these habitats and we sought to test for an        interaction between the effects of food abundance on        mosquitoes which are well known     and the effects        of habitat size This would give us a better understanding        of how scaling impacts the biology of the mosquitoes        especially as higher quantities of leaf litter increase        growth of bacteria some of which might grow over the        vertical surfaces of microcosms and consequently provide        more food to mosquito larvae We hypothesized that there        would be detrimental effects of increasing depth and        decreasing horizontal surface area on survival and growth        of         C pipiens Specifically microcosms        with a lower horizontal surface area to depth ratio will        have an adverse effect on developing mosquitoes because of        lowered exchange of gases which may increase growth of        anaerobic bacteria that produce methane or hydrogen sulfide        CJP unpublished data or allow accumulation of mosquito        wastes Hydrogen sulfide for instance is a known toxin to        animals     and affects growth of the eastern treehole        mosquito         Aedes triseriatus Paradise        unpublished data Microcosms with less vertical wall        surface area per unit volume than others will be        detrimental to mosquitoes as there will be less surface        area from which to browse for microbes Finally we        hypothesized that effects of leaf litter quantity could        interact with effects of container size as increased leaf        litter may compensate for lower wall area per unit volume        since microbes grow and mosquitoes browse on leaf litter            High food abundance appears to decrease stress and        compensate for detrimental abiotic factors              Our experimental design allowed us to test for both        vertical and horizontal surface area effects which may be        both natural effects of changing habitat size or artifacts        of experimental microcosm design                        Results        The interaction between food availability and container        size was significant for all response variables except        female biomass which was affected only by main effects        Table  Fig a Not surprisingly high leaf litter        quantity led to larger mass shorter larval development        time and higher survival Figs and a When the        interaction was present there was no effect of scale at        high food abundance but when food abundance was low        container size affected male and female development time        and mass of males Figs bcd There were significant        differences between B Base size  used in other        experiments     see Materials  Methods and Table         and CD Constant Depth microcosms for female biomass        and male and female time to maturity such that B        microcosms with more wall area per unit volume had        larger earlier emerging mosquitoes Figs a c and d        Table  This is evidence for experimental artifacts        caused by decreasing wall surface area per unit volume        However differences between CW Constant Width and CS        Constant Shape  Table  were not evident        Fundamental scale effects caused by increased volume        were also present but only for the main effect of scale on        female biomass Fig a B microcosms compared to CW        microcosms were never significantly different and CD vs        CS comparisons were only different for female biomass        where mosquitoes from CS the largest and deepest        containers were significantly larger In addition        mosquitoes reached maturity quicker and males were larger        in Blow litter microcosms than in CSlow litter microcosms        Figs bcd These latter comparisons include both        fundamental effects and wall area effects but also        indicate adverse effects on mosquitoes as container size        increases        The logistic regression analysis revealed that survival        was dependent on litter quantity horizontal surface area        and depth Fig  Table  More mosquitoes survived in        high leaf litter treatments than in low leaf litter        treatments Fig a Emergence was markedly lower than        survival in most low litter treatments while almost all        mosquitoes that survived also emerged from high litter        treatments Fig a This is partly an artifact caused by        experimental duration Microcosms with low horizontal        surface area B and CW had lower survival than those with        high horizontal surface area Fig c and deeper        microcosms CW and CS had lower survival than shallower        microcosms Fig b CD microcosms had higher survival        than B and CS and yet the latter produced larger females        than CD Figs aand a                    Discussion        Petersen et al    make a number of recommendations        about using artificial habitats to test ecological        questions among them the suggestion to perform        scalesensitive experiments that allow an independent        understanding of volume and wall effects In this        experiment we independently varied different dimensions of        small aquatic habitats to look at how microcosm design        choices may affect experimental outcomes and how natural        changes in habitat size and shape may affect aquatic insect        larvae in a potentially resourcelimited environment        Our two habitat size hypotheses predicted  an adverse        effect of a lower wall area per unit volume a possible        artifact of microcosm design compare B to CD and CW to CS         see Materials  Methods and Table  and  an        adverse effect of a lower horizontal surface area to depth        ratio compare B to CW and CD to CS which may be a factor        in experimental design or in choice of oviposition site by        females We found more support for the former hypothesis        than the latter but regardless we found that container        size interacted with resources such that         C pipiens is affected by habitat        size only when resources are scarce Mosquitoes in the CW        microcosms with the smallest surface area and the greatest        depth had the lowest survival Both small horizontal        surface area and large depth decrease matter exchange        between the container and the surrounding environment and        increase waste accumulation from microbes and mosquitoes            Small horizontal surface area and small volume may        also increase direct interactions among individual        mosquitoes thus increasing interference competition        However mosquitoes from CW microcosms were not        significantly different from other mosquitoes in size or        time to maturity Differences did appear in comparisons of        B to CD microcosms indicating possible wall effects Our        prediction was that B microcosms with more wall area per        unit volume would allow for greater growth and shorter        development time of mosquitoes which it did at low        resource levels possibly by providing more substrate on        which periphyton could grow     In addition at low        litter abundance there is less leaf surface area and the        effects of varying wall surface area will be greater under        conditions of limiting resources Shorter development time        is important in ephemeral aquatic habitats such as        temporary ponds and phytotelmata allowing adults to escape        prior to dry down in late spring or early summer             Short time to maturity allows the insects to escape their        larval habitat before it dries up and males that mature        before females are ready to mate when females emerge        To test horizontal surface area effects we can compare        CD to CS and B to CW Table  Females from CS microcosms        were larger than females from CD microcosms regardless of        resource levels Both have the same wall area per unit        volume but CD microcosms had more horizontal surface area        per unit volume than CS microcosms and we predicted that        CD microcosms would yield larger and faster growing larvae        The extremely large volume in CS containers may have        supported high densities of microbes in the water column        and prevented leaf litter from packing together thus        allowing more surface area for microbial growth and less        interference among mosquitoes browsing for food than in        smaller volume containers where leaves were more tightly        packed We observed more tightly packed leaf litter in        smaller containers with high leaf litter quantities but we        did not measure microbial growth so this idea remains to        be tested Although wall area per unit volume was        equivalent in those two treatments the high volume of CS        indirectly produced more wall surface area The other        comparison between B and CW microcosms yielded mosquitoes        that were similar in size and development rate However        mosquitoes in B microcosms had higher survival than in CW        which had a lower horizontal surface area to depth ratio        than B in accordance with our second hypothesis        A final comparison of B to CS microcosms Table  is of        interest because it represents a comparison of constant        scaling which encapsulates both horizontal and vertical        scaling effects     Here the major effect is in time to        maturity and male biomass with the smaller volume        container producing larger males with shorter development        times Fig  The large CS microcosms had both less        horizontal and vertical surface area per unit volume but a        larger horizontal surface area to depth ratio Even though        B microcosms had a lower horizontal surface area to depth        ratio the actual depth was only  cm and positive effects        of more wall area and more horizontal surface area per unit        volume may have outweighed adverse effects of depth        The interaction we found between habitat size and food        abundance is consequential for ecology of the organisms        within and there may be a complex relationship between        habitat size habitat drying which changes volume when it        occurs and resources      For instance leaf        litter resources are often limiting to organisms in aquatic        detritusbased communities         Resources        in the form of leaf litter are consumed by microbes which        are then consumed by mosquito larvae along with small        particulate organic matter     When litter abundance        is high microbial growth is also high CJ Paradise        personal observation due to both high levels of resources        and substrate for microbes to grow on This may lead to        increased detritivore growth and decreased stress due to        deficiencies in abiotic factors as evidenced by the        mosquitoes in high leaf litter treatments being unaffected        by habitat size and shape Higher growth by larvae leads to        larger size and larger female mosquitoes have higher        fecundity and both males and females have higher adult        survival              Growth and survival may thus be affected by habitat        size which varies greatly among small aquatic habitats               There is a positive relationship between        size or volume of the habitat and species richness and        between volume and growth responses of individual species                 Levels of water and resources may be        important cues to ovipositing females with resulting        impacts on individuals and communities               Oviposition site selection is an important variable        affecting survival and development of nondispersing        larvae and large volumes may be preferred by females        laying eggs in aquatic environments due to increased        stability and decreased risk of drought             However allochthonous plant material from surrounding        terrestrial areas is the major input of energy resources to        many freshwater detritusbased food webs and resource        quantity in these habitats is highly heterogeneous and        dependent on location of the habitat relative to resource        inputs      Clearly the choice of habitat by        ovipositing         C pipiens females will have growth        and survival consequences for offspring                    Conclusions        Choice of scale in experimental design is important        even when studying mosquitoes adapted to a wide variety of        habitats The scale effect is likely to be caused by a        combination of horizontal surface area wall area and        depth When food resources are low high horizontal and        vertical surface area per unit volume allow for greater        growth than in conditions of low horizontal and vertical        surface area per unit volume Larval densities used in this        experiment were fairly low but competition for resources        may still have occurred when leaf litter quantities were        low The effects of container dimensions thus constrain        larval growth possibly by decreasing exchange of materials        or reducing inputs of resources an area of future        investigation Choice of container size either by        ovipositing females or researchers interacts with a major        aspect of the ecology of these organisms obtaining        resources in a potentially resourcelimited        environment                    Materials and Methods        The experimental design consisted of twentyfour        microcosms each of which fell into four different scale        types  a base size B which has been used in        microcosm studies of treehole mosquitoes                     constant width CW using the same size        container and doubling the depth  constant depth CD        using the same depth as the base but doubling the width        and  constant shape CS which doubles both the width        and depth of the base treatment Table         By comparing B to CD and CW to CS we can assess whether        there were experimental artifacts caused by decreasing wall        surface area per unit volume Both pairs have containers        with the same depth but the second container in each pair        has more total wall surface area and less wall area per        unit volume By comparing B to CW and CD to CS we could        test for fundamental scale effects caused by increased        volume Both pairs here have containers with the same width        and have the same wall area per unit volume However the        second container in each pair is deeper and has less        horizontal surface area per unit volume        Microcosms used for B and CW treatments were  liter        polyethylene containers Dimensions were  cm   cm at the        microcosm bottom widening to  cm   cm at the top        with a total depth of  cm Microcosms used for CD and        CS treatments were  liter polyethylene containers with        full width of  cm and a total depth of  cm These        containers were not completely square as the vertical        comers were rounded Actual dimensions are shown in Table         The overall habitat sizes are within the range of        natural habitats used by         C pipiens Netting  mm mesh        covered holes cut in the lids        Within each scale type half of the microcosms had high        leaf litter about  g  l of dried red oak          Quercus rubra L leaves and half        had low leaf litter approximately  g  I of dried red        oak leaves Table  with three replicates of each        treatment combination These resource levels have been        shown to affect growth of treehole mosquitoes and        colonization of artificial treeholes in the field               Leaves were collected in January  dried for        one week at C weighed to within  g of the desired        mass and added to the appropriate microcosms The drying        of leaves may mimic natural conditions as water in        container habitats is ephemeral with containers drying and        filling with precipitation inputs              After addition of leaf litter distilled water was added        to a line that marked the appropriate depth We allowed the        microcosms to incubate for one week while leaves were        wetted and microbes grew We then added first instar         C pipiens larvae obtained from        Carolina Biological Supply to each microcosm in such a way        that the density of each microcosm would be relatively        constant However because of the slight differences in        shape noted above the exact initial densities ranged from         to  larvae  I Table         The mosquito larvae were added on  February  and        by early March adults had begun to emerge from high leaf        litter treatments As the adults emerged each day they        were captured counted and sexed Adults were frozen and        later dried at C for  days for determination of        biomass The adults were collected daily until  March         at which point emergence was less than five adults        per day for one week and we ended the experiment At that        point the microcosms were searched for remaining larvae        and pupae which were counted for determination of total        survival to that day        Percentage survival length of larval period and total        female biomass were calculated Statistical analysis        consisted of twoway analyses of variance ANOVA on the        mean male and female biomass and time to maturity from each        microcosm and logistic regression on proportion survival        For the ANOVAs we used the means because individual        mosquito responses were not independent and an ANOVA model        with microcosm nested within the fixed effects of leaf        litter and container size did not work because some        microcosms had no mosquito emergence The Tukey procedure        for comparisons of treatment means was used when tests were        significant for interactions at or below the  of          of ANOVAs performed       Time to        maturity was logtransformed to approximate normality and        reduce heteroscedasticity For logistic regression we        tested for relationships between survival and horizontal        surface area volume vertical surface area depth and        leaf litter quantity We did not test proportion emergence        because more adults might have emerged from low leaf litter        treatments had the experiment been run longer possibly        biasing those results
