            tell you what this is later   all right um well personally with me i think we ought to introduce it to the young people but i dont think you can force it upon them because if you force it upon them they i dont know i it wasnt forced upon me and i i with it beings more my idea it i tend to just stick with it a little bit longer   yeah id say ten years is a good while especially do is yours on a renewal basis is it do you have to renew each year or   no i i just i go through and i i work on like a monthly basis       i do you know like one weekend a month type thing   uh do you have a do you have a minimum requirement for your community service is there a commitment like a term commitment   no no um well what i do is i work uh i volunteer with the Red Cross and im a member of their disaster team   oh really   and so i pull call once a month to do disaster work such as single family fires and then for national jobs they call me when they need me   gosh that must of you must have seen a lot of exciting things and i think that would be good for youth because it would just be an experience that they it would be difficult to get under a lot of circumstances unless youre involved in some kind kind of group   right right if you find your niche um you know and and i worked with a lot of of groups that you know have been working to get young people more involved in what we do and um if you can if you can find help them to find their niche you know theyll theyll really grow to love it but if you force them in to something that theyre not real keen on theyll rebel on it and at least the ones ive seen you know and and they and they they struggle against it and they want out of it as fast as they can   yeah i could see that happening um i i would think with enough publicity theres got to be a wide enough variety of uh groups that they could volunteer with that they if they didnt find their niche in one group if if theyre if   umhum   groups were enough were publicized enough they could just know what they could know what their options were for other groups to try   right   and other services to contribute   right and something i dont know the Peace Corps signing up and going away  i mean ive got a real good support system with my family and such like that you know and and theyre the ones that you know i i i think family can make a really big difference in in sticking something out   oh absolutely   you know and so you know as long as you dont pull them away from their family to to to take them off somewhere to do something you know youve got a better chance of making it work   yeah i think the Peace Corps would be uh scary for a lot of people because of that isolation  even if they were in teams it would be   umhum   a little more conducive i think to a to a fellowship feel in that could they could draw a support from   right   but i understand that a lot of them are uh well i certainly dont know any statistic but that a lot are are working individually and um i guess thatd be it it i would find i find it hard to imagine maintaining an incentive i or maybe not incentive but uh just keeping a focus on the goal   umhum umhum well id i i had never i didnt know that they were trying to push through a law or anything to make kids do this i that whenever they brought this up that kind of caught me off guard you know i think you know the way i got into mine was they did it it they started it in junior high school and it could just be like an extracurricular club that you could become involved in and you could do as little or as much and you decided how much involvement that you got which you know a lot of people dropped out but we have a lot we have a large number of people that were it was introduced to that way that has stayed with it and had grown with the organization does that make sense   yeah i think that does make sense um youd have to uh i think having having the individual whos volunteering set their own pace   umhum   for development in the program would would be key to just staying staying away from that feeling of being forced into it whether they were officially forced into it or just the pressure was so high to stay in or meet a you know minimum requirement of time commitment that uh   right   you know uh but then i think you almost reach a point where if if you pad everything too much it kind of takes away the experience i mean the experience of sacrificing i guess is what im thinking   umhum umhum   does making of going overboard overboard overboard almost   right well thats true um and and it one other thing youve got to really look at is uh depending on what age group youre going to involve you know be it high school or whatever youve got to have good adult mentors you know because otherwise you get into this situation of youre too young to do any of this   yeah
