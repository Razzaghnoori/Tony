cellular and broadband personal communications services and certain specialized mobile radio providers to permit unlimited resale of their services The First Report and Order also eliminates an exception to an existing rule which permitted cellular licensees under some circumstances to restrict resale by their licensed cellular competitors It also provides that the resale rule will sunset 5 years after the last group of licenses for currently allotted personal communications services spectrum is awarded expected to occur within a year GAO OGC 96 32 According to the Commission the purpose of the above actions is to make the mass market for two way switched voice mobile services more competitive while that market is in a transitional state as well as to encourage new entrants into the market by allowing them to resell their competitors services while they build out their networks Enclosed is our assessment of the Federal Communications Commission s compliance with the procedural
