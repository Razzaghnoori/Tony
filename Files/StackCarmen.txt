 OK My name s Carmen Stack and I m just going to tell a little bit about myself Um I was born in Charlotte NC and I moved to Monroe um which is about forty five minutes east of Charlotte um when I was about three And I ve grown up there pretty much all my life I moved back to Charlotte to go to college and stayed there for four years and am still there But um OK but I live with my parents right now I moved back in after I graduated college and I have a sister she lives there too She s in high school Her name is Ivy and she s going to turn seventeen in a couple weeks And my grandmother lives next door and my grandfather works across the street from where we live so we re all really close and pretty tight and um I m real I m closer with my grandmother um which is my mom s mother and um we do a lot of stuff together go shopping and go to lunch and stuff everyday So um but anyway I guess I can tell a story about when I was little I OK I um I have a lot of cats and I have a lot of dogs and so I love animals a lot And um when I was probably about eight years old my mom and I um well we had two dogs one was a Russian Wolfhound and one was just a little mutt dog But um we left them there by themselves with uh well like a bowl of food out which usually we don t do but we were going to go get some lunch and um we were gone for probably about twenty minutes And we came back and Mongoose was the little one and Tanya was the bigger dog uh but when we came back we saw that Mongoose uh was bleeding from her eyes Tanya had ripped her eye out had bitten her eyeball out um obviously over the food that we had left out on the floor And so obviously I was totally devastated and my mom was too and so we rushed her to the vet and um they everything was OK Like they were able to save her but they couldn t put her eye back in so they just kind of sewed it up and eventually it grew hair back over it And uh she just had one eye with hair covering the other side So it was pretty it was funny but she lived for another six years at least So but she was a good dog And but she did fine after that with just one eye but um let s see I guess Do you have any memories about many trips you used to take when you were little Like to the beach or something Um yeah well um we my aunt Bebe had a beach house Well they always had like a condo that they had rented or they owned a couple um when I was little And this was on my mom s side and we would always it would be like my aunts and my cousins and my grandmother My my grandfather died before I was born Uh he died when my mom was probably about eighteen so I never got to see or meet him But um all of us and my mom and my sister and my dad and everybody would go to the beach and um What was it Myrtle Beach Yeah we d go to Myrtle Beach And um we would stay for probably about a week and we just had we all had the best time We all the cousins were just really close like we all were probably about the same age except for my sister she was she s seven years younger than me so and everybody else is older than me I have a cousin that s um 31 now and Tara is Rachel s 31 Tara s 28 Michael s 24 I m 23 and my sister is 17 So but anyway um we all we all got along really good and it was just it was like one of the better times that we all had that we all spent together for the year And when it was time to go to the beach together it was just like it was like great We couldn t ever replace it So but uh I guess that s the What would you do when you were at the beach What was your favorite place Well we would all well our favorite place I mean we were pretty young so our favorite place was like the Pavilion or going to walk on the strip or something But um we you know during the day it was always the beach going to the beach and playing on the beach and laying out and then going shopping at the um like Broadway at the Beach or um Barefoot Landing And we d usually shop during the day and then at night we d sit well food is like the main thing for our family We center everything around eating dinner so or eating a dinner breakfast dinner or lunch So but um at night we d always go to dinner and um to the Pavilion or else to go to the Grand Prix or is that what it s called And um stuff like that Like the adults would always take us places and let us go and ride rides and stuff like that and we d all go together as a big group and it was just a lot of fun We were all really close and we still are But um Was it your your grandmother does she she sort of you said she kind of heads up the whole thing Oh yeah Sort of the matriarch Yeah she definitely is She s like she heads everything like Is she from Charlotte Yeah well yeah She s from Charlotte She was born and raised in Charlotte And uh so you know she had all her she had three children And um my grandfather was he s from Charlotte too and all his family And um but yeah my grandmother she s like the head of everything She makes sure that we re all together for Thanksgiving and Christmas and Labor Day and New Year s Day and everything She just always wants everything to be at her house and kind of be centered around her So after she s gone I don t really know what we re going to do It ll be kind of hard for us But ah she s 74 and she s still going strong but actually yesterday she had a small stroke but she s she s OK She s better today She s been in the hospital but um she they re just kind of giving her some physical therapy and stuff right now just to kind of make sure she ll do OK But she s strong She ll make it through You said uh you were telling me she s uh got some funny sayings that she says and stuff She s got some funny like when You tell it Oh wait I m trying I think I can t remember Um like It s not worth something something Oh um yeah but my grandmother she yeah she s got some funny sayings Like she ll well she when she s referring to my cousin Michael he s kind of like he s kind of the I guess the black sheep of the family You know just he s my cousin and he s a year older than me but he can t he can t keep a job and he s just got a He fails a lot at pretty much everything he does But she always says that he s not worth the powder to take to blow his ass away So But um you know it s pretty funny of course he doesn t he doesn t think it it s funny but she that s her favorite thing to say But she she ll about anything to anybody and it s kind of embarrassing sometimes Straight shooter But yeah she s just she s straight on with you She ll tell you like it is and if you don t like it then that s just too bad But we ve come to realize that s her and that s just the way it s going to have to be But um um so my next story I guess I want to talk about uh I guess I ll move on to kind of high school era Um we were it was I guess there were probably about maybe seven or eight of us but I was the only girl I hung out with a lot of my guy friends We were always out kind of doing boy stuff and I guess I wasn t really like a tomboy but I did like to go fishing and hang out with the guys and stuff But anyway um we were riding um there were probably about eight of us and we were riding in the back of the truck And I I was in the back And uh you know I just kind of it was Andy s truck and he was driving And um we were going to Lake Twitty and I kind of just got volunteered into going with everybody So we were going cat fishing but and the guys had some beer And um so anyway we were just riding along and we pulled into uh and oh Something that I left out Daniel had a light that he had would like a big flashlight that he was shining and um not a flashlight a spotlight and it had a blue light in it and he was kind of flashing it around and just playing around with it And um we pulled into the road that takes us to the lake and all of a sudden we a car followed us uh followed in behind us and it was like a 300ZX And um we pulled in and we stopped and he got out and but just he was just kind of we couldn t see him because he had he had his lights on his brights And um he said Why don t you why don t you point that thing over here to see what I got And uh he had he had a gun And well come to find out he was a police officer but he was off duty and he was in an unmarked car And uh Monroe Monroe police Yeah Monroe police And uh so he had pulled us over because we were flashing the light And um so you know Daniel said that you know he was sorry He didn t realize that we were causing any trouble But um he had told us that um So he says to us that um he shows us his gun and he said that he had he almost shot us And he acted really nervous and jittery and he acted like he came up to the car kind of close and he acted like he did want to shoot us And um he but he didn t really care that we had that we had um beer and he didn t mind that we were all under age or he didn t even know because none of us were of age And so you know he didn t act like he really wanted to fill any papers on us or anything It was kind of you know it was just like it was really scary We didn t really know really know what to expect from him We didn t know that he was a cop We didn t find this out till probably about 10 or 15 minutes later until he was about to leave But um he just was really nervous acting He he was definitely scaring me because he acted like he wanted something to happen He was really mad at us for doing that But yet he wasn t calling any backup or anything like that And he was alone and he just seemed kind of scary But we found out probably about a year later or we saw on the news that was a year later he had been arrested for um murdering a girl um in in Monroe And he pulled her over and murdered and found out or got arrested for murder And uh now he s in NC State penitentiary So I guess we were lucky that night But
