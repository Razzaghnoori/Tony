 Center could help you defend yourself in court By Russell Lissau Daily Herald Staff Writer Posted on June 27 2002 Representing yourself in court can be a tricky endeavor There are confusing legal terms to learn strict procedures to follow and volumes of case law that often need to be understood to prepare a case Lake County officials and a private agency that assists indigent litigants in Illinois want to make the practice easier by creating a self help center for people who choose to represent themselves in legal matters The center which will be housed in the law library at the main courthouse in Waukegan could open later this summer I think it s going to be extremely helpful Court Administrator Bob Zastany said There is a population out there that will take advantage of this resource The self help center will be the only one of its kind in the county Only a few operate nationwide officials said The project is the work of Lake County circuit court officials and Prairie State Legal Services a statewide agency with an office in Waukegan that provides information and legal assistance to poor and elderly Illinois residents The organization has received a 25 000 grant from the Illinois Equal Justice Foundation a nonprofit group that funds programs designed to increase access to legal information and assistance to help pay for the effort Prairie State will share the money with the county The county s law library is on the first floor of the governmental center at 18 N County St The new self help center will be designed to help litigants find the information they need to properly represent themselves in court an undertaking that can be complicated and confusing Some people can do OK on their own and some people can do OK with some help said Linda Rothnagel the managing attorney for Prairie State Legal Services But other people can t do it It s not always easy Self representation is a right affirmed by the U S Supreme Court The practice is far more common in civil matters than in criminal cases In fact self represented litigants formally called pro se in Latin or for oneself in criminal defenses are so rare that statistics about the practice generally are not kept legal experts say Among the civil cases most likely to feature pro se litigants are divorce personal injury and eviction disputes People represent themselves in court for a variety of reasons with one of the biggest being financial concerns According to a 1991 survey by the American Bar Association people who make less than 50 000 a year are more likely to represent themselves than wealthier litigants However about 20 percent of self represented litigants say they can afford an attorney but do not want one the survey said Many how to books are available on the subject of self representation and the Internet is loaded with resources about pro se litigation Lake County s self help center will help pro se litigants locate those resources and apply them to their cases proponents said The space which Zastany hopes to open by Sept 1 will feature computers that will give patrons access to case histories legal glossaries and other information through the Internet and CD ROMs It also will have paper documents that often are used in court proceedings as well as a special telephone line that will help people who speak languages other than English get the information they need A county employee will be on hand to assist litigants with their research as well Zastany said the center will demystify the judicial process for many people We re bringing these services directly to the people who need it he said
