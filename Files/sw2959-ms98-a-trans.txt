          are you a Vietnam veteran Dudley   uh no   no do you have family who were in the Vietnam War   uh no my father was uh came in right after world war two   okay so he was too old and youre too young right yeah all right do you know some folks who have been there   i am too young yeah um yes a couple   okay okay how did it influence them   uh the the one guy i worked with down in Austin hated it uh he was a lineman down there and while he was there he caught some kind of a strange disease   umhum umhum   and uh all his hair fell out and he had like a hundred and five fever for a while and   umhum uh what about long lasting effects on him has he still suffering from those problems   i do not think he was in combat so   umhum well ive talked with a number of Vietnam veterans and i really i had no one directly related to me involved   umhum   but uh my sisters husband was in Vietnam and it it really made a completely different man out of him he went to Vietnam one man and came back another not better   umhum yeah   then uh another friend of mine went and he was in combat but he came back and he said okay thats it that is behind me i am going on with my life much like what Roger Staubach did   right   he was uh he was a Vietnam war veteran and uh   yeah but he was in the Navy though he was it makes a lot of difference   yeah thats true right and but uh most of the folks that i have met that were actually on the land or in combat are still still carry a lot of anger   umhum   they really do and uh i i i i really do not think that we did those young men right i think that uh Desert Storm shows a lot of learning since that time     oh yeah      uh   well the armed forces did so much to you know Agent Orange they did so much to their own people all during that time you know and they take they take a even now uh they take a free hand as far as medicine and   yeah thats true yeah   uh you know how they treat the war casualties you know if you come back and your legs blown off you know or or it is hanging by a thread they still cant put it back together now but   umhum umhum uhhuh   but what they do afterwards and how they rehabilitate rehabilitate you   well you know one of the most troublesome things that i have encountered as a result is the incredible influx of southeast Asians into this country since that conflict uh not so much that i say i do not want you here but there is just such a surge   umhum yeah   of southeast Asians it has affected the culture of this country uh very much   oh yeah its about its about nine or ten percent now   yeah yeah yeah well uh the cultures changing look how much more oriental food we have restaurants now for example   umhum   uh even ten years ago there werent that many a lot of shops are are operated by uh southeast Asians   umhum   a lot of people have complained in the schools there is a culture change there the southeast Asians seem to be very hungry there seem to be very studious and uh tends to cause our kids to really have to buckle down to keep up with them which is not bad not really uh but it might in the long run you can see where   yeah   scholarships for example uh even jobs   umhum   uh jobs that would normally go to an American with a lesser education might be going to to some of these people here and that is all a result of of of Vietnam and and you see a lot of a lot of men that were over there brought families back   yeah thats   uh and it concerns me that there is probably a lot of mixed breed youngsters still there and id be concerned or interested to find out how they are doing now   umhum well they are probably not doing very well at all because i know theres theres still people even in the Dallas area there are there are still people trying to get some member of their family back from uh Vietnam   i know that theyre you are talking about POWs or missing in actions   um uh native native Vietnamese people   native Vietnamese people okay   yeah they were lost you know when they were little and and they could never did get back   oh i hadnt that that hadnt occurred to me   yeah   thatd be an interesting concept   and uh and uh thats is really a big waste because they didnt they didnt win they didnt regain any of the land that they had it spilled over into uh now i cant even think of the country but   Cambodia   yeah Cambodia  and to Laos and   umhum umhum   and all they did is run and hide and they werent really fighting you know it it wouldve been the same as Desert Storm if all they had been fighting was North Vietnam   umhum umhum   but and i am not even sure who was involved more whether it was China or Russia you know they were pouring they were pouring weapons in there and   umhum   and advising well digging tunnels for them you know and there is no way that they could ever catch them   umhum well i think the terrain had a lot to do with the the success of Desert Storm as opposed to that in Vietnam   yeah that is right   you know there is incredible cover in Vietnam and you cant find much cover on  in a sand dune   umhum yeah yeah and all they can do is dig in and they you know and then they try to camouflage the top   thats right umhum umhum   well now even i think even now in in Vietnam they could probably have done a better job because they could  they could kill all those plants you know which would devastate the country as far as farming from then on but and the and the Corps of Engineers i think do a better job now like they did in Desert Storm   well   because they had he he dug a bunch of moats and filled them with oil and he set a lot of booby traps all along the way as they went and they had to you know they had to blow them up or   umhum umhum   or disarm them and then they had to fill in little bridges all the way where he where hed made those moats   umhum what war do you think they found the experience for that   uh   dont you think they learned from the mistakes in Vietnam   well yeah partially uhhuh yeah part of it is technology yeah because all go ahead   part of its that part of its technology but but when when when you get into trouble like that in a place like Vietnam you do tend to analyze the problems that you get into and you sa y never more and and you overcome those problems and you are prepared next time   yeah i think thats one of the reasons that theyve theyve pretty much avoided getting involved in South America because   umhum   look what happened when they were looking for Noriega and they lost him for four hours when they were right on top of him you know he probably just went down into a tunnel   right umhum sure sure sure well i know that  from a personal standpoint people was one of the finest assets that we lost we didnt actually physically lose them they did not lose their lives but they lost a whole lot of the life they might have had   yeah that is right   uh being entirely different people i had dinner Monday night with a Vietnam veteran who is just now beginning to recover from the drug and alcohol struggle that he had   umhum   thats a long time to suffer   yeah and they they really need everybody thats thats stood there its when in in Vietnam i think it was much closer contact you stand there with a rifle and blow a a piece of somebody apart   umhum   or blow their head off and that has to affect you if you are human you know so they had to work all that that anger out and the and the nightmares that come along with it   umhum oh yeah yeah i cant uh oh yeah you bet you bet   i dont i do not really think that anybody can ever forget forget that but they can they can reason and and try to adjust to to why they were there   umhum yeah well you see thats what the veterans are so angry about now they say well were going to listen to this and were going to look at this find out what our mistakes were and were not gonna make them again but that doesnt undo the ones that were done and thats what makes the veterans angry   right   and i cant blame them i dont know a solution   umhum   but i sure cant blame them for being angry on the other hand you know you can be angry about something for a very long time or you can say well that is the way it is and go on with your life   right   uh for the most part i wish that it hadnt happened but it did so   yeah and that and that was that was in the in the era when Kennedy was president that they were afraid of everything you know and and and they fought initially got into it because of Eisenhower   thats right   and he just he didnt want to be in it any more than than what we started out in August with Desert Storm and then it just blew up into the war   oh yeah well it has been that way for a very very long time though i can remember when i was in the sixth grade and that was many years ago we were reading about the French struggling with that in southeast Asia   French yeah umhum      so and and and the Asians historically have always had these kinds of wars going on there there has not been a lot of peace in that part of the world   right umhum   i really i dont know it we should not have maybe gotten involved but if we did we certainly should have supported our people who were there more so supported them when they got home   yeah right   and uh i am afraid that they were treated as castaways for the most part   exactly   and i i saw the movie Born On The Fourth Of July and i think it did a good job depicting the temperament of the times   umhum yeah more than was apocalypse now   umhum well Dudley have we pretty well discussed the subject well i think so i enjoyed talking to you uhhuh byebye   yeah i think so yes it was nice talking to you okay byebye
