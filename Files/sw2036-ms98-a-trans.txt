 so what do you think uh do you know any people from Puerto Rico uh yes i i used to work with a guy from Puerto Rico when i worked for Hewlett Packard oh really and uh he was a native and had gone to school there and got transferred to Colorado where i was living uh huh uh and he had some interesting times getting used to it um the United States the the language was a little bit different although he did speak English yeah have you ever been there it was just some of the excuse me have you ever been there i ve never been there my dad used to work for DuPont and they built a chemical plant down there i almost moved there when i was in high school really yeah no i ve never been there either i ve not known but just a few people from there uh huh one uh there was a girl in in my flight in in uh Air Force basic training actually who was from there uh huh okay uh my dad flew down there for about a year he was down there about once a month one week per month uh huh and uh i wanted to move there it sounded like uh a neat place to live an island in the sun you know and uh oh yeah it turned out my mom was the only one in the family that didn t want to go because she didn t play golf or tennis and there wasn t really a job for her there it always sounds more oh its i think i think everything always sounds more glamorous than it really is yeah every because i spent five years in Europe and everybody goes oh you re so lucky and i m like well yeah sort of you know it s but having lived there it s not it s not anything like you picture it uh huh yeah right you know it s not it s like i still have the fantasies about Hawaii and all that stuff but yeah i lived in Colorado for a while and people kept saying the same thing to me oh it must have been great and your just like yeah well sort of right i go oh it was just a place to live yeah i was but um what do you think about about um their situation should they should they become a state i i think the status quo seems to be working i don t think um from talking to Jerry my friend that lived there that they don t seem um upset about it or anything and yeah i think it would upset more people if they tried to change it really i i think i m not opposed to it but when its when the time is right it will probably just kind of happen you know yeah i don t know fifty one stars on this flag wouldn t look too good where are they going to put the other one yeah if they got another state they could bring two in and fifty two might be able to uh be arranged better i don t know well where are we where are we going to get another state yeah i don t know cut California in half or something or Texas no that s not a good idea but um i know a lot of the major companies kind of like it because they ll build plants down there because they don t have to pay taxes on the stuff oh yeah um and they make i guess it s no income tax there or federal no federal income tax something like that oh yeah because it s just a territory or is that what it s called a territory yeah um yeah i think it s a territory okay that makes sense i mean there s uh lots of tiny islands in the South Pacific that are territories like that they could make states like Guam or uh is that a U S territory though yeah it s a U S territory and it s just we own it or that would be kind of bizarre yeah that s kind of far well Hawaii is pretty far too think about it well that s true but there is not a whole lot between here and there yeah where you you start dealing with Guam it s like you know flying over all these other places to get there yeah it s definitely a way out of the way where where as My dad was stationed in Guam during the World War Two though uh huh yeah where as Puerto Rico is pretty close by yeah which i don t know of course you could annex Cuba but they wouldn t like that a bit no i don t think they would i don t think they d go for that yeah but actually i knew another guy from Puerto Rico that i went to school with um hum and he was coming he came to America to to go to school and i think he was going to go back be an engineer out there oh yeah do you think he was really funny both of the ones i met have been really funny guys i don t know if that s uh if that s true about all Puerto Ricans or not ones i met have been pretty pretty funny no i have no idea but uh so you think that mostly they re they re pretty much satisfied with things the way they are yeah i don t i didn t hear any major complaints about it um i definitely think that we ought to let them decide and not say okay you re a state now or you re your own country or whatever yeah exactly but um let them decide really that s why i said you know when it when when their time is right when they re ready for it you know that it will come about yeah yeah i think that makes the most sense okay hum well Rick it s been good talking to you okay have we have we been on for a long enough time i think so i think its they want like five minutes or something don t they okay yeah this is this is actually the first time i ve i ve had someone call me so oh okay but uh it went fine okay bye bye all right well it was good talking to you Becky bye bye
