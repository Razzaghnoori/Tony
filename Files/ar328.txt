 Introduction The clinical observation that sexual dimorphism plays a role in the immune response suggests that the endocrine system is an important factor for the development and maintenance of the response There is a high frequency of autoimmune diseases in females and an increased immune response to antigenic stimulus These observations make it evident that sexual dimorphism probably acts on the immune response through its effect upon the thymic hypothalamic pituitary gonadic axis 1 Series of subjects with gonadal dysgenesis and isolated cases of Klinefelter s syndrome associated with rheumatic autoimmune diseases RAD suggest a relation between these clinical conditions 2 3 Among male patients reported to date who have hypogonadism and RAD are individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus SLE 4 5 6 7 lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid syndrome associated 8 scleroderma 9 10 11 12 rheumatoid arthritis RA 13 ankylosing spondylitis AS 14 15 16 and polymyositis 17 while Turner s syndrome has been associated with autoimmune thyroiditis 3 juvenile rheumatoid arthritis JRA 18 and juvenile onset inflammatory bowel disease 19 Only one of these reports included eunuchoid males and female subjects with an abnormal X karyotype 2 Our goal in the present work was to determine whether male patients with untreated hypogonadism have an increased risk of developing RAD and if so whether there is a relation to the type of hypogonadism Methods The clinical criteria of male hypogonadism refers to failure of testicular function resulting in decreased production or absence of male sex hormones and impaired spermatogenesis whether this failure is secondary to hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunction or is primary testicular failure 20 From 60 patients who fulfilled the previous hypogonadism criteria who were seen at the outpatient Andrology Clinic Mexico City Mexico from July 1998 to May 2000 13 who were not receiving hormone substitution were selected for this study The clinical criteria of male hypogonadism refers to failure of testicular function resulting in decreased production or absence of male sex hormones and impaired spermatogenesis whether this failure is secondary to hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunction or is primary testicular failure 20 Ten normogonadic healthy male hospital staff with similar age and body mass index 21 constituted the control group for testicular size and hormone levels All the patients gave their informed consent They and the control subjects were given a neuroendocrine genetic and clinic evaluation including a physical exam in addition to computed tomography of the sella turcica and karyotyping of peripheral leukocytes The presence of secondary sexual characteristics and testicular volume normal value 20 ml were noted In the patients the rheumatolgic evaluation included a search for the presence of diagnostic criteria for SLE RA AS psoriatic arthritis JRA polymyositis dermatomyositis scleroderma CREST

Kallmann s syndrome and two had idiopathic cryptorchidism Eight out of the 13 male hypogonadic patients also had RAD independently of the cause of their hypogonadism Of these four had B27 AS two had SLE in one case associated with anti phospholipid antibodies one had JRA and one had juvenile dermatomyositis Tables 1and 2 We did not find adult RA scleroderma scleroderma CREST psoriatic arthritis or Behcet s syndrome Among the patients age and body mass index were similar in those with and those without RAD Serum testosterone and estradiol 17 levels were lower in those with RAD but only the difference in testosterone was highly significant 1 0 0 7 vs 2 7 1 2 ng ml P 0 0005 see Supplementary Table 1 Discussion As far as we know this is the first report of an intentional search for RAD in male patients with untreated hypogonadism Usually males with hypogonadism diagnosed in infancy or in youth are those who have a complete hypogonadic clinical picture Some individuals however exhibit an incomplete clinical picture and may reach adulthood without having their condition diagnosed Their condition may come to light during tests of sterility in a couple or during epidemiological studies 23 24 25 26 which have established the frequency of male patients with hypogonadism At present it is considered that the frequency of male patients with hypogonadism in the general male population is somewhere between 0 04 and 1 23 24 and that the most frequent genetic alteration found in these persons is that causing Klinefelter s syndrome whose prevalence is of the order of 0 02 to 0 09 in healthy populations 23 24 25 26 and 0 2 to 41 3 in populations with certain mental or behavioral problems 27 28 29 Our study was performed in a smaller group of male patients with hypogonadism to those that have been reported previously for two reasons First the patients were studied in an andrology clinic for infertility and thus are not an unselected sample of the general population Second their hypogonadism had not been diagnosed or treated previously Although it is arguable that our series of patients not being a representative sample is unsuitable for evaluation of the frequency of RAD in patients with hypogonadism we investigated RAD only in those who had not been treated for their hypogonadism to avoid the possibility that androgen replacement had interfered with the development of RAD 30 31 Because the clinical picture of RAD in some of the patients was severe with clear systemic and articular symptoms their RAD had been diagnosed elsewhere However other patients with hypogonadism who also had JRA and AS had only a few articular symptoms so slight that the RAD had gone unnoticed until we looked for it Considering that the frequency of RAD in Mexico City where our study was performed is about 0 83 including RA 0 62 SLE 0 03 polymyositis dermatomyositis 0 04 JRA 0 03 AS 0 01 and other RAD Sjogren s syndrome mix connective tissue disease etc 0 1 32 the relatively large number of cases of RAD in this very small group of male patients with untreated hypogonadism was surprisingly high P 0 001 suggesting a strong relation between the two conditions see Supplementary Table 2 The development of RAD only in those patients with severe testicular dysfunction suggests that such dysfunction is one endogenous factor that predisposes to the development of RAD The disorder most frequent in our group was the combination of B27 with AS The frequency of patients with B27 all of whom also developed AS was very high 30 7 leading to the conclusion that the risk that males with hypogonadism will develop AS is higher than that of a healthy Mexican mestizo about 4 P 0 001 33 We cannot explain this association at present The frequency of SLE in male patients with hypogonadism was higher than would be expected in the general population Despite the increased odds ratio for the development of SLE in such patients the confidence interval was very wide suggesting that other factors in addition to hormonal and genetic alterations affect the development of SLE in these patients Our group of patients includes as far as we know the first case of hypogonadism associated with juvenile dermatomyositis The development of dermatomyositis and JRA was higher in our patients than in the general population P 0 006 and P 0 004 respectively Supplementary Table 2 Nevertheless the confidence interval was not calculable therefore we conclude that these associations are coincidental The fact that frequency of RA was no higher in our group of patients than in the general population suggests that the RA and hypogonadism are not related as has already been suggested 13 Because the group of patients we studied was so heterogeneous hypogonadism due to various causes and various RAD we can conclude only that the hypogonadism itself regardless of its particular etiology and the very low serum testosterone levels are associated with the increased frequency of RAD Studies in healthy normogonadic males with RAD have found low serum levels of testosterone and high levels of E 2 in patients with RA SLE and Sjogren s syndrome 34 35 The inflamed tissues of normogonadic patients with RAD contain intense cellular infiltrates rich in macrophages These cells have hormonal receptors capable of converting testosterone and androstenedione into estrone and E 2 by means of aromatase 36 37 38 An increase in the activity of aromatase induced locally could explain the drop in androgen levels and the increase in estrogens observed in patients with RA 38 However in our group of patients serum testosterone and E 2 were both decreased Therefore in our hypogonadic male patients the main cause of the testosterone decrease was not due to an increase in its conversion to E 2 because the gonadal failure caused a decrease of both hormones mainly of the testosterone without showing an increment from its conversion to E 2 Although the effects of low serum testosterone levels on the immune system have been little studied Bebo et al have shown that orchidectomy in mice can diminish the flow of CD4 activated in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis 39 In humans before treatment with androgens patients who have Klinefelter s syndrome but not RAD have very diminished levels of testosterone associated with high levels of IgG IgA IgM IL 2 and IL 4 and with an absolute increase of CD3 CD4 and the CD4 CD8 ratio 30 In patients who have both Klinefelter s syndrome and RAD the diminished level of testosterone is associated with low percentages of OKT3 and OKT8 and with an increase of the OKT4 OKT8 ratio 31 On the basis of our findings and of the reports cited we conclude that lack of testosterone increases humoral and cellular immunity When androgens are given these abnormalities are reversed and the clinical picture improves 30 31 If our argument is correct low serum testosterone levels favor the development of RAD in the hypogonadic male patient while in the normogonadic male who develops RAD mainly in RA the decrease of testosterone serum levels is due to an increase in its metabolism for the activated immune system with the subsequent elevation of E 2 These differences could also explain the low or almost null association of RA and hypogonadism 13 In both cases after androgens are given the clinical picture and the abnormalities of the immune system are ameliorated 30 31 38 In summary males who have hypogonadism regardless of its cause develop RAD more frequently than the general population when they have very low serum levels of testosterone Abbreviations AS ankylosing spondylitis B27 histocompatibility antigen B27 CREST calcinosis Raynaud s phenomenon esophageal
