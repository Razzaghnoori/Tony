 Background According to recent estimates from the American Heart Association the number of cardiovascular operations and procedures performed in the United States increased 384 from 1979 to 1998 1 Specifically the number of percutaneous coronary intervention PCI procedures rose 248 from 1987 to 1998 and although not as spectacular the growth rate for coronary artery bypass surgery CABS was also impressive with an estimated 553 000 cases performed in 1998 Whether these changes for PCI and CABS apply to similar procedures performed in the Department of Veterans Affairs VA is a relevant question as the VA provided health care services to over 3 million veterans in 1999 The comparison between the data sources for all U S cardiovascular operations and procedures and VA provision of these services is of interest because of the comparability of the VA health care system with national health care systems such as those in Canada and Europe The similarity of the VA health care system to these national systems including global budgeting regionalization of costly services and essentially free provision of care to a defined population creates an important contrast with the remainder of the US health care system Most of the U S health care system is driven by fee for service payment particularly by Medicare in the population receiving cardiovascular procedures The use of cardiac revascularization procedures defined as CABS or PCI represents a distinct philosophy and organizational imperatives concerning the treatment of coronary artery disease How these expensive procedures are used is an indication of how scarce health care dollars are allocated The first objective of this paper is to compare over time CABS or PCI use separately for the VA NHDS and NIS for example within the VA from 1991 through 1999 were there discernible trends in the use of CABS A second objective is to compare age adjusted use rates in the VA with estimates from the 2 national databases Methods VA Patient Treatment File The VA Patient Treatment File includes records of all hospitalizations occurring in all VA medical centers from 1970 to current it has several components which contain extensive demographic and service eligibility information and procedures performed in the operating room as well as those performed in other hospital locations including the cardiac catheterization laboratory 2 Procedures are indicated by International Classification of Diseases 9 thRevision Clinical Modification ICD 9 codes there is extensive coding of procedures with a maximum of 5 codes per surgery performed in the operating room and a similar maximum per each procedure performed outside the operating room with a maximum of 32 separate entries per hospital stay The database includes a record linkage number making it possible to link to other VA data files as well as to identify individuals with multiple hospitalizations For this study VA hospitalizations for the years 1991 through 1999 were used National Hospital Discharge Survey The National Hospital Discharge Survey is an annual sample of hospital discharges from nonfederal hospitals located in the 50 states and District of Columbia 3 The current study uses survey information for the years 1991 through 1999 approximately 2 million hospitalizations As in VA databases coding of procedures is with ICD 9 procedure codes although coding is not as extensive with a maximum of 4 procedures per hospitalization There is also limited demographic information including age gender race and geographic region of the hospital although the hospital itself is not identified Unlike the VA there is no record linkage number to permit identification of individuals who are hospitalized more than once Sampling weights are provided for calculating national estimates of the number of hospitalizations for specific cardiovascular procedures Nationwide Inpatient Sample The Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project is a 20 random sample of all hospital discharges from selected hospitals in participating states Hospitals and state organizations that agreed to release their discharge data for research purposes were randomly selected according to a sampling frame based on ownership control bed size teaching status urban or rural location and geographic region Since its inception in 1988 the number of hospitals sampled and number of states participating have increased from 11 in 1991 to 17 in 1993 and to 22 in 1997 when there were over 7 million discharges in 1000 hospitals 4 As in the other 2 data sources procedures are identified with ICD 9 procedures codes with a maximum of 15 codes per hospital stay The Nationwide Inpatient Sample does not include a record linkage number for identifying individuals who have been hospitalized more than once but it does identify the hospital and generally has more information than the National Hospital Discharge Survey It also provides case weights for generating national estimates of cardiovascular procedure use For purposes of this report hospital discharges for the years 1993 through 1997 were used with 1997 being the most current year for which discharges were available Study population For each data set hospital discharges with evidence of coronary revascularization procedures were selected by employing specific ICD 9 procedure codes CABS was defined as procedure code 36 1x discharges with concomitant procedures involving the valves or septa of the heart code 35 x were excluded so that only isolated procedures were selected PCI included hospital discharges with procedure codes 36 01 36 02 36 05 or 36 06 with the latter code indicating coronary artery stenting Since the code for stenting was implemented in October 1995 rates of stenting are reported for the years 1996 through 1999 In the VA where it was possible to detect for an individual patient multiple procedures of the same type performed on the same hospital day only the first procedure of that type for that day was counted Procedures occurring on other days of the same hospitalization were also included Since over 90 of VA users are men this study does not include women and given that use of these procedures is rare in children and young adults only individuals 20 years and older were included For purposes of comparison among the 3 data sources age race and geographic region of the hospital were also collected Race was categorized as white black other or unknown Geographic region was defined as Northeast Midwest South or West The Northeast region included hospitals located in the states of Connecticut Maine Massachusetts New Hampshire New Jersey New York Pennsylvania Rhode Island and Vermont The Midwest region had the states of Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Michigan Minnesota Missouri Nebraska North and South Dakota Ohio and Wisconsin The largest region in terms of number of states was the South Alabama Arkansas Delaware District of Columbia Florida Georgia Kentucky Louisiana Maryland Mississippi North and South Carolina Oklahoma Tennessee Texas Virginia and West Virginia Last the West region had the following states Alaska Arizona California Colorado Hawaii Idaho Montana Nevada New Mexico Oregon Utah Washington and Wyoming Denominator construction Denominators for calculating age specific rates for the National Hospital Discharge Survey and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample were obtained from the US census for the years 1991 through 1999 5 The numbers of men in age categories 20 34 35 49 50 64 65 74 and 75 were reported for each year For the VA the numbers of unique users of VA healthcare services were obtained from the Outpatient Care files The numbers of eligible male veterans who had at least one visit to a VA healthcare facility were reported for the years 1991 through 1999 using the same age categories as for the 2 national surveys Statistical methods It is important to recognize that 2 of the data sources in this study included samples of hospitals whereas the VA contained all hospitals and procedures For the National Hospital Discharge Survey and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample we obtained national estimates of the number of revascularization procedures by employing case weights Age specific rates of use for each procedure were determined by dividing the number of procedures by the number of men in the specific age category for that particular year Age specific use rates were standardized by the direct method to create age adjusted rates for each year the 1999 US male population 20 years and older was used as the standard Rates are expressed as the number of procedures per 100 000 population The Chi square for trend statistic was used to determine if there was a statistically significant increase or decrease in use rates within the VA and NHDS Results Baseline characteristics There were 58 807 isolated CABS performed in 43 VA medical centers from 1991 through 1999 distributions of age race and geographic location of the medical center are shown in table 1 For the National Hospital Discharge Survey there were 16 540 hospitalizations for isolated CABS and in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample there were 54 218 procedures done in 1997 These cases provided the basis for the national estimates presented in table 2 In general the mean ages of men undergoing CABS were similar in the 3 datasets although the VA had a lower proportion of individuals in the 75 years and older category However in the VA the proportion of users 75 years and older increased from 10 in 1991 to 20 in 1999 as seen in figure 1 In the United States as a whole the proportion of men 75 and older was relatively constant over the 9 years 5 6 in 1991 versus 6 6 in 1999 These men were predominantly white although the significant proportions of unknowns in the National Hospital Discharge Survey and Nationwide Inpatient Sample hindered comparisons across the 3 databases There were significant differences with respect to geographic location of the hospitals where these procedures were performed In the VA over 40 of hospitals were located in the South whereas in the National Hospital Discharge Survey and Nationwide Inpatient Sample the distributions were more balanced although the latter had a higher proportion of institutions located in the Northeast region Presumably these differences were due to sampling strategies employed in the 2 surveys of hospitals The results for PCI mirror those for CABS as seen in table 1 In the VA there were 51 509 hospitalizations performed in 51 medical centers Rather than combine all 5 years of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample we report baseline characteristics for 1997 the most recent year for which these data are available Noteworthy findings have to do with the lower proportion of veterans in the oldest age category and the predominance of VA medical centers in the South region Numbers of procedures and utilization rates In the VA from 1991 through 1999 there was a 35 6 decrease in utilization rates for CABS and a 1 3 decrease in the total number of procedures performed table 2 This decline was highly statistically significant p 0 0001 by Chi square for trend The trends for the 2 national samples were quite different In the National Hospital Discharge Survey there was a 6 8 increase in utilization rates as well as a 23 6 increase in the estimated number of procedures p 0 0001 In the Nationwide Inpatient Sample utilization rates from 1993 to 1997 increased 8 6 and the estimated number of procedures went up by 16 4 Utilization rates were lowest in the VA and were considerably higher in the 2 national samples It is also noteworthy that beginning in 1995 utilization rates for CABS declined in the VA and National Hospital Discharge Survey Overall PCI rates in the VA increased 18 3 from 1991 to 1999 and the number of procedures increased 75 6 during the same period table 3 This increase was highly statistically significant p 0 0001 As with CABS there was a decline in utilization rates starting in 1996 In comparison to the VA in the National Hospital Discharge Survey there were dramatic increases in utilization rates 66 9 and the rise in the number of procedures was also higher than in the VA 95 5 p 0 0001 In 1997 there was a decline in both rates and numbers of procedures but in 1998 this trend reversed with significant gains for both 1998 and 1999 In the Nationwide Inpatient Sample where there were only 5 years of data utilization rates increased 26 8 and the number of procedures went up 36 5 Significant gains in the use of stenting were evident in both the VA and National Hospital Discharge Survey As was the case with CABS PCI rates were lower in veterans than in the other 2 settings The findings for revascularization defined as CABS and or PCI mirror those for the individual procedures as seen in figure 2 Discussion The results of this study demonstrate considerable variability in the use of coronary artery revascularization procedures in VA and non VA hospitals In the VA not only were overall rates lower but also both the number of CABS performed and age adjusted rates declined from 1991 to 1999 whereas in the National Hospital Discharge Survey and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample both the estimated number of procedures and age adjusted rates increased during the time for which data were available The findings for men undergoing PCI were somewhat different in that in all 3 settings there were increases in both the number of procedures as well as the age adjusted rates However in the VA starting in 1996 there was a noticeable decline in the age adjusted rates of both PCI and CABS this decline was also evident in the National Hospital Discharge Survey for CABS Age adjusted rates of CABS and PCI were lower in the VA than in the other 2 settings but it is important to put these rates in perspective In 1993 in New York State the age adjusted rate of isolated CABS for all patients was 120 6 per 100 000 somewhat lower than the VA rate of 166 0 per 100 000 for men 5 By contrast the age adjusted rate for CABS in Ontario Canada was only 67 4 per 100 000 6 Presumably the rates for New York State and Canada would be higher if only men were included A similar pattern was apparent for PCI in New York State the age adjusted PCI rate for women and men was 127 8 per 100 000 very similar to the VA rate of 139 8 per 100 000 and higher than the Canadian rate of 57 2 per 100 000 6 The comparison of VA rates to those in New York State and the province of Ontario in Canada is relevant because of the similarity to the VA health care system in the key dimensions of global budgeting and regionalization of services Hospitals in New York State are heavily regulated compared to most of the rest of the United States They are capped in the amount of budget growth annually and provision of costly highly complex services such as CABS and PCI is limited Similar constraints are in place in the province of Ontario to an even greater degree than in New York State There are several explanations as to why age adjusted rates in the VA were lower than those reported in the 2 national surveys First not all veterans who are users of VA healthcare services undergo coronary revascularization procedures in VA hospitals 7 8 This may be particularly true for veterans who are eligible for Medicare and receive treatment for acute coronary syndromes in non VA hospitals that are closer to their residences and have cardiac catheterization and open heart surgery facilities For veterans undergoing elective procedures it may be that they lived far away from one of the 51 hospitals that performed CABS and or PCI and elected to undergo procedures closer to their homes In short veterans undergoing revascularization procedures in non VA centers were not included in the age adjusted rates reported in this paper and this in part could account for the lower rates The extent to which veterans of all ages undergo revascularization procedures outside the VA is not known It is also possible that older veterans were not candidates for the CABS or PCI due to excessive comorbidity there is evidence that older veterans may have poorer health than non veterans or veterans who are hospitalized in non VA facilities 9 10 Finally although there is no evidence to support this decision making for revascularization procedures may be more conservative in the VA An explanation for the decline in use rates may have to do with the rapidly aging veteran population The number of veteran users age 75 and older increased 177 from 210 000 in 1991 to 582 000 in 1999 whereas the US male population 75 years and older increased only 27 from 4 8 to 6 1 million Veteran users 75 years and older comprised almost 20 of the veteran population in 1999 yet in the US men 75 and over accounted for only 7 of the male population 20 years and older This higher proportion of older veteran users coupled with the fact that comparatively fewer older men underwent revascularization procedures in the VA may in part explain the decline in use rates in veterans The results of this study must be considered in the light of two limitations First it is important to recognize that the age adjusted rates from the 2 national surveys were estimates based on case weights 11 The 2 surveys produced somewhat different estimates of both the number of procedures performed and age adjusted rates because in part the surveys probably selected different hospitals While these surveys include hospitals representative of those in the United States they do not necessarily contain hospitals that are indicative of those performing cardiac revascularization procedures These differences may also be due to the fact that the Nationwide Inpatient Sample reported up to 15 procedure codes as opposed to only 4 in the National Hospital Discharge Survey The number of codes reported in the VA was much larger but this did not result in higher use rates for the VA Due to both sampling and coding issues the national surveys may incorrectly estimate the number of revascularization procedures Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample which identifies the hospital we estimated age adjusted rates for CABS and PCI in New York State for 1993 The age adjusted rate of CABS for both women and men in New York State was 198 per 100 000 which is higher than the 121 per 100 000 reported by Tu et al 6 who had counts of all surgeries performed in New York State On the other hand our counts of CABS were estimated by applying case weights to the hospitals in the survey The situation with respect to PCI was different the estimated age adjusted rate for New York in 1993 in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample was 142 per 100 000 similar to 128 per 100 000 reported by Tu et al 6 A second limitation of this study has to do with the choice of denominators For the 2 surveys the United States male population 20 years and older was used whereas in the VA the number of eligible veteran users was employed As has been seen the proportion of older individuals in the US census was relatively constant whereas in the VA the proportion of users 75 years and older doubled during the study period The VA denominators include users of health care whereas the denominators for the national survey include both users and non users Given potential over estimation of the number of procedures in the 2 national surveys possible under estimation of the number of procedures in the VA and differences in the types of denominators it is possible that age adjusted rates of procedure use were too high for the national surveys and too low for the VA Conclusions In summary national hospital discharge databases reported dramatic growth in the use of cardiac revascularization procedures although the use of CABS declined slightly with the advent of stenting which has reduced the need for emergent bypass surgery 12 In the VA since 1991 there has been a decline in both the total number and rate of CABS performed and since 1996 a decline in age adjusted rates of PCI These declines are most likely a function of several factors including increasing substitution of PCI for CABS and the aging of the veteran population as well as its
