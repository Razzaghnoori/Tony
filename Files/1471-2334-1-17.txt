 Background Due to the current unavailability of anti HIV vaccines other preventive methods have to be developed to control the ongoing AIDS pandemic This includes the design and application of safe and effective topical microbicides Screening of pharmaceutical excipients revealed that cellulose acetate phthalate CAP commonly used for enteric coating of tablets and capsules 1 has anti HIV 1 activity CAP in micronized form and formulated into a cream is a broad spectrum microbicide inactivating several sexually transmitted disease STD pathogens 2 3 4 including HIV 1 2 5 It was of interest to explore the mechanism s whereby CAP causes inactivation of HIV 1 Since CAP has a relatively high molecular weight M w 60 000 2 its effect on HIV 1 virions would be expected to be confined to the virus surface i e to the envelope glycoproteins gp120 and or gp41 Thus CAP would be expected to affect one or more steps required for HIV 1 entry into cells i e binding to cellular CD4 to the major HIV 1 coreceptors CXCR4 or CCR5 for X4 and R5 viruses 6 respectively and fusion with cell membranes 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Results presented here show that CAP pretreated HIV 1 has a reduced capacity to bind to the coreceptors leading to impaired virus infectivity Methods Reagents The following monoclonal antibodies mAbs the source is indicated in parentheses were used 2F5 and 588D Drs T Muster

of CAP treated and untreated HIV 1 IIIB undiluted to 1 512 in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 fetal bovine serum FBS were mixed with MT 2 cells 10 4cells well and placed into 96 well polystyrene plates The mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37 C and the volume was adjusted with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 FBS to 200 l On the 4 thand 6 thday after incubation at 37 C 100 l of culture supernatants were removed from each well and equal volumes of fresh medium were added On the 6 thday XTT dye 1 mg ml was added to the cells Intracellular formazan was determined spectrophotometrically 18 19 Similar experiments were done with HIV 1 BaL except that PM1 cells were used instead of MT 2 cells and virus production was measured by ELISA for p24 antigen one week after infection The percentage of

8 for 2 h at 20 C followed by either mAbs 1 g well or rabbit antisera diluted 1 100 in phosphate buffered saline PBS for 1 h at 20 C Subsequently the wells were washed and postcoated for 1 h at 20 C with bovine serum albumin BSA and gelatin 1 and 0 1 mg ml in 0 14 M NaCI 0 01 M Tris pH 7 0 TS Chicken serum 10 in PBS Ch PBS was used instead in experiments with HIV 1 BaL The wells were washed with TS and stored at 4 C HIV 1 virus particles suspended in PBS were added to the wells for 5 h at 4 C Subsequently the wells were washed 10 with ice cold PBS or 1 50 anti p24 mAb in Ch PBS for HIV 1 BaL and then treated with lysis buffer 1 Nonidet P40 NP40 100 g ml BSA in PBS for 30 min at 37 C The supernatants were removed and tested for p24 antigen using ELISA kits from Coulter Immunology and following the manufacturer s protocol In other experiments wells were coated with CAP 1 g ml in 25 mM sodium acetate pH 6 0 and postcoated as described above To detect binding of CD4 to CAP treated and control gp120 wells coated with graded amounts of gp120 and postcoated as described above were reacted with biotinylated sCD4 1 g well in PBS containing 100 g ml BSA for 18 h at 4 C washed with TS and the bound biotinylated CD4 was determined after adding HRP streptavidin 1 g ml in TS containing 0 25 gelatine and 0 05 Tween 20 for 30 min at 37 C The wells were washed and bound HRP was detected using the test kit from Kirkegaard and Perry and the absorbance read at 450 nm Flow cytometry To determine the binding of gp120 biotinylated CD4 complexes to HIV 1 coreceptor expressing cells CAP treated and untreated gp120 5 g and biotinylated CD4 2 5 g in PBS containing 100 g ml of BSA were mixed for 1 h at 20 C and then added to 10 6MT 2 cells in RPMI 1640 medium containing 100 g ml of BSA

Similar experiments were done with peripheral blood lymphocytes PBL isolated by the Isopaque Ficoll technique 20 Quantitation of CAP gp120 binding Forty g of gp120 were mixed with 40 g of CAP in 1 ml TS or 1 M NaCI 0 01 M Tris pH 7 0 and incubated at 20 C for 30 min The mixtures were transferred into a Centricon centrifugal ultrafiltration device with a M w cut off of 100 000 and centrifuged at 3 500 g for 30 min The filtrates were transferred to a similar device with a M w cut off of 50 000 and centrifuged under the same conditions CAP retained on top of the filter was quantitated as a complex with ruthenium red 21 The retentate on the 100 000 M w cut off filter was dissolved in 1 ml of 2 M guanidinium hydrochloride and CAP released from the CAP gp120 complex and retained on the 50 000 M w cut off filter was quantitated by the same method Molecular Modeling A cellulose chain consisting of one cellotetraose unit composed of four 1 4 linked D glucose units was created in Quanta 22 and 50 of the hydroxyl groups at positions 2 and 3 were modified to acetyl ester and 25 of the hydroxyl groups at position 6 were modified to phthaloyl ester 1 23 The acetylated and phthaloylated cellotetraose structure CTAP was minimized by the steepest descent method followed by the adopted basis Newton Raphson ABNR method The energy change of 0 05 Kcal mol between two successive structures was used as the termination criterion in both the steps The crystal structure of gp120 1gcl 13 was retrieved from the pdb http www rcsb org and the V3 loop created by homology modeling based on the nmr structure of the V3 loop from 1ce4 using the SWISS MODEL 24 automated comparative protein modeling server http www expasy ch SWISS MODEL html was attached to the gp120 crystal structure using Quanta s protein design module The docking simulation of CTAP onto the entire gp120 protein surface was performed by the Dockvision program 25 A grid box 125 125 125 with grid stepsize of 0 5 was created to cover the entire protein surface with enough area for the ligand to dock The default forcefield Research Potential Function was used to perform 1000 Monte Carlo runs for the docking Both ligand and the target protein were kept rigid Intermolecular energy criteria were used to identify the best possible dockings of CTAP Results Impaired infectivity of CAP treated HIV 1 Results of earlier studies indicated that HIV 1 infection of cells is inhibited in the presence of CAP ED 90 5 to 10 g ml for HIV 1 IIIB i e 200 nM 2 However the mechanism involved in the inhibitory activity and the possibility of virus inactivation by CAP have not been explored Results shown in Fig 1indicate that CAP in a dose dependent manner rapidly inactivates at 37 C HIV 1 IIIB an X4 virus and HIV 1 BaL an R5 virus the latter appearing relatively more resistant CAP retention on the surface of treated HIV 1 particles Evidence for CAP HIV 1 binding was obtained from results of solid phase immunoassays in which attachment of HIV 1 IIIB and BaL virus particles respectively detected by subsequent ELISA of p24 antigen released from virus particles by detergent treatment to wells precoated with CAP was measured Fig 2A CAP treated HIV 1 IIIB and BaL viruses unlike control viruses bound to wells coated with antibodies against phthalate Fig 2B These results indicate that treated HIV 1 particles utilizing either CXCR4 or CCR5 as coreceptors retain CAP on their surface and suggest that this is responsible for the altered properties and impaired infectivity of the treated viruses Identification of CAP binding sites on HIV 1 envelope glycoproteins The attachment sites on the surface of HIV 1 IIIB for CAP were determined from binding of control and CAP treated HIV 1 respectively to distinct ligands Fig 3 The quantities of control virus and treated virus in these experiments were identical as determined from the content of p24 antigen in preparations of detergent disrupted virus particles CAP binding to HIV 1 IIIB particles most profoundly affected their binding to the V3 loop specific mAbs 9284 26 and 9305 27 and to the coreceptor CXCR4 while binding to sCD4 to virus neutralizing mAbs specific for the CD4 binding site on gp120 b12 28 and 588D 29 to mAb 17b specific for a discontinuous conserved epitope proximal to the binding site for both CD4 and anti CD4 binding site antibodies 30 to mAb 2G12 specific for an epitope centered around the C3 V4 domain of gp120 also involving N linked glycans 31 and to the gp41 specific mAb 2F5 32 was less affected In order to determine whether R5 viruses are similarly affected by CAP the binding of HIV 1 BaL as a representative of this virus group to anti V3 BaL and CCR5 respectively before and after CAP treatment was studied The results shown in Fig 3indicate that the CAP treated HIV 1 BaL bound to these ligands much less than did untreated virus The binding of control and CAP treated HIV 1 IIIB to antibodies against peptides derived from gp120 gp41 16 was also determined In agreement with the results obtained using mAbs CAP treatment resulted in most pronounced decreases of virus binding to antibodies against peptide 303 338 V3 loop and the adjacent peptide 280 306 Fig 4 Pretreatment with CAP impairs gp120 binding to coreceptors Data reported so far suggest that the lethal hit to HIV 1 caused by CAP treatment involves the coreceptor binding site on gp120 To further support this conclusion the binding of labeled gp120 CD4 complexes to coreceptor 11 12 33 expressing cells was studied First it was determined from quantitative binding studies using CAP staining with ruthenium red 21 that pretreatment with CAP resulted in binding of 0 90 0 13 CAP molecules gp120 in TS The binding appeared augmented by 30 in 1 M NaCl The binding capacity of gp120 for sCD4 was preserved after CAP treatment Fig 5 On the other hand gp120 sCD4 complexes containing CAP treated gp120 bound to coreceptor expressing cells to a much lesser extent than similar complexes containing untreated gp120 Fig 6 Discussion Negatively charged sulfated polymers were reported to have anti HIV 1 activity and are being considered for development as topical microbicides They include dextran sulfate 34 35 carrageenans 35 36 dextrin 2 sulfate 37 38 cellulose sulfate 39 and naphthalene sulfonate polymer PRO 2000 40 Except for dextrin 2 sulfate and PRO 2000 which appear to have anti HIV 1 inhibitory activities similar to that of CAP the other sulfonated polymers are less inhibitory 34 35 41 HIV 1 may develop resistance to the inhibitory effect of dextran sulfate and R5 viruses were reported not to be inhibited by this polymer 42 43 Dextran sulfate was shown to bind to gp120 and to interfere with gp120 CXCR4 interactions but it did not bind to gp120 of R5 viruses 43 CAP in micronized form providing an acidic environment causes disintegration of HIV 1 leading to loss of infectivity 2 Here we have shown that CAP directly inactivates HIV 1 at neutral pH since treated virus particles after removal of excess CAP had reduced or no infectivity Fig 1 in agreement with recent observations 44 45 Virus inactivation can be attributed to strong binding of CAP to HIV 1 preventing the access to virus particles predominantly of antibodies against the gp120 V3 loop known to be involved in coreceptor binding and specificity 15 46 47 48 49 and to epitopes located adjacent to the V3 loop Fig 4 Indeed CAP binding to HIV 1 resulted in blockade of sites involved in coreceptor binding Fig 3 This was observed for both HIV 1 IIIB an X4 virus and HIV 1 BaL an R5 virus In agreement with this finding CAP inhibited infection by both X4 and R5 viruses in in vitro models for vaginal HIV 1 infection 45 50 Sites on the HIV 1 envelope other than the coreceptor binding domains may possibly be also involved in interactions with CAP contributing to inhibition of virus infection Studies with gp120 allowed to determine the stoichiometry of the reaction between gp120 and CAP resulting in the observation that approximately one CAP molecule binds to one molecule of gp120 Interestingly CAP gp120 binding also occurs in 1M NaCl conditions under which binding of sulfated polysaccharides to gp120 is abolished 43 This suggests that electrostatic interactions do not play an exclusive role in CAP gp120 binding 51 Since CAP has an approximate M w of 6 10 4and its structure has not been determined a model for CAP docking onto gp120 HXBc2 was generated using a chemically modified cellotetraose The entire gp120 surface was considered for docking acetylated and phthaloylated cellotetraose CTAP except the trimerization and CD4 binding sites on gp120 13 The two optimally docked CTAP molecules were selected for further analyses The first one marked as Dock1 in Fig 7 docked near regions corresponding to amino acid residues 361 392 indicated in red and 386 417 indicated in purple The orientation of CTAP revealed that if extended to generate the larger CAP molecule blockade of the coreceptor binding site indicated in gray in Fig 7 15 and the V3 loop indicated in yellow in Fig 7 would result These docking results agree with the observation that capture of CAP treated HIV 1 virions to antibodies against peptides from these regions 303 338 361 392 386 417 was decreased Fig 4 CTAP interacts primarily through several hydrogen bonds with gp120 residues K362 N386 Q389 N392 and T394 Though there were no hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions discernable such interactions cannot be ruled out as CTAP represents only a small part of the CAP molecule The second best docking positioned CTAP near the V3 loop marked as Dock2 in Fig 7 CTAP in this position interacts with gp120 through both hydrogen bonding residues R311 and R315 and hydrophobic forces F317 with two CH 3 CO units of CTAP The interacting region is in the RGPGRAF principal neutralizing domain PND of the V3 loop 52 Both R311 and R315 residues are also in close proximity to two acid groups of the CTAP phthalic acid moiety and may take part in electrostatic interactions Although CTAP is only a partial representation of the CAP molecule the docking simulations agree with the experimental results Results presented earlier 2 combined with those presented here suggest that CAP acts on HIV 1 by several mechanisms depending on pH and the physical form and concentration of this compound The direct virus inactivating effect of CAP the multiple mechanisms involved in prevention of HIV 1 infection the broad spectrum activity against several STD pathogens the established safety record low cost and availability in large scale suggest that CAP has advantages over other polymeric substances considered as topical vaginal microbicides for prevention of STDs including AIDS Conclusions Cellulose acetate phthalate CAP is a pharmaceutical excipient which has been used for over four decades for enteric film coating of tablets and capsules It is inexpensive and generally regarded as a nontoxic material free of adverse effects As such it is included in the US Food and Drug Administration Inactive Ingredients Guide Our earlier studies indicated that CAP inhibited infection by HIV 1 and several herpes viruses in vitro CAP was effective in blocking vaginal transmission of these viruses in animal model systems The underlying molecular machanisms for these inhibitory effects remained to be established Data presented here show that CAP remains bound to HIV 1 after removal of unreacted compound impairing virus infectivity due to blockade of binding sites for cellular coreceptors CXCR4 and CCR5 The industrial availability history of safe use and mechanism of anti HIV 1 activity i e virus inactivation rather than reversible inhibition suggest that CAP is an ideal candidate compound for a vaginal microbicide expected to prevent sexual transmission of HIV 1 List of Abbreviations used CAP cellulose acetate
