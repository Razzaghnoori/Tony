 Kosovo Con Games For weeks critics of the war in Yugoslavia have pronounced it unwinnable The atrocities continue unabated they say Air power alone will never get the job done It s another Vietnam President Clinton has blown it Everything we do makes the situation worse Whether Clinton and his allies can win the war remains to be seen But one thing is certain They can t win the debate over the war as long as critics are allowed to rig it with the following hidden premises A Selective Scrutiny 1 Policies Critics observe that many things have gone badly since the air war began Ethnic Albanians have been killed and expelled from Kosovo and anti American nationalism has grown in Russia It s easy to associate bad outcomes with the current policy But critics seldom apply the same kind of scrutiny to alternative policies If NATO had forsworn the use of force against the Serbs what would the Serbs ultimately have done to the Kosovar Albanians If NATO had launched a ground war what would Russia be doing now If as critics observe the Serbs have managed to cleanse Kosovo in less than four weeks what difference could NATO have made by beginning a ground force buildup which takes considerable time a month ago 2 Policy makers American reporters think their job is to examine U S policy makers not foreign policy makers So they discount Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic s behavior as an objective consequence of Clinton s subjective decisions When Serbian ethnic cleansing follows NATO bombing reporters treat the Serbian action not as the product of free will but as a reaction determined by NATO s action So while journalists on the ground report on Serbian atrocities journalists in the studios and the newsrooms in effect pass the blame to NATO and Clinton This bias has produced a bizarre blame America first spin on the right We have ignited the very human rights catastrophe the war was started to avoid declared Pat Buchanan on Face the Nation Columnist Arianna Huffington compared Kosovo to Waco arguing that just as Clinton s actions six years ago precipitated the murder suicides by the Branch Davidian cult in Waco Texas his intervention in Kosovo has unwittingly produced one of the great humanitarian catastrophes of the 20 th century While some conservatives allege that Clinton s unnecessary belligerence provoked the Serbs to ethnic cleansing others say his timidity about using ground troops emboldened the Serbs to the same effect Clinton even gets the blame for Russian hostility On Meet the Press Sen Judd Gregg R N H accused Clinton of pushing Russia into a corner and putting them in a position where they re no longer able to do anything but to react in an aggressive way towards our action 3 Moral actors When the Serbs butcher another 50 Kosovar Albanians or drive another 100 000 out of Kosovo it s a dog bites man story When NATO bombs what it thought was a military convoy and instead hits a caravan of civilian refugees killing scores it s a man bites dog story For several days the media treated the casualties caused by NATO as the lead story from Kosovo overshadowing far greater casualties caused during that time by the Serbs This may have cost NATO the moral high ground declared John McLaughlin invoking the moral equivalence formula usually despised by conservatives Meanwhile the Serbs role in pushing the refugees onto the road in the middle of a war zone was scarcely mentioned B Sleight of Hand Inferences 4 Unachieved to unachievable Today s media report news instantaneously and expect it to be made instantaneously as well In less than two weeks their verdict on the bombing of Yugoslavia leapt from unfulfilled objectives to failure to impossibility Since air power hasn t brought the Serbs to their knees in four weeks the media conclude that it never will Congressional Republicans have decided it s doomed to failure according to Fred Barnes Never mind that under NATO s plan the bombing will become more severe each week 5 Vietnam to Kosovo Critics constantly compare Kosovo to Vietnam They infer two lessons from Vietnam that gradual escalation never works and that bombing can t break an enemy s will The trick in invoking such analogies is to ignore the differences that the war in Kosovo is being waged by 19 countries against one that no superpower is willing to prop up the targeted country and that today s air power and surveillance are vastly more precise than the bombing technology used in Vietnam 6 Sinner to sin Critics on the right argue that because Clinton is untrustworthy so is the war As George Will put it last week the contempt of court citation against Clinton for falsely denying his affair with Monica Lewinsky is a timely reminder of the mendacity that drenches his presidency including his Balkan policy Meanwhile critics on the left argue that because the United States failed to intervene in Rwanda its intervention in Kosovo is morally suspect and probably racist C Hidden Dichotomies 7 Empirical moral Centuries ago scientific philosophers invented a strict separation between talking about the way the world is and talking about the way it ought to be Today s media following this premise separate editorial from news judgments The only standard by which news organizations feel comfortable evaluating a policy is success or failure not right or wrong So the media s consensus about Kosovo is that NATO s policy is not working As Tim Russert put it to Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott on Meet the Press The atrocities continue What success can you point to that any of your strategy has worked The alternative perspective goes overlooked that the question is what NATO must do that atrocities are a challenge rather than a verdict and that NATO should persevere precisely because they continue 8 Political military Critics say Clinton should have destroyed Serbian TV networks by now and never should have sworn off ground troops They deride these as political decisions and mock NATO for refusing to bomb Milosevic s palace because it contains cultural treasures including a Rembrandt The idea that Italy and Greece object to ground troops and therefore we shouldn t do what is necessary to win this war is in my view ridiculous protested Bill Kristol on This Week But what s the definition of winning Clinton and other NATO leaders say they re not just seeking a one time victory over Milosevic They re trying to develop what is essentially an international policing consortium This is a political as well as military project It entails compromising with allies who are more cautious about applying force and authorizing targets Otherwise the United States would have to police the world alone which is unsustainable politically thanks in part to vociferous opposition from many of these same critics not to mention militarily 9 Harm help Skeptics maintain that the bombing isn t helping the Kosovars I don t care about dropping any more bridges into the Danube River Buchanan fumed on Face the Nation I don t know how that helps those people in Kosovo The question he argued should be What is the best way to help these people and save these lives Not how we can bomb another oil plant or oil refinery Minutes later host Bob Schieffer ended the show by noting that the Kosovars were still being purged and asking whether what we are doing is doing any good This dichotomy rules out the fallback strategy that NATO and U S officials have articulated from the outset to make the cost of Milosevic s victory outweigh the rewards Conservatives used to defend this concept which they called deterrence when it was preached and practiced by President Reagan If the punishment you administer to the current troublemaker fails to stop him the theory goes at least it will make the next troublemaker think twice D Self Fulfilling Doubts 10 Practical futility The pundits verdict is in The war is doomed and already lost On Late Edition Wolf Blitzer observed that Milosevic doesn t give after a month of this any impression that he is backing down Quoting a report that U S military leaders see no sign that Milosevic is changing his strategy or about to break Russert asked Talbott Are we losing this war Other talking heads asserted that NATO is not united and won t be able to stand up as the conflict wears on Time is not on our side warned former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft on Late Edition It is going to be very difficult to keep the alliance together Of course the best way to assure that Milosevic doesn t break that NATO comes apart and that the United States loses the war is to predict that Milosevic won t break that NATO will come apart and that the United States will lose the war These predictions bolster the Serbs morale while undermining NATO s As Sen Chris Dodd D Conn observed on Face the Nation Patience and resolve are as important a weapon today as actually the airstrikes are 11 Moral authority Rather than call Clinton a liar many pundits pass this off as a widespread perception by others They call it a moral authority and public relations problem asking how it will impact his ability to lead Americans and NATO in war There is a common drum beat on the airwaves a reporter asked Clinton on April 15 that you personally lack the moral authority to be commander in chief New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd warned that Clinton does not inspire great loyalty adding He may have a conflict of interest if he sends in ground troops It would be hard to save his skin and their skin at the same time By questioning Clinton s moral authority in this pseudo objective way journalists destroy what s left of his moral authority 12 NATO credibility Self styled hawks fret that NATO will lose the war and thereby expose its impotence This lumbering and clumsy alliance incapable of managing such brush fires as Kosovo could lose the Kosovo war in a month against the ruin of a rump state warned columnist Charles Krauthammer If the perception is that for 26 days tiny little Yugoslavia has withstood NATO and the United States asked Russert will NATO and the United States be exposed as a paper tiger Russert s guest Sen Richard Lugar R Ind grimly intoned Many are predicting that this will be the funeral of NATO And all because in Krauthammer s words Clinton staked the survival of the most successful alliance in history on bright new academic ideas cooked up far from the battlefields on which they now flounder Having defined anything less than the total recapture of Kosovo and the restoration of its refugees as a failure Clinton s critics are ensuring that such failure will be interpreted as catastrophically as possible As for their suggestion that NATO s credibility is too precious to be risked in war you can understand their reluctance Even tough guys have their Rembrandt
