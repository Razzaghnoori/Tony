 THE ISLANDS AND THEIR PEOPLE The Balearic Islands don t have to work too hard to embody the perfect island vacation Mallorca and Menorca are blessed with the sort of natural and man made attributes that entice countless millions of foreign visitors to descend upon them and to keep returning year after year the perfect deep blue and transparent turquoise of the Mediterranean Sea 300 plus days of brilliant annual sunshine hundreds of miles of coastline secluded coves and wide bays and a vast choice of cheap flights and accommodations Since the 1960s Mallorca has shone in its role as Spain s tourism juggernaut defining the extremes of a Mediterranean holiday the unbridled hedonism of topless beaches and singles bars and the lethargic point A hotel to point B beach vacation Wealthy visitors to the island enjoy privileged holidays revolving around second homes boating and sailing The image was established early and the cash registers have been ringing ever since But tourism pulls islanders in opposite directions on the Balearics Income derived from a well orchestrated travel industry has made this region Spain s wealthiest per capita but the environmental and psychological effects of being Europe s playground have left locals a bit desperate Four decades after it exploded tourism on the islands overheated leaving in its ashes a forest of massive block booked hotels and beach hugging villa communities with few discernible ties to Spain places lined with German bier halls English fish n chips joints and low rent bars and discos At a time when countries are going to new extremes battling for their share of the world tourism pie Mallorca and Menorca are reassessing their enduring popularity Fearing that overdevelopment as well as new trends and tastes in international tourism would leave the Balearics behind authorities have moved to protect remaining undeveloped areas as nature preserves proclaiming them off limits to all construction and have even blown up some of the more unsightly hotel blemishes on the coasts The people and governments of Mallorca and Menorca have recognized a need to choose between surrendering the natural beauty and easygoing lifestyle of their islands to the ravenous consumption of foreign vacationers and homebuyers and protecting what s left of each Happily there s still a lot that hasn t yet been adulterated on the two islands meaning that visitors also have a choice They can join hordes of their sun deprived brethren from Great Britain Germany and other countries and enjoy an island vacation with a cheap place to stay familiar food glorious beaches and a few day excursions thrown in for variety The summer season grows longer every year and significant stretches of both islands are still packed with merrymakers and families delighting in the traditional Mediterranean island vacation Or if that thought is less appealing to you though as it is to increasing numbers of travelers you ll find another side to the Balearics It is more chic than cheap a place where ecologically sensitive hotels are built in restored 16th century manor and farm houses where hiking cycling and golf complement or replace entirely the long days at the beach It is place to eat fine Mallorcan Menorcan and Spanish cuisine rather than pizza and French fries This other Balearics may not be as inexpensive or as accessible as the one sold by travel operators but if visitors venture beyond the well trodden tracks of their packaged predecessors they ll discover a spectacularly beautiful part of the world If you come expecting a nightmarish land of charter flights tour buses and beer stained beach hangouts you may be shocked at how remote and undeveloped many parts of these small islands remain From medieval mountain villages and the dramatic lunar landscape of Mallorca s Formentor promontory to mysterious prehistoric settlements and isolated beaches accessible only by foot on Menorca the islands abound with sights that are anything but blandly international Slowly but surely visitors are graduating from sterile hotels and apartment blocks to home rentals time shares and casas rurales country house hotels that form part of the government s agrotourism initiatives No longer the sole habitat of sun worshippers the islands welcome thousands of cyclists in early spring April and May bring hikers to exclaim over wildflowers and bird watchers with binoculars and zoom lenses record rarities and migrants on their way north Previous generations moved inland to get out of range of marauding pirates Islanders who stayed put and didn t flee to the coast to work the tourism industry can live almost unmolested by beach bound modern invaders Against the odds much of the islands traditional life and values has been preserved and while agriculture is no longer the dominant income source plenty of people still have little connection to tourism This is especially true on Menorca where cold winter winds limit the season s length Mallorca the largest of the four Balearics is also the most geographically varied The dramatic cliffs of the Serra de Tramuntana mountain range hug the coastline of the entire northwest and north from Andratx all the way to the Cape of Formentor The north coast boasts some of Spain s most stunning scenery miniscule coves dizzying drops to the sea picturesque medieval villages and a single port at S ller The interior of Mallorca is a vast plain of small industrial towns farmlands and ancient gnarly olive and almond trees all protected from Mediterranean winds by the rugged mountains The south is dominated by the cosmopolitan island capital Palma de Mallorca its handsome bay and the crowded beaches that splay outward from it The east coast is an enticing mix of bays long sweeps of beach small coves spectacular caves and myriad tourist villas Menorca is the second largest of the Balearic archipelago but it s tiny just the same only 50 km 31 miles long and 17 km 10 miles across at its widest point Predominantly rural and flat Menorca has always been a quieter place than Mallorca or the craziest of the Balearics party mad Ibiza Still its hidden coves remarkable natural harbors and more than 1 000 Megalithic monuments inscrutable remnants of the island s prehistoric origins are dazzling Menorca gets big time package holidaymakers especially from Great Britain and beaches and roads get awfully crowded in the height of the summer season but the island seldom feels frenetic With all these things going for them including a friendly easygoing population conversant in several languages it s not surprising that the Balearics continue to reel in short and long term visitors by the millions Many northern Europeans especially Germans have purchased summer and retirement homes here during the months of July and August Spaniards are flatly outnumbered when the dominant languages are German and English In parts of Mallorca Germans own about 80 percent of all homes along traditionally British vacation spots on Menorca three quarters of the homes are first or second residences belonging to the English Understandably locals patience can get a bit frayed by the end of summer It is being tested further as more visitors buy into the old towns and villages instead of just coastal resorts But foreign invasions are nothing new to these islanders They were conquered successively by Carthaginians Romans Vandals Christians and Moors Slightly less possessive but equally curious visitors arrived including the lovers George Sand and Fr d ric Chopin Archduke Louis Salvator of Austria Ana s Nin and the poet Robert Graves The islands are now invaded by modern royalty like Claudia Schiffer Michael Douglas as well as princes and their paramours who anchor their yachts in the ports and evade the paparazzi Many islanders have learned to regard the latest occupations with a sense of dry humor All the previous occupiers have come and eventually gone they say and these too will one day leave
