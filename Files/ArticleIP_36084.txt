 P Is the quot Sensation quot Art Worth the Fuss P Dear David You accuse me of being overly literal and insist that I m not sufficiently sensitive to surface shape color and the formal qualities of art I make no apologies for my taste Henrik Ibsen once wrote that you can t chose whom you fall in love with you can t choose what works of art you fall in love with either To me a great work of art is roughly equal to a great phone conversation it pulls you out of your own head and allows you to join with someone else May I add that I find formalism entirely overrated I think it s led to a lot of arid deadening art It may sound old fashioned to say so but I do want art to reflect lived experience rather than just classroom questions I think one of the problems of contemporary art is that it has lost touch with the big themes namely love and nature and death These of course are literary themes rather than art themes yet I think that the artists in Sensation are helping to bring narrative back into art Britain of course is a literary culture and basically I feel that the Sensation artists are grafting literary themes onto avant garde forms devised in America In other words Americans true to myth we re all cowboys are good at busting up established conventions and Brits who actually read books are good at finding metaphorical meaning in the forms that we over here conceived Let s talk about Mona Hatoum for a moment who I realize is Palestinian but who lives in London and is part of the Sensation generation I loved her wittily titled Deep Throat a real life dinner table chastely set for one I looked at it and thought to myself It s a 3 D Anita Brookner novel I think the piece says something about female loneliness but it does more than that too because the lung projected via laser onto the dinner plate brings anatomy into the equation What does the piece mean Lungs allow us to breathe but here the act of breathing seems to guarantee little beside the likelihood of dining alone And now I head off to lunch by myself Until later Deborah P S What do you think of Richard Billingham s photographs of his down and out parents I think there s a lot of tenderness in his work P P S I realize I will never convince you of Sarah Lucas worth I think of her as Duchamp s daughter but are you at least willing to concede that Charles Saatchi deserves points for taking a gamble on young artists instead of just buying de Koonings and Frank Stellas and the blue chip stuff that other collectors favor When collectors buy a de Kooning painting they do not help the art world they merely help the art market Saatchi by contrast has kept a whole generation of artists from having to wait tables
