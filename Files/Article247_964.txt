 Headline Katha Yes I m a skeptic about marriage and its idealizers To my mind the best marriages are rooted in friendship not romantic love or very rarely in romantic love which somehow manages to evolve into friendship That s a good deal of what my next book is about It s often a miracle when it works especially given our culture s bizarrely high expectations of the institution So it seems to me to behoove those who believe in the virtues of marriage to be more effusive in their praise when a couple manages to carry off this difficult relationship especially when it involves children as well as the McCartneys did But Paul and Linda s countercultural roots are an embarrassment to the Right and their traditional adherence to fidelity and bourgeois bliss embarrasses the Left So the McCartneys are without their champions But they are surely more admirable in their modern embrace of traditional values than say representative Bob Barr As to equal marriage rights it is very frustrating to see people on the right and left completely equate the right to marriage with the duty to marry I think it has to do with the fact that it is so inconceivable to most straight people that they couldn t have the right to marry that it is literally unimaginable to put themselves in gay people s shoes Right now unlike you Katha I do not have the option of choosing against marriage or embracing the non traditional forms of relationship you seem to like I m stuck with them whether I like it or not You cannot spurn marriage if you cannot also choose it And you can t reject marriage if it has never been offered to you What I m arguing for is a simple equality in that choice Where marriage can work for gay people and successful marriages will be as rare I think as they are for straights then we should rejoice and be happy Where marriage doesn t fit people s needs or desires then there s no reason for people to feel constrained to be a part of it It s a free country after all But the right to choose such a thing even if that choice will make you miserable for the rest of your life is so fundamental to our culture s and constitution s definition of the pursuit of happiness that to deny it to anyone for something they cannot change is a grotesque and deep injustice I can t think of a deeper denial of civil rights in this country can you Which is to say that just as gay people should have the right to be as boring and as traditional and as conservative as everybody else so too should they have the right to be as miserable in their relationships Or in the rare case like the McCartneys very very happy best andrew
