 Movies 8MM Columbia Pictures Nicolas Cage plays a straight arrow private eye who enters the seamy world of hard core porn in pursuit of information about a girl in a snuff film Critics reactions are all over the map Roger Ebert gives the film three stars and says it deals with the materials of violent exploitation films but in a non pornographic way it would rather horrify than thrill it is a real film Not a slick exploitation film with all the trappings of depravity but none of the consequences the Chicago Sun Times Several critics take the exact opposite stance The Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan calls it an unapologetically sleazy ordeal that delights in twisting the knife a tawdry piece of work whose only raison d tre is making the skin crawl in the name of box office profit Most reactions to the film are negative but each critic cites a different flaw Odd man out Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post so unfazed by the subject matter as to call the film insipid and mild David Edelstein s review in Slate 200 Cigarettes Paramount Pictures Critics call this piece of early 80s nostalgia a dismally unfunny farce Todd McCarthy Daily Variety There are plenty of interesting stars Christina Ricci Courtney Love Ben Affleck Janeane Garofalo but the script which follows a gaggle of young folks on their way to a New Year s Eve bash in Manhattan s East Village is said to be

Times Those who condemn the film say its real message is m entally challenged people in love say the darnedest things Desson Howe the Washington Post However quite a few softies like it Lewis and Ribisi eventually win you over Turan the Los Angeles Times by the storybook conclusion I was cheering them on against all critical instinct Rod Dreher the New York Post Stephen Holden of the New York Times opens his review with what sounds like a joke A beautifully acted love story but isn t he s the film s biggest fan Check out this site devoted to Ribisi Books The Houdini Girl by Martyn Bedford Pantheon Bedford s sophomore novel after the acclaimed Acts of Revision is called a gripping but flawed work The story follows a young magician uncovering the details of his girlfriend s recent death and unpeeling the layers of deception that she had wrapped herself in The thriller side of the book is well crafted and the dialogue pacing and plotting keep reviewers engaged Bedford is the genuine

emotional lives Read the first chapter courtesy of the New York Times requires free registration Perfect Murder Perfect Town by Lawrence Schiller HarperCollins Jumbled messy and frustrating to read Christopher Lehmann Haupt the New York Times is how most reviewers describe this rushed to press book about the JonBenet Ramsey murder Not only does the book repeat and contradict itself but the

play has been stunningly staged critics praise the acting direction and costumes but they debate whether the work itself is amateurish or fully formed The New York Times Ben Brantley concedes that there are definitely moments to wince over and that it is the work of a man still unsure of his voice but still sees enough flashes of brilliance to make the performance worthwhile Daily Variety s
