                uh  what have you had any home repairs done lately on your home   well thats thats something um yeah we have its a very timely subject i think in the Spring everybody decides that theyre going to start over and do something with their house and we started last year an we have a little i guess its a sixteen hundred foot house and its just my husband and i here but um we decided that uh we wanted to build a sun room and um its a good thing we got a contractor i mean this is not something you need to do by yourself so we ended up with a contractor and went through that whole schmeal with um the contractor saying one thing and then doing another and and uh anyway we ended up with uh a really neat sun room on the back of the house its beautiful its like two hundred square foot but thats not um something we did by ourselves if you talk about home repairs um Toms real good at mowing the grass and doing the garden so thats about it   yeah we uh  of course we have a new house that weve uh that we bought about a year ago and its been a chore just getting the uh builder to come back and finish everything up the way its supposed to   isnt that amazing   uh yeah its been an experience  its one i dont want to repeat anytime soon but weve had some we havent had anything really major uh wrong other than uh we did have like a water leak in the wall in the in the garage and   yeah   and uh the water heater upstairs in the attic it uh had a little leak and leaked down in uh under the ceiling and they had to come in and do some tape and bedding and repaint you know treat the ceiling but nothing nothing major those those kind of things really werent major uh just some of those kind of things that can happen   yeah   but uh just getting him out there to finish up and that sort of thing was has been a real effort     all those little details that you you dont really understand you know like we had some water leaks in the um well in the sun room there was a part that was fiberboard and you know tape and bed over that and when it did rain of course the only way to tell if this place leaks is to see if uh what happens after it rains   uhhuh   and of course it leaked  um which is no big deal because they said theyd come fix it well thats true but you know fixing the tape and bedding to make it look nice again its its   its hard its hard to make it fit perfectly   its a chore and a half without tearing the whole thing out and repainting and doing everything again   well fortunately ours was on the ceiling where they had the blow in ceiling the little uh   oh   the little the little you know uh styrofoam balls that they paint over so it was easy to disguise that but uh it was in an area where you dont really look at very much so we were lucky in that respect   yeah i dont know i i guess you get this idea that everything should be perfect and you know what this isnt a perfect world   no however i do think that a lot of times contractors try to get out of doing things that they say theyre going to do and uh   it but you do oh i know because every time they send somebody out they have to take them off a crew thats making money doing a job and they have to send them back to you where theyre not making any money trying to repair something that you know should have been right in the first place   yeah and and then they dont do a real good job doing it too they just kind of get get it done as quickly as possible   yeah well i was real happy with our contractor um actually i wasnt happy with the contractor i was happy with the job foreman so i think that made all the difference because he was pretty um you know concerned about how it looked and and you know how it should be done the right way and he gave us a lot of clues you just wish you knew all this stuff going in that um it was funny because we didnt understand a lot of things that we had to do in addition to this you know like the tape and bedding and and doing finishing off this wall and that wall that wasnt in the contract you know kind of thing so that was kind of interesting   yeah they i i like when they come in of course i designed my own house im i ive had prior experience in design and building and stuff like that so i know basically if its done right the problem is i dont want to do anymore   oh neat oh yeah   i want someone to do it for me       and uh just trying to get them to do what they say theyre going to do is a real effort   yeah well weve taken this another step further this year were going to build a deck weve got some people building uh a deck out in the back you know to complete sort of the back yard kind of thing and um   well i could recommend something there if if you know if if its not just cost prohibitive   oh yeah   for you uh ive built probably three decks on three different houses   oh   and the first time i went with regular just treated pine kind of a womanized pine and then i i treated spray treated it with some um   uhhuh   um panta oil which you have to do about every two years   okay   the problem with that is it warps after a couple of years then and you have to start replacing boards   i was wondering about that yeah   the second time i did it out of cedar which i soaked in Thompson Water Seal   uhhuh   and that works fine but there again it it discolors real bad   you soaked it oh yeah   you know the sun and everything else it just makes it look gray and dull an and it doesnt look attractive after a a few years the wood lasts fine but the color i was real dissatisfied   the color is what youre yeah sometimes after   and if you can stand the additional expense which you youll recoup after a while because it will last forever is the redwood if youll go with the redwood   thats thats what were doing is just the redwood and were doing it where they use the screws that are um  theyre not nails theyre the screws have   theyre screws the self adhesive screws all right   yeah those and so theyre not going to split and and i was really concerned about bugs really when i when we were considering other types of wood because you know termites can be a real hazard around here   you have to pretty much spray them regularly you know under an and around or whatever so you want to leave yourself uh enough space to get under it or or be able to lift it up   yeah   on some ends a lot of times they wont even detach them to the ground they just lay them up on some cinder blocks underneath in the ground   umhum   and theyre heavy enough where they wont the wind wont pick them up or they wont shift if its big enough and heavy enough so theyre several ways of doing it but the redwood is by by far the best and i would and i would also insist on that they do treat that with Thompsons Water Seal   that yeah thats thats the end part thats where you you know get the uh thats the part we have to do we got that up front we figured it out you know we need to know what we need to do um thats not included in this and thats one of the uh details but thats fine as long as they tell you   yeah yeah   its so funny because Tom is getting more and more adept at doing things its just things like painting just always used to really scare me he didnt know where to start um you know with a paint can you know an   well it is its its a frightening experience the one thing you might do if he will deliver the boards that he is going to make the under structure with   it sure is umhum   before he starts doing the construction to go ahead and do the water seal   oh and do the water seal floor   on those and then when he cuts them and puts them together then thatll already be treated and a fast way of doing that if youll go get a piece of guttering material like a little trough   uhhuh   and cover cover both ends or some sort of something that that will fit in   okay   and   i got you covered there   pour that in pour the water Thompsons Water Seal in there and then just put that in there and turn them over several times and let them set and soak in   kind of like marinate them yeah   thats right that that works wonders it i know it takes a lot of extra time but its its by far worth it   and thats just a water sealing and what happens if they arent water sealed   well over a period of time any any lumber will deteriorate   yeah will deteriorate yeah   now redwood would take quite a few years it depends on how many years you you plan to stay there   yeah   but uh redwood even if you dont treat it properly will begin to discolor and will begin to degrade even though it will be strong structurally strong and and will be there for a lot longer   yeah they did tell us that wed have to you know every couple of years just you know do brush up on the color um   actually if you do the the water seal correctly   umhum   you dont even have to do that   oh really   ive seen decks that are ten years old that uh that still have never had the had the uh the water proof stain put back over it or whatever   huh   and uh or they even have some rejuvenator that you can put on there that makes the redwood color come back but its expensive and and and most cases if you do it properly it will not even be required   well thats a really interesting tip and uh definitely something Tom could handle doing that   yeah and and the Thompsons is is good because you can roll it on with a roller you can spray it on you can   yeah he suggested just getting uh um a uh um a mop like you would use   or or a mop anything you can put that on with anything whereas a lot of this other stuff you have to you have to actually sit down and paint it with a brush   a mop just paint it yeah   uh and or spray it but then youve got to worry about the over spray whereas this stuff is clear   uhhuh   even if you got it on the side of some of your bricks or or on your concrete it wouldnt hurt anything   you couldnt tell oh   you would never be able to know it so   well thats definitely interesting so here we go with another home project   well it its kind of fun though things like that especially something like that where where youre outside youre not worrying about something inside the house that you can mess up outside you can learn a lot by doing that   it is i like   well like i said Tom does great with his garden i i always uh enjoyed working on the crew in the plays and building stuff so im im really in infatuated with building things and   well and its and it could be cheaper in the long run and   and making things   you know   but theres nothing like getting a perfect
