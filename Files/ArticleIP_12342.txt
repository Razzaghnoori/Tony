 Triple Threats Re Timothy Noah s Chatterbox item William Jefferson Clinton Joel Achenbach explained the three name serial killer phenomenon in a column included in his book Why Things Are Newspapers use all three names for such people to minimize the number of people with similar names mistakenly thought by distant cousins high school sweethearts and potential employers to be murderers and to minimize possible lawsuits from the John Kennedy Gacys and Karla Onderdunk Tuckers of the world Of course it s hard to imagine anyone making that mistake in Clinton s case Honey is that guy they re impeaching the same Bill Clinton who used to sell tires over at Pep Boys So you are correct to say the three namedness is rather unnecessary here Randolph B Cohen Cambridge Mass Time Is What s Heavy Atul Gawande throws out some interesting hypotheses about the link between obesity and poverty in his article Here s another Perhaps the future is more valuable to rich people than to poor people Every time someone eats a piece of cake or smokes a cigarette they are implicitly trading future life minutes for current sensual pleasures If we assume that almost everyone derives the same amount of pleasure from a given piece of cake then the amount of cake you will eat depends upon how much utility you assign to your life in the future Rich people may be happier overall and may therefore attribute more value to the future life minutes that they would be giving up by eating that cake This would cause millionaires to eat less cake and to quit smoking and to exercise more Tim DeRoche San

about Clarence Thomas Yes I know that there is no definite proof that Justice Thomas lied under oath to the Senate subcommittee when he said that Anita Hill s allegations were false but if the Republican House believes that felony perjury is impeachable aren t they obliged to thoroughly investigate the possibility that Thomas lied Srinivasan Sethuraman Princeton N J Guilty Is Guilty Is Guilty Michael Kinsley s article Lies Damned Lies and Impeachment seems to argue that if one criminal gets away with it then all criminals should be able to do likewise That hardly seems defensible The only valid argument is that you don t believe Clinton actually broke the law If you believe that he broke the law then he must be held accountable Whether that s now or after his term is over I suppose could be up for discussion although it s hard for me to believe that any rational person could believe that in the current atmosphere Clinton will be able to be an effective president regardless of who is to blame Gregg Tavares Japan The Greatest President Since Nixon More and more and particularly in Michael Kinsley s article Lies Damned Lies and Impeachment I notice that the main line of defense for the president is to compare him to people who might be worse This usually means members of the opposing party Isn t there any argument to be made that originates in some redeeming value of the president Ronald Keller St Albans W V Laughing All the Way to Court As a sometimes evidence teacher I read Bruce Gottlieb s item How Blind Must Justice Be with interest He states If by laughing the audience intended to say we don t believe you it is hearsay and therefore inadmissible This is wrong both as a statement of the hearsay rule and as a prediction of the likely outcome in this case First the rule A large amount probably most of hearsay is admissible That s because the Federal Rules of Evidence which apply at the Microsoft trial contain 30 exceptions to the hearsay rule some of them gaping For example Rule 807 the so called catch all exception permits hearsay to be admitted if it is the best available evidence of a material fact and the interests of justice will best be served by its admission a big window Now application of rule to facts If the question posed ever came up I am sure the evidence would be admitted under Rule 807 That s because the danger that the out of court statement is a lie the primary danger against which the hearsay rule protects is negligible when it is the simultaneous statement of hundreds of people This is what my evidence professor Kenneth Graham referred to as Surreptitious Principle No 1 A little bit of hearsay is bad but a whole lot of it is good Fred Bernstein New York City
