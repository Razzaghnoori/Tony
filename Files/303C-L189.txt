 FRANK O BANNON GOVERNOR Dear Friend In looking back at 1998 and forward to the new millennium we can be thankful that these are prosperous times for Indiana More Hoosiers are working and earning higher incomes than at any time in our history We are creating new businesses jobs and housing at a record pace And our population is growing for the first time in decades As our state continues to develop we must work harder to protect important natural areas for wildlife and recreation Thousands of Hoosier motorists have been doing just that by purchasing environmental license plates Nearly 416 000 of the distinctive plates with the eagle and sun design have been sold or renewed generating more than 10 million since 1993 The Indiana General Assembly also has played an important part appropriating 10 million for the program The Indiana Heritage Trust program has bought and protected more than 20 000 acres for parks forests wildlife nature preserves and recreation Three years ago the Heritage Trust set aside land for the restoration of the Limberlost Swamp near Geneva in eastern Indiana This is the wetland celebrated by Gene Stratton Porter in her books poems and photographs Now wildlife is returning to the area Egrets ducks and geese now gather at waterfowl resting ponds in large numbers and native prairie grass has been planted to return natural diversity and other wildlife to the area The Limberlost is one of more than 75 projects in which you have invested by purchasing an environmental license plate One year ago I asked you to join me in renewing your environmental license plate so our children and grandchildren can see the majesty of a bald eagle soaring over Indiana s rural hills and valleys so we can float down a river in a canoe and enjoy the breathtaking scenery or so we can hike through the woods and see wildflowers in the spring I ask you to join me again this year in supporting the program that is doing so much to preserve and protect our natural heritage Sincerely Frank O Bannon
