 all right now we used to be big time campers but now we re not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports uh huh what type of camping did you do well when we before we had kids we was in a motorcycle group you know we we went like twenty or thirty at a time we took uh just our little tents uh huh uh huh and we did it that way then when we started having children we bought a camper you know and we did it that way oh uh huh oh how neat so we ve always enjoyed camping uh huh well i know i have um i just have a tent and the kids and i like to go out and camp in the tent and then i bought a van and that way i can sleep in the van and be more comfortable uh huh yes yes now we have friends with a van and when they go on vacation a lot of times they ll just sleep in the van you know uh huh right like one night and the next night they ll stay at the motel you know or something like that and they enjoy it yeah uh huh yes i don t i don t think i m a real true trooper you know when it comes to camping all the bugs and stuff but i i try oh yeah oh me either i hate to be on any that stuff but but i try you know to uh to get out there and enjoy everything but what was so fun though is that i had to take my son to the doctor this morning because he went out camping with some friends and he got poison ivy oh yeah oh and it s all over him the poor thing you know so there s definitely hazards to going camping if you don t know what you re looking at yes yes oh shoot oh but now i enjoy it every once in a while i mean it s not something i d want to do real often i m a sissy i either want to do it in the fall or spring you know uh huh yeah right right definitely when it s cool well have you done much camping around Texas yes well not really because usually it s when we go off you know like for a couple weeks or so it s usually like that uh huh uh huh yeah well have you camped all over the United States just about wow see now i haven t so that i bet you that s an experience there just about oh it really is it really is also i said we mostly did ours before we started a family uh huh uh huh right right it s a lot easier then well i know my parents like to camp a lot and they uh they ve been going to Gulf Shores Alabama oh uh huh and uh which is really really neat they said they ve got the white beaches and the sand and it s not real populated so they can they feel like they re in the outdoors and still close to the ocean and uh from what i understand from them it s really really pretty there yes uh huh oh i d like to go anywhere you know i just like to go uh huh uh huh i really do well have you done much camping up in Kentucky and and those parts in the mountains no not really not that much um we ve been well we ve been to Wyoming you know and Kentucky and Montana and you know places like that but usually if we re with a group of people we really don t stay any one place very long uh huh you know like if we re just going through and they camp one night and then head on right right but now that we have children and we go every blue moon i d rather just go to Galveston yeah oh yeah yeah yeah rent a beach house or something yeah that s that s my idea of camping you know yes yes yes but we re uh we re getting more into it and we ve done uh we ve done quite a bit and uh uh the kids like to go out you know as often as they can um so that s good you know they re they re becoming enthusiasts then of camping uh huh uh huh it is my children really enjoys it they really do but by the time we really get a chance to it s July you know and it s so hot right uh huh uh huh and our camper does doesn t have an air conditioner oh yeah yeah it s one of those pop ups i m sure you could put one in probably but we hadn t did that uh huh uh huh uh huh yeah well that s really neat yes we all enjoy camping and they re you know they re in like R As and scouts and stuff like that you know so they get to go camping in those organizations also well uh huh uh huh at least their daddy goes with them i don t when they do that but yeah yeah oh that s neat that s really neat that really is well how old is your boys your children well i well i have um a son that s uh going to be eleven here pretty soon and then a daughter that s thirteen uh huh so they re they re getting old enough to where they can help out with a campfire and cooking and and all that kind of stuff too oh yes yeah yes and that s that s really neat it really is mine s eleven and eight uh huh so they really enjoy it too yeah yeah yeah i i agree with you they like to get out there and but this wasn t so fun this last time for Nathan to to get out there and he didn t realize he was touching poison ivy and it got all into his eye and it was really swollen and uh so they had to give him shots and everything so oh well maybe next time he ll stay away from those particular yeah yeah yes yes trees or what bushes whatever they are oh but i have uh brother in law and a sister you know that just really just camp you know they love to go camping they could they would all the time they wanted you know wanted to because there s nothing holding them back but i m just not that involved in it uh huh uh huh uh huh no now i like to go out like several times a year but not on a on the regular basis i have some friends who go out every single weekend when you know in the season uh and and i just couldn t do that you know yeah oh uh huh me i haven t really as far as entertainment i don t know what you would do if yeah yeah you know but i guess my entertainment s television i guess just getting away yeah right right see i see they just want to get away uh huh but every Friday night they ll go home you know straight from work and they ll pack up and you know and then they ll leave and i m just going you know by Friday night i just want to crash you know and i want to go home and you know do all that and then uh get out on the road to boot so oh i don t either uh huh but anyway that s their life yes but they probably live in a city also don t they yeah yeah that s true well see we re in a real small county area and you know that makes a big difference uh huh now that s true that s true because if we want to go camping we can just go just a few miles you know yeah that s true that makes a difference well it was nice talking with you okay it was nice talking to you too and we ll probably be talking to you again okay okay bye bye okay well take care bye bye
