 Human Clones Why Not If you can clone a sheep you can almost certainly clone a human being Some of the most powerful people in the world have felt compelled to act against this threat President Clinton swiftly imposed a ban on federal funding for human cloning research Bills are in the works in both houses of Congress to outlaw human cloning a step urged on all governments by the pope himself Cloning humans is taken to be either 1 a fundamentally evil thing that must be stopped or at the very least 2 a complex ethical issue that needs legislation and regulation But what exactly is so bad about it Start by asking whether human beings have a right to reproduce I say yes I have no moral right to tell other people they shouldn t be able to have children and I don t see that Bill Clinton has that right either When Clinton says Let us resist the temptation to copy ourselves it comes from a man not known for resisting other temptations of the flesh And for a politician making noise about cloning is pretty close to a fleshly temptation itself It s an easy way to show sound bite leadership on an issue that everybody is talking about without much risk of bitter consequences After all how much federally funded research was stopped by this ban Probably almost none because Clinton has maintained Ronald Reagan s policy of minimizing federal grants for research in human reproduction Besides most researchers thought cloning humans was impossible so for the moment there s unlikely to be a grant request backlog There is nothing like banning the nonexistent to show true leadership The pope unlike the president is known for resisting temptation He also openly claims the authority to decide how people reproduce I respect the pope s freedom to lead his religion and his followers freedom to follow his dictate But calling for secular governments to implement a ban thus extending his power beyond those he can persuade shows rather explicitly that the pope does not respect the freedom of others The basic religious doctrine he follows was set down some two millennia ago Sheep feature prominently in the Bible but cloning does not So the pope s views on cloning are 1 st century rules applied using 15 th century religious thinking to a 21 st century issue If humans have a right to reproduce what right does society have to limit the means Essentially all reproduction is done these days with medical help at delivery and often before Truly natural human reproduction would mean 50 percent infant mortality and make pregnancy related death the No 1 killer of adult women True some forms of medical help are more invasive than others With in vitro fertilization the sperm and egg are combined in the lab and surgically implanted in the womb Less than two decades ago a similar concern was raised over the ethical issues involved in test tube babies To date nearly 30 000 such babies have been born in the United States alone Many would be parents have been made happy Who has been harmed The cloning procedure is similar to IVF The only difference is that the DNA of sperm and egg would be replaced by DNA from an adult cell What law or principle secular humanist or religious says that one combination of genetic material in a flask is OK but another is not No matter how closely you study the 1 st century texts I don t think you ll find the answer Even if people have the right to do it is cloning a good idea Suppose that every prospective parent in the world stopped having children naturally and instead produced clones of themselves What would the world be like in another 20 or 30 years The answer is much like today Cloning would only copy the genetic aspects of people who are already here Hating a world of clones is hating the current populace Never before was Pogo so right We have met the enemy and he is us Adifferent scare scenario is a world filled with copies of famous people only We ll treat celebrity DNA like designer clothes hankering for Michael Jordan s genes the way we covet his Nike sneakers today But even celebrity infatuation has its limits People are not more taken with celebrities than they are with themselves Besides such a trend would correct itself in a generation or two because celebrity is closely linked to rarity The world seems amused by one Howard Stern but give us a hundred or a million of them and they ll seem a lot less endearing Clones already exist About one in every 1 000 births results in a pair of babies with the same DNA We know them as identical twins Scientific studies on such twins reared together or apart show that they share many characteristics Just how many they share is a contentious topic in human biology But genetic determinism is largely irrelevant to the cloning issue Despite how many or how few individual characteristics twins or other clones have in common they are different people in the most fundamental sense They have their own identities their own thoughts and their own rights Should you be confused on this point just ask a twin Suppose that Unsolved Mysteries called you with news of a long lost identical twin Would that suddenly make you less of a person less of an individual It is hard to see how So why would a clone be different Your clone would be raised in a different era by different people like the lost identical twin only younger than you A person s basic humanity is not governed by how he or she came into this world or whether somebody else happens to have the same DNA Twins aren t the only clones in everyday life Think about seedless grapes or navel oranges if there are no seeds where did they come from It s the plant equivalent of virgin birth which is to say that they are all clones propagated by cutting a shoot and planting it Wine is almost entirely a cloned product The grapes used for wine have seeds but they ve been cloned from shoots for more than a hundred years in the case of many vineyards The same is true for many flowers Go to a garden store and you ll find products with delightful names like Olivia s Cloning Compound a mix of hormones to dunk on the cut end of a shoot to help it take root One recurring image in anti cloning propaganda is of some evil dictator raising an army of cloned warriors Excuse me but who is going to raise such an army raise in the sense used by parents Clones start out life as babies Armies are far easier to raise the old fashioned way by recruiting or drafting naive young adults Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori has worked well enough to send countless young men to their deaths through the ages Why mess with success Remember that cloning is not the same as genetic engineering We don t get to make superman we have to find him first Maybe we could clone the superwarrior from Congressional Medal of Honor winners Their bravery might or might not be genetically determined But suppose that it is You might end up with such a brave battalion of heroes that when a grenade lands in their midst there is a competition to see who gets to jump on it to save the others Admirable perhaps but not necessarily the way to win a war And what about the supply sergeants The army has a lot more of them than heroes You could try to breed an expert for every job including the petty bureaucrats but what s the point There s not exactly a shortage of them What if Saddam Hussein clones were to rule Iraq for another thousand years Sounds bad but Saddam s natural son Uday is reputed to make his father seem saintly by comparison We have no more to fear from a clone of Saddam or of Hitler than we do from their natural born kin which is to say we don t have much to fear Dictators kids rarely pose a problem Stalin s daughter retired to Arizona and Kim Jong Il of North Korea is laughable as Great Leader Version 2 0 The notion of an 80 year old man cloning himself to cheat death is quaint but it is unrealistic First the baby wouldn t really be him Second is the old duffer really up to changing diapers A persistent octogenarian might convince a younger couple to have his clone and raise it but that is not much different from fathering a child via a surrogate mother Fear of clones is just another form of racism We all agree it is wrong to discriminate against people based on a set of genetic characteristics known as race Calls for a ban on cloning amount to discrimination against people based on another genetic trait the fact that somebody already has an identical DNA sequence The most extreme form of discrimination is genocide seeking to eliminate that which is different In this case the genocide is pre emptive clones are so scary that we must eliminate them before they exist with a ban on their creation What is so special about natural reproduction anyway Cloning is the only predictable way to reproduce because it creates the identical twin of a known adult Sexual reproduction is a crap shoot by comparison some random mix of mom and dad In evolutionary theory this combination is thought to help stir the gene pool so to speak However evolution for humans is essentially over because we use medical science to control the death rate Whatever the temptations of cloning the process of natural reproduction will always remain a lot more fun An expensive and uncomfortable lab procedure will never offer any real competition for sex The people most likely to clone will be those in special circumstances infertile couples who must endure IVF anyway for example Even there many will mix genetics to mimic nature Another special case is where one member of a couple has a severe genetic disease They might choose a clone of the healthy parent rather than burden their child with a joint heritage that could be fatal The most upsetting possibility in human cloning isn t superwarriors or dictators It s that rich people with big egos will clone themselves The common practice of giving a boy the same name as his father or choosing a family name for a child of either sex reflects our hunger for vicarious immortality Clones may resonate with this instinct and cause some people to reproduce this way So what Rich and egotistic folks do all sorts of annoying things and the law is hardly the means with which to try and stop them The deep ethical issues about cloning mainly boil down to jealousy Economic jealousy is bad enough and it is a factor here but the thing that truly drives people crazy is sexual jealousy Eons of evolution through sexual selection have made the average man or woman insanely jealous of any interloper who gains a reproductive advantage say by diddling your spouse Cloning is less personal than cuckoldry but it strikes a similar chord Someone has got the reproductive edge on you Once the fuss has died down and further animal research has paved the way direct human cloning will be one more option among many specialized medical interventions in human reproduction affecting only a tiny fraction of the population Research into this area could bring far wider benefits Clinton s knee jerk policy changes nothing in the short run but it is ultimately a giant step backward In using an adult cell to create a clone the cellular clock that determines the difference between an embryo and adult was somehow reset Work in this area might help elucidate the process by which aging occurs and yield a way to reset the clocks in some of our own cells allowing us to regenerate Selfishly speaking that would be more exciting to me than cloning because it would help me That s a lot more directly useful than letting me sire an identical twin 40 years my junior To some the scientist laboring away to unlock the mysteries of life is a source of evil never to be trusted To others including me the scientist is the ray of light illuminating the processes that make the universe work and making us better through that knowledge Various arguments can be advanced toward either view but one key statistic is squarely on my side The vast majority of people including those who rail against science owe their very lives to previous medical discoveries They embody the fruits of science Don t let the forces of darkness ignorance and fear turn us back from research Instead let us raise and yes even clone new generations of hapless ingrates who can whine and rail against the discoveries of the next age
