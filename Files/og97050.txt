 Office of the General Counsel B 277149 June 12 1997 The Honorable Richard G Lugar Chairman The Honorable Tom Harkin Ranking Minority Member Committee on Agriculture Nutrition and Forestry United States Senate The Honorable Bob Smith Chairman The Honorable Charles W Stenholm Ranking Minority Member Committee on Agriculture House of Representatives Subject Department of Agriculture Commodity Credit Corporation Environmental Quality Incentives Program Pursuant to section 801 a 2 A of title 5 United States Code this is our report on a major rule promulgated by the Department of Agriculture Commodity Credit Corporation CCC entitled Environmental Quality Incentives Program RIN 0578 AA19 We received the rule on May 29 1997 It was published in the Federal Register as a final rule on May 22 1997 62 Fed Reg 28258 Although this rule was promulgated by the Commodity Credit Corporation the organization that funds the Environmental Quality Incentives Program it was filed with us by the Natural Resources Conservation Service the organization whose personnel administer the program The Environmental Quality Incentives Program EQIP is a new conservation program reflecting the functions of four previous programs the Agricultural Conservation Program the Great Plains Conservation Program the Water Quality Incentives Program and the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Program Those programs were repealed as of April 4 1996 However an interim program was instituted between April 4 and October 4 1996 to maintain a basic program until EQIP could begin 16 U S C 3839aa 8 GAO OGC 97 50 According to the Natural Resources Conservation Service this single voluntary program will provide flexible technical financial and educational assistance to farmers and ranchers who face serious threats to soil water and related natural resources on agricultural and other lands including grazing lands wetlands forest lands and wildlife habitats Enclosed is our assessment of the CCC s compliance with the procedural steps required by section 801 a 1 B i through iv of title 5 with respect to the rule Our review indicates that except for ignoring the 60 day delay in the effective date of a major rule required by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 SBREFA the CCC complied with the applicable requirements The preamble to the final rule states that the rule is effective on the date of publication in the Federal Register May 22 1997 because CCC has determined that it is impracticable unnecessary and contrary to the public interest to delay the effective date of the rule The immediate effective date according to the preamble will permit the CCC to offer the public timely reliable information about funding for conservation practices as early as possible before the start of the spring 1997 planting season because it may influence planting decisions Failure to provide the information in a timely manner may mean another year delay in the conservation benefits Finally it stated that the expiration on April 4 1996 of the four former conservation programs and the end of the 180 day authority to administer an interim conservation program on October 4 1996 mean there is no program to provide technical financial and educational assistance to farmers and ranchers SBREFA provides that where an agency for good cause finds that notice and public procedures are impracticable unnecessary or contrary to the public interest the delay provisions of section 801 do not apply 5 U S C 808 2 Here CCC did not make such a finding but published the proposed rule on October 11 1996 in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act It received and considered comments on the proposed rule As discussed in our report on a major rule issued by the Health Care Financing Administration concerning Medicare B 275549 B 275552 December 9 1996 the good cause exception to the 60 day delay provision found at section 808 2 is not available when notice and comment procedures have been used Moreover we note that an effective date of May 22 1997 is in all probability too late to influence spring planting decisions Also the fact that the four former programs expired over a year ago and the temporary authority expired 8 months previously seems to make a further delay of 60 days of small consequence Page 2 GAO OGC 97 50 If you have any questions

AGRICULTURE COMMODITY CREDIT CORPORATION ENTITLED ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY INCENTIVES PROGRAM RIN 0578 AA19 i Cost benefit analysis Because the Office of Management and Budget OMB determined that this was an economically significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 the Natural Resources Conservation Service NRCS conducted an economic analysis of the potential impacts associated with this program NRCS submitted that analysis to the General Accounting Office on May 29 1997 along with a copy of its final rule The analysis estimates that the Environmental Quality Incentives Program EQIP will have a beneficial impact on the adoption of conservation practices and when installed or applied to technical standards will increase net farm income The analysis also estimates that society will benefit from the program in terms of longterm productivity maintenance of the resource base non point source pollution damage reductions and wildlife enhancements NRCS states that because EQIP is a voluntary program it will not impose any obligations or burdens on agricultural producers who choose not to participate NRCS states that the program was authorized at 1 3 billion for the period FY 1996 through FY 2002 with annual amounts of 200 million after the initial interim year of 130 million In the analysis the agency discusses the three alternatives considered in implementing the program i e targeting all the funds to priority areas targeting the majority of the funds to priority areas and targeting the majority of the funds to non priority areas The analysis discusses the beneficial effects and the adverse effects of each alternative and concludes that the second alternative offered the greatest environmental return for the federal dollars spent provided program managers and participants the greatest flexibility in program administration gave effective conservation coverage across the land and involved a large number of participants GAO OGC 97 50 ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 The preamble to the final rule 62 Fed Reg 28258 states that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicable to this rule because the Commodity Credit Corporation CCC which funds this program and has issued this rule is not required by 5 U S C 553 or any other provision of law to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the subject matter of this rule iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C 1532 1535 According to the preamble the rule does not compel the expenditure of 100 million or more by any state local or tribal government or the private sector and therefore a statement under section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Act of 1995 is not required iv Other relevant information or requirements under acts and executive orders Administrative Procedure Act 5 U S C 551 et seq According to CCC this rule is not covered by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act because CCC is not required to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking by that section or any other provision of law Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U S C 3501 3520 CCC states that no substantive changes have been made in this final rule which affect the recordkeeping requirements and estimated burdens previously reviewed and approved under OMB control number 0560 0174 Executive Order l2866 OMB determined that this rule was an economically significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 because it could result in an annual effect on the economy of 100 million or more Pursuant to the order NRCS conducted an economic analysis as discussed above The NRCS economic analysis is discussed in the preamble to the final rule 62 Fed Reg 28258 NRCS provided a full copy of the analysis to us when it filed its copy of the final rule on May 29 1997 Executive Order 12998 The agency reviewed this rule under Executive Order 12998 Civil Justice Reform and determined that the provisions of the final rule are not retroactive and that they Page 2 GAO OGC 97 50 preempt state and local laws to the extent such laws are inconsistent with this rule Before any legal action is brought against this rule in federal court the administrative appeal rights set forth at 7 C F R parts 11 and 614 must be exhausted Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 Pub L No 103 354 The Department of Agriculture classified this rule as a major rule pursuant to section 304 of the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 since it had an annual economic impact on the economy of at least 100 million and it also affected human health and safety or the environment Because of this classification NRCS staff in cooperation with Agriculture s Office of Risk Assessment and Cost Benefit Analysis prepared an environmental risk assessment for EQIP The major conclusion of this assessment is that agricultural production activities in the absence of conservation techniques and practices can have serious environmental impacts The assessment concluded that the best solutions to address risks to environmentally stressed resources are conservation measures applied in concerted concentrated efforts in priority areas with smaller scale efforts going to sectors outside priority areas National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 42 U S C 4321 et seq In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 as amended NRCS staff developed an environmental assessment of this rule to determine if implementation would have a significant impact on the human environment NRCS concluded that it would not and the Chief of NRCS issued a finding of no significant impact on May 20 1997 NRCS provided us with a complete copy of the Environmental Assessment and the Finding of No Significant Impact Statutory authorization for the rule CCC cites as authority for this rule 15
