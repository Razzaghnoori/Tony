 What to Do S ome people visit Budapest to pursue a special interest and happily spend their holiday in thermal pools amidst ancient Roman remains For the less single minded there is a wide range of activities from high culture to late night bars and from sports to folk dancing Some visitors especially those who have been here before may want to experience Budapest as a native by visiting one of the smaller steam baths used by the locals horse riding on the puszta plain or bargaining for old Soviet memorabilia at the ea market Shopping Not very long ago a fistful of dollars would have given you the freedom of most Budapest shopping streets The end of communism the imposition of VAT at 16 percent and the effect of in ation have however brought an end to those bargain basement days As ever artisans provide the bulk of the best buys but it is worth bearing in mind that their hand produced items can t compete with the price of the mass produced substitutes from the Far East If something is extremely cheap chances are that it s a clever imitation Where to Shop The former Intourist shops which only took HUFand had a virtual monopoly on quality souvenirs have been consigned to the same scrap heap as the statues of Stalin You can now buy most Western goods in the city s department stores at any number of specialist shops and on market stalls in fact at all the usual retail outlets

factory has been turning out porcelain for the tables of the nobility since 1826 members of the British royal family from Queen Victoria to Charles and Diana have been customers As everything is still hand nished prices are understandably high You don t need to travel all the way to Herend to buy Herend ceramics as there is a specialist shop on J zsef N dor t r behind the Gerbeaud caf on V r smarty

Sports For a relatively small nation Hungary has enjoyed much Olympic and World Championship success During the mid 1950s its football team was one of the nest in the world For the most part national sport was for the favoured few and pursued to promote the cause of communism Despite this Hungary still offers spectators and participants a busy world of sports There may be no sea but Lake Balaton does offer a playground for watersports fans Horse riders won t be disappointed either the Hungarians have been known for their equestrian prowess ever since the Magyars swept over the Great Plain Taking Part Billiards and bowling Billiards which also includes ten pin bowling snooker and pool is a very popular pastime in Budapest For a list of venues ask Tourinform or see the Sports and Leisure

ski pull at Balatonf red and you can jet ski on the Danube near Szentendre island with Jets Sport look for the signposts near the Hotel Party on Highway 11 Spectating The major event of the year is the annual Formula 1 Grand Prix meeting at the Hungaroring about 19 km 12 miles east of town see page 91 Other important sports events are held at the N pstadion complex a short distance to the east of the centre Every week the locals enjoy football and horse racing the former is Hungary s most popular spectator sport Two of the more popular of Budapest s first division football teams are currently Kispest Honv d and Ferencv ros Be aware that the latter has a thuggish minority among its supporters The L verseny t r stadium at Kerepesi t 11 is the main venue for horse racing and attracts a large audience The at race galopp season is in summer meetings take place on Sundays and Thursdays Trotting harness racing meetings are held all year round on Wednesdays and Saturdays at a smaller stadium also on Kerepesi t closer to the city centre Details of sporting events are printed in the foreign language listings magazines or newspapers see page 118 The Style section of the Budapest Sun is particularly good Entertainment Budapest has a very active nightlife as a glance through any of the newspaper listings sections will con rm The city is best known for what Westerners would regard as highbrow culture theatre opera ballet and particularly classical concerts In Budapest tickets are much more democratically priced than in the West and there is less of a class distinction amongst the audiences Standard popular culture is also prevalent ranging from a bland Parisian style cabaret to much raunchier girly shows Big name international music and showbiz acts also regularly call in at Budapest from Jean Michel Jarre to the Chippendales High rollers may like to note that Budapest is eagerly embracing casinos Performing Arts Theatrical life is very active on average several new productions give premi res in Hungary each week The city has a number of ne theatres sz nh z of which the Vigad is probably number one However except for the English language Merlin Theatre on Gerl czy utca tel 117 9338 all plays are staged in Hungarian thus excluding most of the foreign tourists The language barrier is of course much less problematic with opera ballet and dance or music The State Opera House on Andr ssy t is the nest of the city s dedicated opera venues the Vigad also produces opera and connoisseurs rank it among Europe s best Ballet is performed at the Erkel Theatre K zt rsas g t r which also stages opera and at the Nemzeti Sz nh z National Theatre on Hevesi S ndor t r In August the Budafest is a spectacular celebration of opera and ballet in the State Opera House The main classical music venues are in Pest the Academy of Music Liszt Ferenc t r and the Basilica and the B la Bart k Memorial House Csal n t 29 venues in Buda include the Matthias Church and the Museum of Music History During the summer open air performances are staged under the stars on Margaret Island or before authentic ancient backdrops in castle courtyards Tickets are available centrally for the concert performances go to the of ce at V r smarty t r 1 for opera go to Andr ssy t 18 Larger hotels will also make bookings for you or you can simply go direct to the venue box of ce Tourinform also sells some concert tickets The most comprehensive listings are given by the publication Pesti Musor and Koncert Kalend rium Hungarian language only A good free publication is Pesti Est available at box offices hotels and restaurants Musicals from Broadway and London s West End like Cats Les Mis rables etc can be enjoyed in Budapest as long as you don t mind a little Hungarian in between the songs Tickets are on sale at the Andr ssy t booking of ce For pop rock and jazz concerts the best listing is the monthly publication Budapest Panorama this also gives a good round up of bars pubs and clubs in the city Go to the Music Mix shop at V ci utca 33 for tickets Clubs and Bars Hungary s late night drinking and partying scene is not much different from that in other international cities The Pubs are based either on the English model or more commonly the German bierstube There is also a variety of international bars Continental style caf s and authentic Hungarian bars though the latter are not very apparent in the main tourist areas Look for the sign s r zo if you are a beer drinker and boroz if you prefer wine While a s r zo is often similar to a German bierstube however a boroz is rarely like a Parisian wine bar and neither serves only beer or wine Live music is quite common with jazz suppressed as subversive in the Stalinist era currently enjoying something of a renaissance in Budapest nightspots Most performances are blues and dixieland and audiences are generally young There are also several cabaret clubs presenting oorshows with big production numbers and scantily clad dancers For visitors who prefer the excitement of the casino Hungary has 23 gambling establishments The place to be seen is the Hilton Hotel which in common with most Budapest casinos offers French and American roulette blackjack poker punto banco baccarat and to clear you of loose change and give you a bit of exercise slot machines There are many other city casinos the Las Vegas in the Atrium Hyatt the Gresham in the Gresham Building Roosevelt t r the Sch nbrun casino ship by the Chain Bridge the Orfeum in the Hotel B ke the Vigad on Vigad utca and the V rkert on the Buda embankment at the southern tip of Castle Hill The latter is housed in a beautiful neo Renaissance building by Mikl s Ybl designer of the Opera House Casinos generally open from 4 00 p m to 3 00 or 4 00 a m Films Hungarians take their movies seriously and Hungarian directors have come up with lastingly interesting works But the tourist is out of luck because the domestic product is incomprehensible even locally and most of the foreign films are dubbed into Hungarian Folklore Despite a recent cultural invasion from the West Hungary still has a very active folk music scene and where there is music dancing is never very far behind Hungarian folk dancing is well worth watching and takes you through the whole gamut of courtly wedding dances to high energy boot slapping Lad s Dances from the 18th century As ever it s best to catch it at local festivals where performers are there for the love of dancing or local pride as opposed to the tourist dollar In the same vein look out for the real gypsy dancers who have vivacity associated with the likes of Andalucian amenco performers You can see Hungarian dancers amateur or professional most nights at the Municipal Folklore Centre at Feh rv ri t 47 south of Gell rt Hill Folklore evenings are also staged at other venues the Hungarian State Folk Ensemble gives excellent performances Folklore evenings of a different type are also touted by some restaurants These are generally staged for tour groups on whistle stop visits and while they provide an easy option they are not representative of real Hungarian folk entertainment Children The main roads of Budapest and particularly Pest are busy with people and traf c and children have to be closely watched Many other areas in the city and the surrounding region however are much more suitable for them The obvious place to go is the City Park where the zoo and Vid m Park are within a few yards of each other and the circus makes regular appearances The zoo as well as the amusement park are more traditional than modern but the circus is reputedly one of Europe s best If the weather is warm the splendid Sz chenyi Baths is the perfect place for cooling off In summer there s a boating lake in the park and in winter this converts to an ice skating rink The other oasis in the city is Margaret Island You can spend a good hour or so riding round it en famille on a bicycle carriage made for four You can also swim here in the city s biggest baths the Palatinus Strand Children also seem to enjoy the open air wave pool at the Gell rt Hotel Out of town Lake Balaton is a good place for water babies particularly the southern edge where the sandy shore slopes gently into warm water A cog wheel railway and a small gauge train takes you to the peaceful Buda hills the latter is staffed almost entirely by children apart from the driver see page 41 The chairlift is a great favourite It s a good idea to take along a picnic Older children with an interest in horses may enjoy a day at a riding school see page 82 or one of the tour operators organized horse shows Details are available from IBUSZ or Tourinform Nightlife possibilities include folkdancing see page 88 or a not so traditional laser show at the Planetarium in the N pliget to the southeast of the city centre For more useful ideas look in the bookshops for Budapest for Children by Bob Dent If
