 Advertising for Dummies One of the more remarked upon trends in modern actually postmodern I guess advertising is the reliance upon anti ads those commercials that acknowledge the basic insincerity of the adman s project and which presumably please viewers by nudge nudge wink winking them in a way that recognizes how phenomenally aware we are of advertising s attempts to ensnare us Sprite s Thirst Is Everything campaign with its faux pop songs touting the drink s magical powers is the most obvious example and some days it feels as if we re all living in the world The Monkees made The past few months though have given us an entirely new and relatively unremarked upon advertising trend which might be called the consumers are dumb as a post phenomenon The campaign for AT T s Single One Rate plan thus features Paul Reiser going around talking to people about how now every long distance call they make with AT T will cost just 7 cents a minute while those he talks to react with a mix of befuddlement and incredulity peppering him with questions that show that they just don t get what 7 cents a minute really means Similarly Burger King s new radio campaign for its Cini Minis centers on an announcer trying to explain that Cini Minis cost just 99 cents to a group of people who ask questions like If I had 17 cents could I get a Cini Mini And Merrill Lynch s utterly bizarre television ads for its new pricing structure Internet strategy all feature Merrill customers who just can t quite understand what this whole newfangled approach is going to mean like the guy who tells his broker how much he ll miss her even as she assures him that she ll still be around The Merrill campaign is by far the strangest exemplar of the trend since what the ads which include one in which confused customers quiz a panel of Merrill execs at a kind of town meeting actually point out is both how dubious the whole brokerage business was to begin with and how potentially damaging the new pricing structure which includes much lower commissions will be to Merrill s bottom line But the principle in all these campaigns is the same The company is offering something incredibly simple and straightforward but consumers just can t see it I think it makes sense to ask whether people really like being told how obtuse they are because even if the ads work on some level to inculcate a sense of superiority in the viewer as in These idiots don t know what 7 cents a minute every day means but I sure do Ha ha ha on a deeper level we are the people Reiser and those Merrill guys are talking to and think of how troubling it is to be told that Paul Reiser understands something you don t So this aspect of the ads is genuinely perplexing Usually aspirational advertising doesn t include not being stupid as one of the aspirations it s meant to inspire But there is something else going on in these ads which is that they re essentially a kind of reaction against data smog The people in these ads have been confused by complicated pricing plans and service agreements with strange restrictions They ve been trained to think that everything will be difficult and tricky They re unable to see the purity of 7 cents a minute even when it s right in front of them And in some way the ads are saying that simplicity is disorienting because we re too comfortable with complexity It s like Morning in America all over again The problem is that this message is so simple that you can only hear it a couple of times before it becomes intolerable I m happy to watch ads that remind me of my knowingness if they re clever But there s no way to do the It s so simple it s baffling ads cleverly because the whole point of the ads is that cleverness itself is bad This is partly why the Merrill ads which seem to want to be clever end up seeming weirdly self defeating And that would seem to mean that this trend will be short lived Then again Touched by an Angel is a Top 10 show So who knows
