 have you had to put anyone in a nursing home no but my husband s mother was in a nursing home um and she was in there she got sick and they put her in a nursing home because you couldn t we couldn t afford a nurse to you know all all day nurse yeah twenty four hours yeah well at least as they told us uh two shifts oh you know that s sixteen hours because one would come in the morning and one would be at night i mean in the afternoon and then that night it wouldn t need one yeah yeah you know because she would be sleeping so i would be here then yeah that would seem like that would be uh more expensive than a uh nursing nursing home wouldn t it well the nursing home is covered by uh social security see oh and the nurse at home isn t oh okay i got you and the nurses aren t no see you have to pay that yeah i didn t know that and oh yeah if you put nursing home and that s another thing i you know you got to find a good nursing home is very hard to find because the people don t care most of them don t care some of them do care the work that you know the the nurse aide that what the problem is i think it s the nurses aide they don t pay them enough to keep them there and to do the things that they need to do now well my brother in law was working with uh in one for a little bit and uh he just he couldn t handle the things he had to do uh huh you know uh cleaning up after men uh men and women using the restroom and stuff he he he couldn t handle it oh yeah it s gets bad some of them and then it depends on the nursing home and how bad it is you know because they have some nursing home that don t have anybody that s not walking you know yeah and it just depends on how bad that person is well seems to me if a person gets into that area they i i don t know it seems like if you re going to get in that area and spend the time learning it because you do have to go to school on some of it yeah uh you ought to do your job yeah and um and if you can t if you can t i think they should get out of it instead of mistreating the people yeah i i ve heard a lot of bad things about them mistreating people and uh well i ve even heard of some people being sexually abused they steal yeah that and they steal yeah they steal from them uh oh yeah i used to take uh every week you know i have to threaten it which it doesn t make sense for me to have to sit there and threaten uh people um that work there i didn t yeah you know like i bring her i bought her a blanket and i had this girl hand crocheted her a lap blanket you know because she sits in a wheel chair but she can walk they just sit them in wheel chairs and i told her uh i came up there the following week and it was gone i said where is it she said in the washer i said i tell you what when i come back it better be here because they went to the washer we didn t find it i said you all better find it yeah and you know bedspread her bedspread she i took her a bedspread because she a comforter because she was always cold yeah and so uh you know then i had to put write the name on the whole bedspread i m talking uh like it s in each square it almost you know on both sides so that they can t turn it over and put it on somebody else s bed all over that s that s not right huh uh i ve i ve only known two people in a nursing home and you know it was my grandmother and grandfather on my father s side and i just heard through my father what was going on and uh yeah well see this this one i i is more or less first hand you know she just died um we buried her February but she had been in there at least i know for seven years eight years and he didn t want to put her in there but he can t afford it yeah and that s another thing you know yeah something i guess you get forced to do make decisions and but you don t have it depends on when didn t you you have a choice the only thing i can say is you have a choice of where they go sometimes yeah sometimes you don t and then you have to check out the nursing home and the only way you re going to check out a nursing home is to actually put them in there and check on them every time but don t tell the people what time you going to come in just come in uh yeah you have to do one of them you know spontaneous things like maybe three o clock in the afternoon or one o clock in the afternoon and stuff like that because they re not expecting you yeah yeah you know they expect you Saturday like on Saturdays Friday you know Saturdays and Sundays and Friday and stuff but not during the week yeah hum um it gets bad it is nursing home i think is sometimes i think some people put them in there and then they just die that s about what it s for and it s really not some people don t need to be in there you know that s what i ve heard too you know i heard that they just put them in there because they don t want to mess with them that s right and i don t think that s right i think they should have a place to some of the people that don t need to be in the nursing home with nurses they need to have a place for them like a retirement home well yeah i ve heard uh some things you know uh i i don t where i heard it from it might have been a movie or something where they made a apartment complex into a what you re saying for people who can take care of themselves but they they uh need a little help in doing it yeah don t yeah and see that would be okay you could have somebody check on each one of them every day you know go by and see what they need yeah each of them have their own little apartment or little little place to live you know even just a little room or whatever yeah well do they share rooms in nursing homes sometimes yeah it depends on the patient and and i guess sometimes the availability of that of the room and how they done built the hospitals because i know one lady like she had a roommate but the woman across the hall didn t have one um get my purse uh but it it it you know it just to me nursing homes are um bad news bad news unless you can find a really good one and those are rare but there are some good ones and there are some bad ones i mean well i ll i ll say something i said in the last conversation i hope i m never in that position where i have to be put in one uh from all i ve heard about it just not and i ve heard i told my husband well is this weird because see what people don t understand is even the people that work in the nursing home they will get old one day yeah and everything that they do to somebody will come back to them that s the way i feel yeah well if it ain t uh well you know uh or maybe that won t not make it that far in life for what they did to somebody but well yeah i have my beliefs in the hereafter and i believe that uh God will take care of them that s the whole that s what i think i think God will definitely get uh you know uh there s two people that i know you should not mess uh abuse and that s a child and a someone person that s elderly you shouldn t abuse anybody but but down right true them people them two people are the most helpless people you see what i m saying yeah you know they can t really defend themselves like somebody grown uh say my age you know yeah or mine yeah i got you there because i can tell somebody to go leave me alone but they so old or you can force them to do it if you know yeah you can force their hand more or less but see somebody that old they don t know yeah uh and then what they what are they going to do and if they tell anybody people always say oh they re just senile you know huh uh and that ain t right neither no it s not so it it it gets bad you know it just depends on like i said the nursing home now my grandmother was in a nursing home in California before she died but it was a nice nursing home for you know it was one of the nice ones yeah but now my mom and them had to pay for that too yeah i was going to say you have to pay something like three and four times more you have to pay more you know social security covers so much and then um you have to pay some more and she chose to pay some more well if she you know since it was like my my grandmother had thirteen kids so they all you know paid their month which was better but see my husband s a only child yeah and then he d have to pay it all yeah yeah i know what big families are like and how they can get together if you if they re really cooperative and wanting the best if yeah see and then there s another thing she told me is you have to make sure everybody cooperates because like by her her being there if someone if one of her brothers didn t send in their check she would have to pay it yeah you know and wait for him to whenever he decide to pay it you know yeah well i know my mom from a family of at least sixteen i ve lost count uh and my grandmother just died sometime last well about two years ago um hum um hum and uh they was all talking about pulling together and paying for the uh hospital costs and stuff and uh you know there s some of my family that s not exactly in the homeless level but you know darn close yeah yeah and uh then there s others who is uh huh lots better off just pretty oh yeah see that s what that s what gets me like well just like my brother he has got his five bedroom house and in California with the swimming pool and here i am renting a house barely making it you know well in California too i ve got a friend that lives out there and uh she s got a little two three bedroom house with a garage a double car garage and it s costing her a thousand dollars a month um hum California is high yeah and then you know it s like i tell him you make more money than i do than i could ever really think about if i made as much money as my brother i would be just like set for life that s what we keep saying you know but not him he s never happy and i think that s that s why he makes as much as he do is because he keeps thriving for more uh well that s which i probably if i got what i wanted i d be okay you know well that s a good initiative uh i guess if but
