 Weatherbox Call i This i a Blizzard Click here to read about the snow shenanigans of our diarist Walter Shapiro Among the duties of this column is to put weather events that cause momentary media alarm into historical perspective See last summer s heat wave inspired Weatherbox and Weatherbox Part II Yesterday a fast developing storm hit almost the entire eastern seaboard leaving cities towns farms and mountains from Georgia to Massachusetts blanketed with the heaviest snowfall since a blizzard four years ago according to today s Washington Post Chatterbox who lives in D C a place that s routinely paralyzed by snow flurries isn t denying that the snowstorm was disruptive It was even more impressive in Raleigh N C where the 20 inches of snow that fell set a local record As usual however Chatterbox feels impatient with the provincialism of local records and asks What s the most snow that s ever fallen anywhere This data isn t as easy to keep track of as temperature extremes partly because snow melts and drifts and does all sorts of other things that make it difficult to measure and partly because the world s extreme snowfalls tend to occur at very high elevations where there aren t a lot of climatologists hanging around However Mount Baker in Washington state appears to have been certified by the Commerce Department s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as setting a record last year for the most snowfall ever measured in the United States Chatterbox presumes that means the continental United States in a single season This occurred during the snowfall season that stretched from autumn 1998 through spring 1999 The snowfall amount was 1 140 inches of snow The previous record was 1 122 inches which fell on Mount Rainier Wash in the 1971 72 season Fully 36 inches fell on Mount Baker on Dec 2 1998 During the months of January and February 1999 there were only eight days when it didn t snow It even snowed a couple of inches on June 5 1999 Now that s a lot of snow This information must of course be placed in context In most places heavy snowfalls are considered a troublesome albeit picturesque natural phenomenon In places that depend heavily on revenues from ski resorts like Mount Baker heavy snowfalls are considered manna from heaven Chatterbox doesn t mean to suggest for a minute that the misery of Durham N C when it snows there is in any way preferable to the jubilation in Mount Baker Wash Moreover the very fact that Mount Baker is a place where people pray for heavy snowfalls makes it likelier that the locals will collect potentially record setting data more energetically than people in other places Surely this skews the data even assuming Mount Baker is scrupulously honest in its record keeping Nonetheless The quantity of snow that fell on the eastern seaboard this week was a pittance compared with the quantity that fell last season on Mount Baker
