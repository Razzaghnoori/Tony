 Bound in Chains In November 1994 an e mail letter began to circulate on the Internet detailing the dangers of a vicious hard drive eating computer virus called Good Times Recipients were urged to forward the e mail to their friends Computer authorities promptly debunked the letter the virus did not exist Soon a revamped Good Times message appeared on the Net warning of an n th complexity infinite binary loop a device as fictional as it is impressive sounding Even though this note was debunked it continued to propagate as well intentioned computer users forwarded it to their friends and colleagues Netizens translated it into other languages and it appeared around the world It was read over a radio broadcast in Malta Eventually a parody arrived it too was widely circulated According to the Good Times FAQ Web page It s no longer accurate to speak of comebacks and outbreaks of Good Times It s just there part of the landscape like kudzu and dandelions Of course chain letters like the Good Times e mail predate the Internet In the 19 th century prayer chains encouraged the faithful to pray for someone in need and extend the chain A well known postal chain the St Jude letter claims a 1903 inception date It promises luck to those who forward it and calamity to those who don t The U S Postal Service estimates that the chain has circled the globe at least nine times Prayer chains also thrive on the telephone as callers dial friends and acquaintances and ask them to pray for someone in need and then ask them to make the same request of their friends and acquaintances The St Jude letter is a mind virus says Oliver Goodenough of Vermont Law School Goodenough and Richard Dawkins the noted Darwinist have written about the survival techniques of the St Jude letter and other chain mail for the scientific journal Nature In their view these information parasites seek to infect host brains The most fit mind virus is the one that is forwarded replicated to prospective infectees Less fit letters are not forwarded and so die Some potential hosts are inoculated against chain mail viruses by excessive exposure they simply ignore the letters In the old days there were measurable costs to extending the chain time consuming hand copying or expensive photocopying or the price of postage But thanks to virtually free e mail the velocity of chain mail has accelerated on the Net and successful chains now billow into huge tumorous entities in a matter of weeks The Good Times e mail cribs its evolutionary strategy from the old postal chains A Utah man received this letter and threw it away Nine days later he died By invoking fear and disaster the Good Times e mail finds a soft spot to infect Anxiety about a hard disk crash is never far from computer users minds Greed is almost as good a parasitic strategy as fear The ubiquitous Make Money Fast e mail recasts the classic pyramid scheme as e scam Send 5 to the names on the list add your own name to the bottom and reap your windfall later The MMF Hall of Humiliation Web site traces the Make Money Fast chains to their origins and lists addresses and phones of the alleged originators requesting that you spam them Pitted against the evolutionary strategies of fear and greed we find a genre of chain e mail that employs compassion Surely you ve received the Jessica Mydek letter birthed on America Online It reads LITTLE JESSICA MYDEK IS SEVEN YEARS OLD AND IS SUFFERING FROM AN ACUTE AND VERY RARE CASE OF CEREBRAL CARCINOMA THIS CONDITION CAUSES SEVERE MALIGNANT BRAIN TUMORS AND IS A TERMINAL ILLNESS THE DOCTORS HAVE GIVEN HER SIX MONTHS TO LIVE AS PART OF HER DYING WISH SHE WANTED TO START A CHAIN LETTER TO INFORM PEOPLE OF THIS CONDITION AND TO SEND PEOPLE THE MESSAGE TO LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST AND ENJOY EVERY MOMENT A CHANCE THAT SHE WILL NEVER HAVE FURTHERMORE THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY AND SEVERAL CORPORATE SPONSORS HAVE AGREED TO DONATE THREE CENTS TOWARD CONTINUING CANCER RESEARCH FOR EVERY NEW PERSON THAT GETS FORWARDED THIS MESSAGE PLEASE GIVE JESSICA AND ALL CANCER VICTIMS A CHANCE It is a beautiful vision A dying girl spreads a noble message across the world All readers need to do to fill cancer research coffers is click a button The one problem of course is that Jessica Mydek is as fictitious as an n th complexity infinite binary loop The American Cancer Society disavows any involvement with the letter The Jessica Mydek e mail succeeds because it promises the replicator instant karma So does the Save NPR letter which claims that public broadcasting is in peril Its modest request is that recipients put their names at the bottom of the list and forward it to friends Eventually the letter states the e mail petition will be collected and presented to Congress and the president Never mind of course that public broadcasting isn t under attack that NPR receives little of its support directly from Congress and that NPR spokespeople say the letter is useless Web sites that campaign against chain mail complain that junk e mail wastes Internet bandwidth reduces productivity and exploits human emotions But let s not forget the upside to the chains They make you feel as if the click of your mouse has saved your neighbor s hard drive healed sickly Jessica Mydek and rescued poor little NPR Jessica Mydek may not be real but the emotion showered on her is and the millions of e mails containing her name suggest that the impulse to do good on the Net could be harnessed Craig Shergold was a genuine Jessica Mydek a 7 year old with cancer In 1989 he began a conventional postal chain letter asking that greeting cards be mailed to Atlanta s Children s Wish Foundation his goal was to break the Guinness World Record He did it in two years receiving 16 million cards and his cancer went into permanent remission Then the chain moved to the Internet and people continued to send cards even though Craig asked them not to By 1993 he was clearing 300 000 cards a week and stopped counting at 60 million total cards The foundation needed a donated warehouse and 40 full time staff to handle the mail which it simply recycled Last month I got a chain e mail requesting greeting cards for Craig Shergold I forwarded it to 10 friends
