 Introduction As many as 30 of patients with breast cancer who have undergone curative surgery and show no evidence of locoregional or distant disease still have recurrent disease over 5 10 years 1 2 Some of these treatment failures may be attributed to residual disease in the breast or axillary lymph nodes 3 The limitation of routine histopathologic examination of the tumor margins and the dissected lymph node specimen is well known 4 Contemporary methods of detection including computed tomography magnetic resonance imaging bone scintigraphy and flow cytometry all have limited sensitivity and specificity 5 6 Micrometastases can be found by immunohistochemistry or polymerase chain reaction in 10 30 of the patients previously deemed free of disease by conventional histological methods 7 8 The prognostic importance of micrometastases found with these sensitive methods are now being evaluated 9 10 11 Hepatocyte growth factor scatter factor HGF SF is a paracrine factor produced primarily by mesenchymal cells HGF SF induces mitogenic and morphogenic changes including rapid membrane ruffling formation of microspikes and increased cellular motility 12 13 The diverse biological effects of HGF SF are all mediated by Met which is preferentially expressed on epithelial cells 14 In vivo this receptor ligand pair is essential for normal embryonic development 15 16 Whereas Met signaling clearly has a role in normal cellular processes this signaling pathway has also been implicated in tumor development and progression Met signaling can increase tumorigenicity induce cell motility and enhance invasiveness in vitro and metastasis in vivo 14 17 18 19 20 In addition Met signaling can increase the production of protease and urokinase which are associated with extracellular matrix basal membrane degradation and are important for metastasis 14 19 Operations for breast cancer include either mastectomy or breast conserving surgery consisting of wide local excision of the tumor with margins of intact breast tissue lumpectomy and axillary lymph node dissection Drains are inserted in the dissected axilla in most of these operations to avoid the accumulation of lymphatic fluid The goals of this study were to examine whether Met can be detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RT PCR in the axillary drainage from patients who have undergone conservative operations for breast cancer and to assess the correlations between the mRNA expression of Met in the collected fluid and prognostic factors of breast cancer Materials and methods Patients and operations Thirty one consecutive women with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast who were suitable for breast conserving treatment were studied We included only patients who underwent conserving breast surgery so that we could evaluate the correlations of Met HGF SF expression with both the tumor margins and the status of the axillary lymph nodes The diagnosis of cancer was established by needle core biopsy Trucut which was performed 2 weeks before the operation All patients underwent wide local excision and axillary lymph node dissection by the same team Non palpable tumors were localized by mammography before surgery by wire insertion During operations a wide resection around the wire was performed followed by mammographic confirmation of complete resection of the tumors The axillary dissection was performed with a separate incision and level I and II axillary lymph nodes were removed The breast incisions were closed without drainage and all axillae were drained postoperatively by closed vacuum drains ch 14 Biometrix The output of the drain was collected and measured every 24 hours the drains were removed when the output was less than 25 ml per 24 h The presence of Met HGF SF and actin were assessed in the fluid which was collected during the second postoperative day because during the first 24 hours it might contain many erythrocytes and debris Pathological examinations The resected specimen was covered circumferentially by black Indian ink and Bouins solution and then was sliced into 5 mm slices Each slice was evaluated macroscopically for the presence of tumor and its distance from the margins of the specimen All slices involved with tumor were paraffin embedded sliced again into 4 m slides and stained with hematoxylin eosin Microscopical evaluation was performed by one pathologist for margin involvement tumor type size grade capillary or lymphatic invasion and the distance from the margins All axillary lymph nodes were paraffin embedded sliced into 4 m slides and assessed for the presence of micrometastases Receptor assays Estrogen receptor ER and progesterone receptor PR were assessed in the tumor by immunohistochemical assay with mouse monoclonal antibodies NCL ER 6F11 and NCL PGR 312 in accordance with the manufacturer s instruction Novocastra Laboratories We used the quick score a simple combination of the proportion of cells staining plus a measure of intensity of staining 21 A cut off value of 2 or more was taken as negative for ER or PR RT PCR assays Total RNA was extracted from axillary lymphatic fluid with the Tri Reagent procedure in accordance with the manufacturer s instruction Sigma Reverse transcription was performed with 1 2 g of total RNA The first strand of cDNA was generated with 0 5 g of dT 15 primer Gibco BRL using 200 units of subscripts II RNAse H reverse transcriptase Gibco BRL This was incubated for 50 min at 42 C followed by inactivation for 15 min at 70 C To detect Met transcript PCR was performed on 3 l of cDNA with MP1 primer 5 GGAATCGAGCTGCGAGA 3 and MP2 primer 5 TCCAACATGCAGTTTCTTGC 3 To detect actin transcript PCR was performed on 3 l of cDNA with MP1 primer 5 CTCTTCCAGCCTTCCTTCCT 3 and MP2 primer 5 AGCACTGTGTTGGCGTACAG 3 Cycling conditions consisted of 35 cycles with denaturation steps at 94 C for 30 s hybridization steps at 55 C for 30 s and an extension step at 72 C for 1 min The actin and c Met RT PCRs were performed simultaneously under the same conditions The limit of sensitivity of the RT PCR system for Met was 1 pg of total RNA Immunohistochemical analyses Staining was performed with an antibody against hepatocyte growth factor receptor HGF R H 145 Santa Cruz Biotechnology Santa Cruz California USA Sections 5 m mounted on Super Frost plus glass Menzel and Claser both in Braunschweig Germany were processed by a labelled streptavidin biotin method with a Histostain Plus kit Zymed San Francisco California USA Heat induced antigen retrieval was performed by temperature controlled microwave treatment with an H2800 model processor Energy Beam Sciences Inc Agawan Massachusetts USA for 12 min in 10 mM citrate buffer pH 6 0 at 97 C The sections were treated for 5 min with 3 H 2 O 2 followed by a 10 min incubation with the universal blocker Cas block Zymed The sections were incubated for 32 min with 1 20 diluted HGF R antibody A biotinylated second antibody was applied for 10 min followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase conjugated streptavidin for 10 min The slides were washed with Optimax wash buffer BioGenex San Ramon California USA after each incubation The immunoreaction was revealed by a horseradish peroxidase based chromogen The sections were then counterstained and cleared in xylene Controlled staining was performed with human liver tissue The presence of brown diaminobenzidine staining of the cell membranes of tumor cells was interpreted as positive reactivity Control group To verify that in normal persons there is no Met in the axilla we examined the axillary drainage in 20 patients with malignant melanoma who were found to have negative axillary sentinel lymph node The lesions were located in the upper limbs and the lymph node basins were found to be in the axilla Sentinel lymph nodes were found in all these patients and none was involved with melanoma in frozen sections or in paraffin embedded and stained slices Statistical evaluation Correlations between the various clinicopathological parameters and RT PCR assays in lymphatic fluid were analyzed by the 2test P 0 05 Results Thirty one consecutive female patients who underwent breast conserving surgery for operable invasive duct carcinoma of the breast between 1 January and 30 June 2000 were included Patients with tumors that invaded the chest wall or skin or with inflammatory carcinoma were excluded The mean age was 58 16 years Twenty three patients 74 2 underwent lumpectomy for palpable masses and in eight women 25 8 wire guided excision of non palpable tumors was performed The tumor size was 0 1 cm in 10 women 32 2 1 2 cm in 9 29 0 2 5 cm in 11 35 4 and larger than 5 cm in 1 3 2 Four patients 12 9 had grade I tumors 19 61 3 had grade II lesions and grade III tumors were found in 8 25 8 Lymphatic and capillary invasion were noted in 10 32 2 and 11 35 4 patients respectively While attempting to achieve free margins five patients 16 1 had to undergo re excision owing to incomplete resections Two of these patients had wire guided excisions The collected axillary fluids were assessed by RT PCR for Met and actin The actin RT PCR served as positive control and gave strong signals in all cases indicating that both RNA preparation and cDNA synthesis were successful The RT PCR assays were positive for Met in 23 74 2 of the breast cancer patients Fig 1 In all of the patients in the control group RT PCR gave positive results for actin but was negative for Met The correlations between tumor size and the presence of Met in the axillary fluid are shown in Table 1 Positive RT PCR assays for Met in the lymphatic fluids were associated with increasing tumor size Eleven of 19 patients 57 9 with T1 tumors tumor size 0 2 cm had positive Met in the axillary fluid 50 and 66 for tumors 0 1 and 1 2 cm in size respectively compared with 12 of 12 patients 100 with T2 and T3 tumors P 0 01 The average number SD of axillary lymph nodes was 17 4 and all dissected nodes were examined for the presence of metastases Twelve patients 38 7 had axillary lymph node metastases as revealed by hematoxylin eosin staining The correlation between metastatic axillary lymph node involvement and the presence of Met in the lymphatic fluid is shown in Table 2 All 12 patients with axillary lymph node metastases had positive RT PCR assays for Met compared with 57 9 11 of 19 positive assays for women without lymph node metastases P 0 01 All five patients with tumor involvement in the margins of the resection had positive RT PCR assays for Met in their lymphatic fluid compared with 18 of 26 positive assays 69 2 for patients without involved margins P 0 04 The associations between tumor grade capillary and lymphatic invasion and the presence of Met in the axillary fluid are presented in Table 3 Patients with lymphatic invasion of the tumor were all Met positive 10 of 10 and patients without lymphatic invasion had 61 9 13 of 21 positive assays for Met P 0 02 Capillary invasion of the tumor was also found to be in correlation with Met although all 11 patients with capillary invasion had positive RT PCR assays for Met in their axillary fluid the assays were positive in only 60 12 of 20 patients without capillary invasion P 0 02 The presence of Met in the axillary drainage was also correlated with higher tumor grade it was found in 50 of grade I tumors compared with 87 5 of grade III lesions P 0 05 The correlations between the ER and PR status and RT PCR assays for Met in the axillary fluid are shown in Table 4 Seventeen patients had ER negative tumors and 16 94 1 of these had Met positive assays in the axillary fluid In seven 87 5 of the eight patients with Met negative assays the ER were positive Similarly 21 patients had PR negative tumors and 20 95 2 of these were positive for Met PR positive tumors were found in seven of eight patients 87 5 in whom assays for Met in the axillary drainage were negative All the paraffin embedded sections of the resected primary breast cancers were assessed by immunohistochemistry staining for Met In 28 patients 90 3 the primary tumor stained positively for Met and none of the tumors that had negative staining had a positive Met RT PCR assay in the axillary drainage In addition the patients with negative staining had no involvement of lymph nodes Discussion HGF SF is synthesized as a pro HGF and once activated by the HGF activator HGFA the complex HGF SF Met affects numerous normal cellular processes 22 HGF SF Met is also involved in malignant transformation presumably as a mediator in interaction between tumor and stroma which enhances tumor progression and also angiogenesis 23 34 In invasive ductal carcinoma stronger expression of HGF SF seems to be associated with tubule formation 25 HGF SF is overexpressed in breast carcinoma in situ and invasive ductal carcinoma in comparison with normal breast tissue Normal mammary ducts within infiltrating cancer showed intermediate levels of HGF SF This finding suggests that the expression of these proteins in breast cancer is regulated by soluble factors produced by the tumor cells 26 27 High levels of expression of HGF and Met are associated with invasive breast cancer and might be causally linked to early recurrences metastatic disease and shortened survival of breast cancer patients 28 29 High levels of HGF SF detected within breast tumor extracts are correlated with larger tumor size and shorter relapse free and overall survival compared with tumors with low HGF SF concentration 30 The activation of HGF SF by HGFA might be modified by the two HGFA inhibitors HAI 1 and HAI 2 Highly invasive breast cancer cells express large amounts of HGF and Met and no HAI 1 whereas breast cancer cells with low invasive potential have low levels of HGF and Met and high levels of HAI 1 22 In a mouse model system HGF antagonists suppressed the conversion of pancreatic tumors from carcinoma in situ into invasive cancer 23 It seems that regulation of the HGF SF stimulation and inhibition activities is associated with the metastatic potential of tumor cells and knowing the status of HGFA HAI 1 and HAI 2 in addition to Met might provide useful information HGF SF and Met have been found in a variety of tumors 31 32 33 and in lymph nodes of patients with no tumor 34 but never in the fluid drained from the tumor bed or the lymph node basin In this study we evaluated whether Met can be detected in the axillary drainage of breast cancer patients and the significance of its expression in the lymphatic fluid Studying the expression of Met in the axillary fluid is a simple non invasive procedure because drains are routinely inserted during axillary lymph node dissections The collected fluid is readily available and RT PCR is a routine short assay with minimum artefacts The axillary fluid after breast and axillary lymph node operations includes erythrocytes lymphocytes epithelial cells and tumor cells One of the goals of this work was to examine whether tumor cells can be detected in the axillary drainage by RT PCR assays for Met To determine the source of Met in the axillary fluid in breast cancer patients and to exclude the possibility that the source was related to surgical trauma we evaluated a control group of melanoma patients with negative axillary sentinel lymph nodes In none of the control patients was the axillary drainage Met positive In 28 patients the primary tumor stained positively for Met and none of the tumors that had negative immunostaining had a positive Met RT PCR assay in the axillary drainage Thus it seems likely that the source of Met in the axillary fluid in node negative breast cancer patients is the tumor in the breast The results show that Met can be detected in the axillary drainage and although the number of patients was not high Met is associated with unfavorable prognostic factors Positive assays for Met are correlated with tumor size grade lymphatic invasion tumor involvement of the margins of the resected specimen the existence of metastases in the lymph nodes and the numbers of lymph nodes with tumor Met was associated with larger tumors and in none of the patients with tumors larger than 2 cm was the assay negative Moreover Met was never negative in patients with metastatic carcinoma in the lymph node Negative staining for ER and PR is associated with unfavorable prognosis and the assays for Met in the axillary fluid were positive in most receptor negative tumors One could postulate that because Met was highly correlated with tumor size its expression implies aggressive behavior of the malignant processes The significance of HGF SF as a marker of poor prognosis might also be associated with its effects on acquired resistance to anti cancer drugs 35 36 HGF SF protects cancer cells from DNA damaging chemotherapy agents through pathways involving signaling from Met to phosphoinositide 3 kinase and c Akt 29 Human breast cancer cells preincubated with HGF SF and then exposed to Adriamycin exhibit an altered pattern of gene expression compared with cells treated with Adriamycin alone Cells treated with HGF SF and Adriamycin also had modified cell line regulation and signal transduction that might suggest mechanisms by which HGF SF exerts its protective activity 31 To our knowledge this is the first report of the expression of Met in the axillary drainage in patients who have undergone operations for breast cancer The results suggest that the expression of Met in the axillary drainage might have prognostic significance More importantly its expression in histologically node negative patients point to the need to search for node micrometastasis or involvement of the excision margins by tumor Therefore RT PCR for Met in the axillary fluid of patients who undergo breast conserving surgery for breast cancer could influence therapy The results of this study justify prospective investigation on a larger scale and the clinical significance of Met positivity in the axillary drainage fluid in breast cancer patients should be defined by an extended follow up study Competing interests None declared Abbreivations ER estrogen receptor HGFA hepatocyte growth factor activator HGF SF
