                            Medicine might not be the oldest profession but the practice and the teaching of it        certainly stretch far back into antiquity In the developed world medical schools are now        thriving enterprises whose main aim remains to turn out sufficient numbers of welltrained        medical practitioners But alongside this primary purpose medical schools have become        centers of excellence for research also mostly basic scientific research Certainly the        medical schools of the University of Cambridge and University of California at San        Francisco UCSFthe two schools closest to the PLoS editorial officeshave large research        programs        Getting the balance right between understanding the research that will drive future        medical discoveries and providing training in clinical practice is obviously crucial in        training tomorrows doctors However followup studies of those who graduate suggest that        medical schools may not be producing doctors who are happy with the profession or who fit        all the needs of medical services today In the United Kingdom two striking observations        came out of recent surveys One is the difficulty in recruiting doctors who want to become        general practitioners the primary care doctors who form the backbone of the UK health        service Whereas in the s and s  of the qualifiers intended to enter general        practice in the s the proportion was only  BMJ   But even more        disturbing is the substantial proportion of doctors in the same surveys who indicated that        they regularly consider leaving medicine altogether Contrast these results with those of a        survey from Uganda where the survival of physicians was the most urgent concern From a        cohort of  doctors who graduated from the University of Makere Uganda in   had        died over the following  years BMJ   The most important cause of death was        presumed to be AIDS But all of the surviving doctors were in some form of medical        work        What these figures show perhaps more than anything is the difficulties of generalizing        about what are the top priorities for medical students across the globe To provide a place        for all students to debate the issues that matter to them         PLoS Medicine is launching the Student Forum a new quarterly section        written by medical students An international team of student advisers has been elected        that will help shape the content of this new section The Student Forum recognizes the        vital role that medical students have in guiding the future of the medical profession        The first Student Forum essay brings together students from three continents Brian        Palmer of the American Medical Student Association Amanda Wong of the European Medical        Students Association and Mohit Singla of the Indian Medical Students Organization They        lay out some of their concerns such as the need for medical education to distance itself        from the pharmaceutical industry and the importance of students worldwide having unfettered        access to the medical literature The students also ask questions about their training        commenting that the reductionistic logic of medical education offers only false comfort        and only to those who content themselves with pathways and receptors        Perhaps surprisingly this opinion is not far away from that of an established academic        clinician and editorial board member of         PLoS Medicine  Jonathan Rees In another essay in this issue Rees        similarly questions the overemphasis on basic research in medical schools posing the        question why are our institutions not fit for the purpose of improving patients        health        Not an easy question to answer but one that might also be relevant to the question of        what a medical journal especially one that wants to engage students should publish        Should we follow Reess advice on what the composition of a medical school curriculum        should be and have no more than  of our articles devoted to basic scientific research as        applied to medicine In this issue the balance of our research papers comes close to this        suggestion with one paper on the differentiation of insulinproducing cells from human        neural progenitors and other papers throughout the journal on topics as diverse as climate        and dengue fever treatment of malaria HIV genotypes prescription practices counterfeit        drugs Buruli ulcer and health and human rights But perhaps like the medical schools we        are not paying enough attention to other topics Rees points out as importantoperations        research decisionmaking informatics and economics        In his lightning trip through medicine         Blood and Guts A Short History of Medicine W W Norton  the        late medical historian Roy Porter wrote that the biomedical model can be myopic searching        ever more microscopically for disease but often omitting the wider picture of populations        environments and health In his description of the differing opinions on the role in th        century medical schools of the new practice of laboratory medicine it becomes clear that        the debate over what should be taught and what matters to medical students might not be        new but it is clearly as important as ever
