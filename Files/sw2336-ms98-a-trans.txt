 okay so what kind of car are you thinking about getting well none at the moment No no no well when you decide to i currently drive a a Ford Taurus and uh huh i would imagine i would imagine that if i change or if i get another car a new car i will go with the Taurus or something similar uh in that regard so you like the Ford absolutely i have had it for about two years now and it s uh uh huh it s everything it s supposed to be uh i haven t had a minutes trouble with it and uh uh huh the only thing i have against it in that s it s a Taurus but is it i still feel a little even after two years i still feel uncomfortable driving it because i had a Honda before that uh huh and so it s a little bit larger but that s the only the only difference that i see really right but i would my my criteria would be at the moment it would be uh American uh personally uh huh Yeah it s the this the car i had before this one was a Thunderbird as a matter of fact and uh i loved it i really did and um hum But uh um i finally decided to go check out what the uh what the uh foreign cars were So i bought myself a a a Nissan a two forty S X uh huh But even though i love the car i ve got now i think my next car will probably be American again because if i can at all do it i d like to stay American i always have up until now i just for one time decided to go outside So uh huh well my wife drives a still has a a Honda Accord and it s a very it s an excellent automobile uh huh uh huh and uh but you know price and so forth i m not a real car fan so i i i do not uh opt for uh something that would be you know expensive you know i want i want something that s serviceable serviceable something that i can use and uh and i and with the Taurus i have a Taurus uh you know LX and it s you know right uh huh you re talking when you think about price it s several thousand dollars lower than the comparable Honda or Nissan or something along those lines uh huh and as i said as far i m concerned it it has been extremely uh uh serviceable and everything i wanted well Ford s done a real good job in the last uh say ten years or at least the last five to ten six years so of really turning around their um quality i think um uh huh oh i think so too now i you know in travel and renting automobiles uh in i ve driven you know Chevrolet automobiles and so forth and Dodge and i uh huh if it s Chevrolet i just will not touch it uh um i had a Chevrolet before i bought my Taurus i purchased a uh huh a Chevy um Citation oh yeah those were not good cars and uh i was ready to get rid of it two months after i bought it and uh uh huh so i i shopped around and i would i probably if i had thought i uh wanted to pay the amount of money i probably would have gone with uh uh an Accord or even a a Civic or something comparable from Nissan or or Toyota uh huh right and uh but it was just i had i have a friend who uh has a uh an auto shop and he purchased one of the first Sables that was uh manufactured for his wife a Sable station wagon and he just absolutely swore by it uh huh and it was upon his recommendation and so forth for you know comparable comparably equipped you know with cruise control and air conditioning and AM FM radio and all these other things uh uh huh it was just there was no there was no comparison uh the only thing that i find you know if i would have anything against it is that it still has that soft American ride uh uh not well that about the only thing i find you know disadvantageous to it right but my criteria is simply something that looks good something that s serviceable and i you know i drive around a lot but uh and it s you know it s very comfortable on the highway i can drive for you know ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way uh huh but those are my criteria and i i probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again and if there s something out there that uh is comparable to what i have now so i ll go ahead and get it uh huh You know the only thing i m looking at right now um i just i just bought you know the Nissan that i ve got about uh say nine months ago i guess it was So the only thing that that would um get me to change cars right now would be if see at the moment i m single and if i were to get married and have a family that would have to have something to do with it But uh i don t have any plans for probably another two three years of even looking you know um hum uh huh uh cars are too expensive right now to uh i see yeah to even think about buying new cars every couple of years you know it s in our parking lots uh two or three days ago i saw one of the new Honda sports cars uh huh uh huh uh i i can t remember what the name is it s the thirty five or forty thousand dollar one whatever it is and it looked it resembled a Mazaratti very very closely um and it s an absolutely beautiful automobile and well appointed and so forth but uh huh to pay that much money for an automobile uh is just i can t i can t conceive of doing that yeah that s uh i went to a a car show down here about uh about two weeks ago and um you know of course they had the normal the Ford the the Chevrolet that stuff But then you started looking at the uh uh they had Ferrari there they had uh BMW and and all these other kind of cars and and Ferrari didn t even let you near the car i mean they were that s how expensive they were um hum um and then you saw uh hundred thousand dollar cars you saw eighty thousand dollar cars and you know even even though i i i do enjoy cars i enjoy um driving them i enjoy uh riding in them and everything but uh i can t see buying or paying more for a car than i would for a house you know i that s true well that doesn t seem likely uh the difference there is too is uh is between us is that i am not really crazy about driving i never have been since you know my parents had to force me to get my driver s license when i was young when i was sixteen uh huh uh huh so i ve never really cared now what i was you know before i was married and before i went to graduate school i used to do little you know sports car racing i never it was never my own car it was always someone else s uh huh and that sort of thing i enjoy but to go out and drive uh never has really been had any appeal to me in that regard so uh huh well i guess we ve discussed that enough don t you think we won t we don t we won t get the recorder or the uh system to shut us off uh tonight that s happened to me almost every time i ve i think so that s happened to me once so uh well when it s it s very easy when you get a topic you get on a topic that you know you enjoy and yeah like uh you know i think the one time i did it was on Saudi the Mid the Mid East the crisis out there and everything that was had a great conversation but uh then they came off and told us we couldn t do it any more so oh yeah yeah well i was talking to a lady last evening and we were talking about fishing and uh we were cut off uh huh well we were told to quit okay well you have a pleasant evening uh huh yeah you too uh huh bye bye take care good bye
