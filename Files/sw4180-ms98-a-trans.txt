        so uh how do you feel about the taxes you pay do you feel you pay uh too much or       about right or   well it it its the type of thing of what exactly am i getting out of the taxes and   yeah   to some extent there is definitely you know you can say all right im paying this money for this and this is what im getting back in terms of roads and highways and you know i guess quote unquote retirement if its actually there when we actually end up retiring   yeah its hard to tell   there there seems to be some problem you know some question on whether there will be actually money there or not   uhhuh   that i dont like about the taxes is i was looking through the IRS forms like uh the other day   uhhuh   i noticed that fourteen percent of the amount of money that we pay in for taxes each year is just going to pay the national debt   umhum now is that the debt uh  or is that just the interest on the debt   that that is the interest on the debt   yes you know i really dont understand this completely ive been a little mystified who who are we paying it to   ourselves   okay   um to a large extent i mean one of the i think im not sure if its the largest but i know a large segment of the national debt is um you know things like savings bonds and other government obligations   okay so its to private individuals who own government instruments of some sort   well not not just private but theres you know lot of public institutions that are holding money as well as a lot of um foreign companies and foreign persons   uhhuh   that are holding that but   okay so but these are nongovernmental entities   yeah nongovernmental   okay who are holding bonds and whatever   yeah you know Treasury Certificates and US Savings Bonds and whatever   okay yeah that is uh i mean well what what can they i mean whats to be done at this point increase that amount for sometime so it will eventually go down or i mean i imagine if youre just servicing the debt youre not really making any progress right   right well its actually uh you know also looking at the same form they had that we are borrowing the US is borrowing eighteen percent of the amount of of how how of whatever its spending every year   so were increasing the debt by an amount equal to eighteen percent of the annual budget   yeah so were borrowing eighteen percent and fourteen percent of what were paying out is going to pay the eighteen the uh debt so to some extent were borrowing money to pay   so   you know fourteen percent that were borrowing goes directly paying out to the debt   which is only increasing   yeah so were you know net were doing a net borrowing of four percent each year and then were doing a borrowing on top of that of fourteen percent that just goes to pay interest on the debt   right and uh then the question i mean do other countries do this or this a distinctly American phenomenon   that i dont know i dont know if uh other countries work as a deficit or not i from what i can understand its only recent within maybe the last fifty years or so   uhhuh   you know except for wartimes that the U S has had a peacetime debt   uhhuh well and i guess fifty years would pretty much jive with the last big wartime debt   yeah   and they just seemed like its a good idea why stop   yeah i i think if you look at some of the uh government spending curves um you know the the curve always went up around wartime and then dropped back down   uhhuh   after World War Two it never dropped back down or it was World War Two or uh Korea i think it never dropped back down   uhhuh so what do you think is the uh you know if you were in charge what would you what parts would you change to fix this problem   well you know definitely one thing is to say hey we have a year to year balanced budget   so at least we wouldnt have that additional uh what was it eighteen percent or yeah   yeah so you know you know maybe raise taxes for a few years until that debt gets paid off and then say you know unless there is a   uhhuh   tremendously bad circumstances like a war or something we should not be running a deficit economy you know thats i mean if you look on the individual level if i were to borrow eighteen percent of what i was spending every year year after year i would very quickly get in trouble with creditors   uhhuh   well it does seem like the uh the quality of the bonds that United States sell would eventually be downgraded doesnt it   um yeah well thats you know the post wartime Germany they just kept printing up money and you know it became worthless so thats one danger   uhhuh uhhuh umhum   but you know its that thats a very large chunk of the money we pay in for taxes each year   it is shocking but apparently no ones willing to oh im not no one but by the time it all ends up in Congress seems
