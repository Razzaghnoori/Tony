 The Only Living Boy in New York I wasn t paying much attention to the in house music on Christmas Eve I think it was Little Drummer Boy in the bookstore Jingle Bell Rock in the toy store or maybe vice versa but entering the flower shop it hit me instantly Bernadette From Paul Simon s Songs From the Capeman The bit just before he slows the whole thing down and goes I am Sal Mineo and I need you so It s a gorgeous song Simon s voice sounds as young as it did on Homeward Bound and the number brims with all the possibilities of teen romance in those hot 50s summers I ve been singing it ever since I heard the demo tape and I m glad that that florist liked it enough to play it But I wonder how many others will get to hear it The Capeman the story of an adolescent Puerto Rican killer is having a hard time taking off The album is selling tepidly the show s been picketed by victims rights groups and is under threat of more pickets by Puerto Ricans opposed to racial stereotyping the opening s been postponed to the end of the month and depending on which rumor you believe the director s either so complacent that he only bothers dropping by once a week or so dozy that he hasn t noticed he s been more or less replaced by Mike The Graduate Nichols Nick Miss Saigon Hytner or most recently Jerry Guys and Dolls Zaks So far so normal for a Broadway show in previews But The Capeman isn t just another dud musical like Sideshow or The Scarlet Pimpernel It was supposed to be the show that would heal the great historic rift between pop music and theater scores the first show written specifically for Broadway by a major rock songwriter and the one that would entice all the others in ending the Great White Way s dependence on its shrunken nontalent pool of insipid Sondheim clones They say they want something new but they don t really says Paul Simon They want something old We re standing a gazillion floors above Broadway about a week or so before it all began to go wrong One wouldn t want to characterize the diminutive balding rock star as being in Cole Porter s marvelous phrase down in the depths on the 90 th floor but a faint tinge of melancholy hangs in the air What do you think he says Do you think they want something new They are the elderly lizardlike survivors who preside over what s left of Broadway the nonshowy showmen party bookers and theater owners into whose hands Simon has more or less delivered himself He seems genuinely befuddled by them In the rock biz most of the executives are old too But at least they make an effort sporting ponytails and U2 tour jackets they don t continually give the impression that they wish there was a part for Robert Goulet in whatever it is they are working on Around Broadway the standard line is that Simon with his reputation for arrogance and as a control freak has disdained their expertise In the beginning says Simon they said to me there s about five or six people in the world who can do this and here are their names And I believed it what did I know That s why we ve been through several directors Derek Walcott and I didn t want an auteur director We had taken years to write it so why would we want someone who says I think this part should go over here and that character is really a woman His voice trails away If that s arrogant To prepare for The Capeman Simon put himself through a dispiriting crash course in recent Broadway attractions I saw a couple of shows I liked but most I didn t I really liked Tommy I liked Guys and Dolls er I kinda liked Show Boat But the rest of the stuff I can t say I found interesting One wouldn t want to exaggerate the points of contact but curiously The Capeman is the first musical since Show Boat in 1927 to use the word niggers in its opening number Afraid to leave the project to cross into another neighborhood The blancos and the nigger gangs well they d kill you if they could They re not quite the first Simon lyrics to be heard on stage That distinction belongs to Leonard Bernstein s hippie theater piece Mass which contains one quatrain by Simon Half of the people are stonedAnd the other half are waiting for the next electionHalf the people are drownedAnd the other half are swimming in the wrong direction He just liked the lyrics says Simon I said he could have them in return for opening night tickets which he never sent me They were originally written for a Zeffirelli film that Bernstein and Simon were working on Lenny fancied himself as pretty hip but his young collaborator wasn t impressed by the older man s attempts at rock He played a melody and it was an awkward moment He said If we re going to collaborate we have to be completely honest So what do you think I said Well that s not very good That s not rock n roll He was taken aback The composer drew himself up and said huffily This is Leonard Bernstein music If you re a bona fide rock star it s hard to take seriously the theater s nervous tiptoeing into the territory I never thought Hair was really rock n roll says Simon but now supposedly he grins it s a classic Hair Godspell the title song of Phantom the current sensation Rent the rock opera that so distracted killer Brit nanny Louise Woodward from her household duties all are unconvincing hybrids neither good rock nor good show tunes The conventional wisdom argued by Sondheim among others is that rock is difficult to use dramatically Well I don t think it s difficult retorts Simon But the people who were trying to write it weren t coming from rock n roll they were doing an impression of rock n roll And since everyone knows what rock n roll sounds like it wasn t fooling very many people In fairness the theater found it hard to attract genuine rockers At the end of his life Alan Jay Lerner author of My Fair Lady used to bemoan that Simon and his generation had never written for Broadway But rock lyricists earn their reputations with the kind of elliptical poetic impenetrability that looks great reprinted on a 1960 gatefold LP sleeve However when you re sitting in a theater you get one chance to grab those words as they re flying across the footlights at you It s a surprise then to find that The Capeman s lyrics are more direct less allusive that after years of writing more and more about himself Simon has been able to write in the voice of characters far less articulate I don t know whether he s arrogant or a control freak in the studio or the rehearsal room but where it counts in the music and lyrics you can hear a man who is at 57 still trying to learn Just under a decade ago I did a TV special with Simon that was filmed partly at his office in the Brill Building The director spent the morning setting up a perfect shot for the interview looking down Broadway the picture framed by the Cats marquee at the Winter Garden and the 42 nd Street billboard in Times Square Simon peeked through the camera and said That s just a generic shot of Broadway That s nothing to do with who I am So everything was dismantled and the crew set up at the opposite corner of the room away from the window It was a telling image Simon was literally turning his back on Broadway Not anymore Clearly it s still not an entirely comfortable fit But whatever happens to The Capeman I hope he won t give up on the theater There s more musical invention in a song like Trailways Bus than in the entire score of the much ballyhooed Ragtime It s nothing to do with rock vs showtunes only with the cruel truth that most contemporary Broadway music isn t very good not popular music not serious music but existing in some grisly limbo in between Broadway can t afford to kiss off a rare musical voice like Simon s no matter how much glee it might afford the Schadenfreude set Negotiating a tricky midlife career change caught between rock and a hard place Paul Simon figures that sometimes as with Graceland the gamble pays off Every few years people decide they re bored and they want something fresh So that s a good time to have something fresh He shrugs fatalistically The rest of the time they say nyyah I don t get it
