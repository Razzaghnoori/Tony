 Media Morbidity Report Hi Jim I will graciously forgive your East Coast obsessions if you will indulge me in the San Francisco media sport du jour writing your own obituary You see things have been a little morbid over the weekend in the San Francisco dailies since Friday when Hearst announced the purchase of the San Francisco Chronicle and put a for sale sign on the San Francisco Examiner By most accounts putting the Examiner on the block is just a cynical move to assuage the concerns of the Justice Department before Hearst closes the afternoon paper and turns the city into one more one daily town The Good Housekeeping et al takeover of the Chronicle and the presumed sickness unto death of the Examiner has touched off an orgy of retrospectives in both papers complete with fond remembrances of the way things were in the good old days Rest in peace Herb Caen sniff In the case of the Examiner it s weirdly uncomfortable to read its coverage sort of like listening to an elderly relative talk obsessively about his own imminent death Incidentally Nixon is relegated to Page A2 in today s San Francisco Chronicle while a story about pruneburgers those would be your basic hamburgers with prunes on top being tried out in California high school cafeterias gets Page 1 treatment It s complete with quotes from a California prune industry trade group exalting In our taste test the students really liked them You don t say This is the other not on the Web pleasure of reading the papers in the dead tree format seeing just how strongly the editors feel that fibrous school lunch menu innovations as promoted by local industry clearly rank above the 25th anniversary of the resignation of the president among their readers concerns All this grim navel gazing here in San Francisco not to mention all that fiber is enough to make a West Coast reader reach first for the New York Times on Monday morning only to discover that her own profession is in decline Jim I regret to inform you that magazines ain t what they use to be according to Alex Kuczynski s At Magazines the Art of Stirring Debates Seems Lost The Internet is predictably trotted out as one of the myriad of causes of the glossies decline Ironic for the two of us since as magazine writers we both cover the Web Overall it s a nicely argued and sourced piece but it makes me wonder Is it worse to be a magazine writer if magazines have lost clout or a newspaper reporter who writes about magazines if magazines have lost clout It s enough to make you want to write your own obituary and go back to bed Navel gazingly yours Katharine P S Just so you know who you re dealing with I ll admit right now I never read the Washington Post although I am a fan of Media Grok
