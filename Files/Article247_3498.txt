 Harry s Magic Pride Brilliant Tony brilliant I love your interpretation of the wizard world as parallel to the gay world the young wizard s gradual recognition of his difference the sudden revelation that there are tons of other people like him Do you see a Magic Pride movement starting with witches and wizards insisting that muggles accept them and grant them civil rights I m longing to go to the Magic Pride March imagine the floats and costumes I like your idea of foreign wizardry too Did you ever read Kingdoms of Elfin by Sylvia Townsend Warner It s another out of print work of genius that could plausibly come back on the wind of Harry s success Warner wrote a series of stories I think but I m not sure that a lot of them were published in The New Yorker in the 70s about communities of fairies living in various countries They re partly exquisite little parodies of travel lit partly cruel little fables As usual try getting a grown up to read them you can hear them muttering Fairies Come on in their heads But these stories are certainly not children s literature The fairies are heartless and creepy which makes them human enough that they re weirdly touching In Elfhame in Scotland here s how they treat changelings Every day a fasting weasel bites the child s neck and drinks its blood for three minutes The amount of blood drunk by each successive weasel who is weighed before and after the drinking is replaced by the same weight of a distillation of dew soot and aconite Though the blood to ichor transfer does not cancel human nature the distillation is only approximate elfin blood contains several unanalyzable components one of which is believed to be magnetic air it gives considerable longevity Dear little thing said Tiphaine the queen of Elfhame all Warner s elfin kingdoms are matriarchies I hope he won t age prematurely For when grey hairs appear on the head of a changeling he is put out of the hill to make the rest of his way through the human world which is why we see so many grey haired beggars on the roads Or this The Elfin Court of Zuy in the Low Countries was wealthy and orderly No winter gales penetrated its polished windows if the summer sun shone too vehemently blinds were pulled down to protect the furnishings Drinking bouts were long taciturn and ended in somnolence The Queen was celebrated for her pearls It would be fun to take a school trip with the Hogwarters and see what details Rowling would assemble to build national styles of wizardry But I think your other scenario a foreign teacher joins Hogwarts is much more likely Notice how Rowling structures the books in strict parallel centered around the school First we get a few chapters of Harry at home with his awful muggle relatives who lock him in the closet starve him and cower at the thought that he might perform magic his frustration at not being allowed to is part of the amusement of this section Then we get a visit to Diagon Alley a hidden street in London where witches and wizards shop for this year s school supplies Then the trip to Hogwarts generally on the Hogwarts Express which leaves from the invisible Platform Nine and Three Quarters at King s Cross At Hogwarts we get the rhythms of the school year the classes new teachers spells gone wrong midnight feasts Quidditch competitions bad marks for mischief exams Christmas break and so on At some point usually the climax we visit the Forbidden Forest a spot of hazard and wonder right on school grounds What s amazing is how Rowling manages to cleave strictly to this formula yet provide such a wealth of new details and such deep dangerous plots that every book seems completely new It s a trick other people have used P L Travers in the Mary Poppins books for example always has a chapter in which one of the kids loses her temper one in which we visit a relative of Mary Poppins for tea one in which Mary has a birthday and so on But Rowling isn t just writing independent chapters her novels have an overall trajectory that deepens and develops from book to book It s as if she s writing a sequence of sonnets Not a succubus by the way A succubus is a female demon that comes to you in the night while you re asleep and has sex with you against your will I was thinking of a monster that looks like an ordinary woman until you see her legs which she doesn t have Instead there s a snake tail or a puddle of oozing rot I ve seen her called a melusine but I think there s another name Maybe one of our readers can think of it I m still interested in hearing your thoughts about the question you posed a few messages back Why Harry why now Best Polly
