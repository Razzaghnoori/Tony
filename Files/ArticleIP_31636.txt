 A Shot From the Pews Cross Check I agree with most of Steve Chapman s conclusions in I will say unashamedly that I am a born again Christian But I will also say that you are very correct in pointing out the basic statistical mistake of implying causation from correlation I think it is naive to think that simply posting copies of the Ten Commandments is going to solve the nation s crime problem I also think it is damaging to the faith to try and use religion to solve social problems God becomes a means to an end instead of an end in Himself He is not a magical potion that you can sprinkle on your problems to make them go away I do think that genuine faith and a relationship with God will cure violence and murder and such however imposing religion on people is not the answer I think one of the reasons there is a positive correlation between religion and crime in the States is because large portions of so called Christians in this country are nominal at best Also I think that the number of churchgoers in a given area is relatively inconsequential in this whole equation If someone could prove that it was the Christians committing all the crimes then we would have an interesting situation But if that is not the case then it makes no difference how many Christians there are The real issue then becomes the motivations for the population of criminals which are things such as the social structure and the justice system Jonathan Minter Lynchburg Va In Order To Form an Imperfect Union It is wrong I think to suggest as William Saletan does in Frame Game that our current health care crisis is caused by the unreasonable expectations of the people who seek medical care The reason patients expect better care than they re willing to pay for is that they have already paid for it Medical advances are made through government subsidy directly through tax supported universities or indirectly in the form of tax write offs for private sector research and development The hospitals that we go to and our doctors practice in essentially all receive some level of governmental funding Our doctors attended medical school with the aid of federally guaranteed student loans or outright grants We paid for the ability to provide the best care in the world and we continue to pay far more in terms of percentage of gross average annual individual income than any other Western society Most of the doctors I know are hard working compassionate professionals They certainly provide an essential service They all make a ton of dough and I don t know anyone who begrudges them that The current medical payment scheme in the United States makes the very best medical care available but is also an active barrier to many who seek basic care and cannot afford it Radical reform is clearly called for but will never happen as long as free market principles control access to this service Our current dilemma has come about because we tried to shift cost control away from the service providers This has had the effect of driving many capable physicians out of their own practices and into exactly the kind of alienating impersonal bean counting HMO setting that has caused the American Medical Association to try and become a union It is sad that the best technical health care system in the world is delivered so poorly that the professionals charged with caring for us feel compelled to sacrifice their independence in this way Unionization is a bad idea that will only make things worse William C Altreuter Buffalo N Y Mistaken Condemnation Eric Alterman s in your letters column of June 30 that my colleague Harvey Klehr and I felt the need to condemn a Jacob Heilbrunn article in the New Republic is mistaken We disagreed with a judgment Heilbrunn advanced in his essay but disagreement is not condemnation Indeed that one disagreement aside we have a very high regard for Heilbrunn s writings In view of the fact that in the letter to which Alterman referred we clearly expressed our appreciation of other remarks Mr Heilbrunn made in his essay no responsible commentator could use the characterization used by Alterman John Earl Haynes Kensington Md Eric Alterman replies I dunno This seems a semantic issue at best Heilbrunn s article attacked Yale s Annals of Communism series and the decision by its editorial director Jonathan Brent not to offer Heilbrunn s old professor Vladimir Brovkin to edit a series of books about the Gulag He then accused Brent and Yale of having caved in to the ethos of historical correctness governed by revisionists who dismiss as cold war humbug the notion that the Soviet Union was a totalitarian country Klehr and Haynes wrote a strong letter in support of Brent s editorial leadership and of Brent himself They maintained that he had steadfastly insisted on the academic integrity of the series and staunchly defended their work In other words virtually everything Heilbrunn wrote about Brent and his alleged cowardice as well as his many criticisms of the Yale series was wrong Haynes says this does not constitute a condemnation Fine I ll grant it if he feels the distinction to be an important one I only hope no one ever decides to demonstrate his or her high regard for my writings in this peculiar fashion
