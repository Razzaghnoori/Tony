 well ironically enough i m sitting here with a cast on my leg because i resumed an aerobics class the night before last oh no i ripped the ligaments in my right ankle awe yeah so exercise is not supposed to do that to you that s what the nurses kept saying as they laughed all the way you know down the hallway uh huh do you do anything on a regular basis well i i off and on off and on right now i ve been off off but um i ve been going over to the fitness center yeah that s a good yeah i my husband s a TIer in the house unit here yeah three times yeah three uh huh well i try to go over there at least three times a week and i try to walk um at least five times a week do you when you go to the Texans i have to ask you and if this is getting to we re not supposed to get too particular but i m just curious uh huh when you go over there does it bother you in terms of how things are arranged either at the Dallas location or the Spring Creek in terms of there s so much it s so much of a weight orientation weight lifting et cetera yeah uh well i ve been going to Spring Creek i haven t been to the Dallas one now in oh a couple of years yeah well at least since they ve redone it supposedly redone uh huh yeah it s well it s not that great and i go to the Spring Creek one on and off but my husband s working over there and he just goes to the Dallas one but i just don t i mean it s just so much weight lifting even the Spring Creek one has a lot of weights in it so i don t really know what yeah yeah that s true or is that what your into or no no well i ve i ve used the Nautilus equipment and the bikes and stair climbers and stuff like that mostly i don t use the free weights but uh huh yeah i like the tread mill and the stair master myself over there yeah i like those too and the pool yeah that s great and the pool when it gets warmer yeah i know well what i did was i went to a jazzercise class in a new location in Richardson near where we live in North Dallas and long story short i hadn t this is really a stupid thing that happened but they have like the gymnasium flooring and then like they had about three feet of linoleum around the perimeter in the back where i usually stand uh huh in any class like that i go to instead of having that level you know uh huh they had a chrome strip that wasn t level and it was about four inches deep and then about oh a seventy degree angle oh my goodness and as we were jumping around or doing something i just jumped up and came right down on it um the orthopedist called it a uh basketball injury where the ankle just rolls under you and it snapped uh huh woo i know we went to uh HDA well whatever in Plano and the emergency room was like a bad comedy show and the doctor said you didn t do anything there s only a one in five hundred chance that the radiologist will call you that was Tuesday night and Wednesday night the radiologist called me at work and uh i was on crutches and he said i think you better call an orthopedist uh huh uh huh um so we went to one and he just put a big old cast on it put a big cast on it yeah for about four weeks four weeks yeah so i mean i like aerobics but i m not so sure well not that much though no i ve never i was off for about six months too just for some other surgery i d had but i ve never i d you know i was pretty much in shape walking and and you know this is one of those things like this orthopedist said he said you d be surprised how many basketball how many people come in here with things like that because they are active yeah you know i was real embarrassed but i felt kind of stupid well those things happen though yeah they do i mean i guess i m glad you know that um nobody really noticed i guess you could say yeah because i got up and started jumping on it again well that did a lot of good i m sure yeah really so i enjoy aerobics and i do it because i like it i mean i like the music and yeah that kind of stuff i like the music but i ve been unable to do that because i hurt my foot about five years ago i broke my heel oh and uh so that makes my foot how d you do that in aerobics no no actually i was up on a ladder and uh fell off leaned the wrong way oh goodness uh huh and when i came down i hit with my full weight on my foot but on concrete what d they do for that did they have to cast it and yeah they had well they had to go in and do surgery they put a pin in it oh so the aerobics the impact would not be good yeah yeah that cause i permanently damaged the the uh cushion under my heel you know the normal cushion that you have there so oh goodness uh huh i can t do any jumping up and down because it makes it hurt oh that makes sense so i mean are you in terms of other things like like like not running but playing a little bit of tennis or can you not do stuff like that at all uh well i haven t tried that i don t know it s been i bet it s it s been thirty years since i played tennis yeah it s been but um mostly into just walking and stuff like that that s probably the safer way because i notice in aerobics um lot of the women that that don t look like they shouldn t be doing certain things uh huh i m always afraid they re going to fall over and have a coronary coronary yeah and there was my ego when i went ahead and i went oh i can do that and uh huh half the time though i don t um jump half as much as i mean i m like i m real tall and you know i m i m not heavy but when you go easy a hundred seventy at my height um i m five eleven uh hum uh hum oh you know you just take it easy um but when i see some women i mean some and i just don t think it s healthy all that pounding all the time sure it isn t really it s not really good for your knees so yeah that s the other reason and uh hum i don t know this was just i guess something freak that happened to me because i wasn t familiar with the um well the floor was uneven you know oh it was completely i mean it literally the two dissimilar floor level floor coverings were not level and at first after it happened i thought maybe that s a handicap access and then i said no that s just the way it s constructed sure yeah yeah and my husband being a TI engineer i said i said a few things to him when i got home i said who has engineered that real ly but i uh sounds like you like one thing that i like like swimming you like that a lot uh huh yeah i like swimming uh huh do you like that what d that voice say do you like to exercise because you want to or because you have to uh no i like i like it because i i want to it makes me feel better that s how i am yeah yeah if i don t do it i just feel like i don t have as much energy uh huh i mean it s real funny because if you you know it seems like when you exercise and expend the energy that you d be tired but it s the other way around right it curbs the appetite and helps with the calories and all that stuff uh huh yeah really yeah and i need all the help i can get yeah but that gravity factor i know uh hum uh huh it does get you like that orthopedist said to me he said don t worry Diane he says he said uh you re at thirty something but you re on the upper side he said that uh don t worry he says even if you weren t doing anything your body would start that would start to happen to you but thanks a lot yeah because i was saying to him i said i m not that heavy i m not heavy you know maybe ten to fifteen pounds like any other human being uh huh i said uh why do i feel like i need to start pushing myself more and he goes human nature no and then you know you see these little girls in these little bitty things and they re all like twenty one years of age uh huh uh hum but luckily at Texans there s a little more diverse diverse clientele that s true they do except for the guys that lift the weights they do intimidate they do yeah i try try to go real late or real early before they get there there s yeah there some things i d like to try but you know sometime when i ask i just feel like boy am i stupid or what uh huh that s one thing i like about the Spring Creek place at least the fellow that s there one of the fellows that s there at night and on weekends is real helpful uh huh and his name is B J and i don t think i ve ever i think i ve that there was some girl there i ve been there like maybe a dozen times but i actually like that site better than the other one just because of the type people that go to uh huh uh huh it s terrible it s i don t know if the Dallas location it just seems that um sometimes i feel like i m in a singles bar yeah yeah that s true yeah i and i haven t haven t noticed that up at Spring Creek no i haven t either and i just uh it s not that far of a drive and i m glad they did that um you re not missing anything at the Dallas renovated site it s not at all anything worth talking about yeah i thought maybe one of these days i ll drive over there and check it out but yeah but if you don t live near there that s not worth yeah i live in Richardson but it s about half way between the Spring Creek and the the Dallas site so we yeah that s that s actually where this happened to me out in i say Plano but it s all the same to me Richardson over on Campbell and Park Hill there s a uh new recreation center uh huh uh huh and uh as we were doing it too everybody noticed that there were all these big guys of assorted nationalities to play basketball waiting around for us and as we walked out i was limping and i m like oh great i have purple tights on you know uh huh and they re going yes but in general i like to exercise i i like dance a lot so i mean i aerobics is something i d hate to give up but uh huh uh huh he he kind of said something to me about probably not as bad as your foot but he just said to me maybe you ought to try bicycling or yeah probably will for a while because it it s going to be real tender when they he told me eight to twelve weeks not anything you know i said but you re only going to put the cast on for a couple of weeks he said yeah but uh huh that s just they tried to put me in some kind of um immobilized walker because he doesn t like to put casts on when it s warm but i just the more they tried to get my foot in the more i screamed i couldn t you know yeah i know what you mean adjust that well you you know more about this stuff than i do obviously then not fun no well you re walking okay now obviously and you can oh yeah i have a slight limp from it but it matches one if i have one on the other side yeah yeah you know so you re still able to walk yeah well is there anything else about exercise we can talk about well other than i need to go you know more yeah me too me too i need to go actually get something to eat here i need go more but it s great though i really do enjoy it okay thank you Sandy sure thanks then uh huh bye bye bye bye
