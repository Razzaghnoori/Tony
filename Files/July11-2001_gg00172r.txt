 B285663 facility design review area discussed in the study as well as the efforts that have been made by federal agencies to address the conditions covered in the study Results in Brief According to the FFC study opportunities exist to significantly reduce total project cost TPC by conducting an effective design review process The study found that effective design review practices result in less rework on the part of the construction contractor fewer change orders to correct design errors and omissions and lowering the cost of belatedly adding project upgrade features that should have been addressed in the original design FFC reported that historically 30 to 50 percent of all construction change orders result from errors in the design documents directly related to improper interfaces between design disciplines civil structural architectural electrical and mechanical The FFC study notes that attention should be focused on review of designs during the conceptual planning and design phases where the ability to influence ultimate functionality and cost of the project is the greatest The study states that the potential savings resulting from conducting effective design reviews range from a minimum of 3 percent to as much as 20 percent of TPC and even higher when indirect savings are taken into account The FFC study concludes that in the end effective review of designs maximizes the probability that a mission or operational requirement will be successfully supported by a facility that was conceived designed constructed and placed into operation efficiently and effectively The study identifies 18 best practices that federal agencies and other facility owners can use to manage and or oversee design reviews throughout the facility acquisition process It organized the best practices into five categories related to 1 the role of the owner 2 teamwork and collaboration 3 advance planning 4 process and 5 benchmarking Background FFC formerly the Federal Construction Council is a continuing activity of the Board on Infrastructure and the Constructed Environment of the National Research Council NRC It is a cooperative association of 20 federal agencies with interests and responsibilities related to all aspects of facility design acquisition management maintenance and evaluation FFC is convened under the aegis of NRC the operating arm of the National Academies Its mission is to identify and advance technologies processes and management practices that improve the performance of federal facilities over their entire life cycle from planning to disposal The federal agencies that sponsored the facility design review study which was produced as an element of the FFC s 1999 Technical Activities Program included the Department of the Air Force Office of the Civil Engineer Department of the Air Force Air National Guard ANG Department of the Army Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management Department of Energy DOE Department of the Navy Naval Facilities Engineering Command NAVFAC Department of State DOS Office of Foreign Buildings Operations B285663 Department of Veterans Affairs VA Office of Facilities Management Food and Drug Administration General Services Administration GSA Public Buildings Service Indian Health Service IHS International Broadcasting Bureau National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA Facilities Engineering Division National Institutes of Health NIH National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST Building and Fire Research Laboratory National Science Foundation Smithsonian Institution Office of Facilities Services and U S Postal Service USPS FFC s study discusses the results of a questionnaire survey of nine federal agencies that acquire maintain and operate a significant inventory of buildings and other constructed facilities in supporting their mission 2 Questionnaires were answered by agency headquarters senior facilities engineering program directors and fieldactivitylevel project managers In addition FFC used the results from research done by The Business Roundtable TBR NRC U S Army Corps of Engineers USACE Construction Industry Institute CII 3 and other FFC efforts as well as others to augment the study A literature search was used to identify facility acquisition practices and industry trends as well as best practices and technologies being used to provide adequate management and oversight of design reviews Supplemental information was obtained through interviews with various public agencies private sector facility owners trade and professional organizations and A E firms in order to characterize the current state of the art from a broader perspective The federal government the nation s largest building owner acquires buildings and other structures to support specific functions and missions and the general conduct of its business It spends more than 20 billion a year for facility design construction and related services Owners the government included traditionally have maintained some level of internal facility planning and design oversight capability to ensure that new facilities acceptably balance the factors of cost schedule quality and performance Over the last decade as a result of efforts to reduce the size of government agencies have downsized their design and engineering staffs and relied more on outside consultants for technical expertise Although agencies have generally retained their design oversight responsibilities fewer staff resources are now devoted to reviewing facility designs The changes in the facilities acquisition environment led FFC to conclude that a review of issues practices and methods related to the design phase of the acquisition process would be beneficial 2 The report was authored by Ralph S Spillinger in conjunction with the FFC Standing Committee on Organizational Performance and Metrics Mr Spillinger is a retired federal official with 30 years experience in planning

Findings The core issues of the FFC study concern the value added by design review processes and the appropriate role of facilities owners particularly federal agencies in such processes In developing a detailed scope of work for its study FFC found that no two of the sponsoring agencies defined the design review process and its elements in exactly the same way Nor was a common start or end point identified for design review In view of the lack of commonly accepted definitions of the elements duration and substance of the design review process FFC decided to focus on practices for reviewing facility design over the entire facility acquisition process The study viewed design review as a multiphased process not limited to the reviewing of designs during the design phase of the acquisition The objective of the study was to identify a range of best practices and technologies that could be used by federal agencies and other owners to provide adequate management and oversight of design reviews throughout the facility acquisition process Briefly the FFC study presents five key findings on design review processes Effective design review processes add value by saving time and money over the entire facilities acquisition process Effective design review processes result in the preparation of more comprehensive and accurate design and construction documents that in turn result in lower project construction costs Areas of savings include less rework on the part of the construction contractor fewer change orders to the owner for correction of design errors or omissions and a lowering of the cost of belatedly adding project upgrade features that should have been addressed in the original design Indirect cost savings can be realized by avoiding costs associated with loss of productivity during constructiondelayed facility startup and with litigation In short effective review of designs maximizes the probability that a business requirement will be successfully supported by a facility that was conceived designed constructed and placed into operation efficiently and effectively The team responsible for design oversight should include representatives of all project stakeholders owner user A E construction contractor operation and maintenance staff and major equipment vendors The team should participate in and contribute to designrelated activities associated with each phase of the facility acquisition process from conceptual planning through startup The use of metrics by federal agencies to measure the value added by design review processes is not well established Although research has been done by the Construction Industry Institute and other organizations to identify metrics that may be used to measure both the efficiency and the effectiveness of each phase of the facility acquisition process the extent to which individual federal agencies measure design review processes and analyze results is highly variable B285663 To provide effective oversight of design review processes the owner s interests are best served when the inhouse staff can fulfill the functions of a smart buyer A smart buyer is one who retains an inhouse staff who understands the organization s mission its requirements and its customer needs and who can translate those needs and requirements into corporate direction A smart buyer also retains the requisite capabilities and technical knowledge to lead and conduct teaming activities accurately define the technical services needed recognize value during the acquisition of such technical services and evaluate the quality of services ultimately provided As long as the owner retains the inhouse capabilities to operate as a smart buyer of facilities there does not appear to be any greater risk from contracting out a broad range of design reviewrelated functions so long as such functions are widely available from a competitive commercial marketplace If the owner does not have the capacity to operate as a smart buyer the owner risks project schedule and cost overruns and facilities that do not meet performance objectives The ongoing revolution in information technology and communications offers opportunities to improve design review processes Examples include audio and video teleconferencing immediate and widespread data distribution via the Internet computeraided design and drafting and a wide range of project management software Emerging technologies such as the use of holographic projection techniques to create threeand fourdimensional models of project designs guarantee a continuing stream of future enhancements The FFC study identifies 18 best practices for the review of designs which it summarized as follows Role of the Owner Be a smart buyer Develop a scope of work that clearly and accurately defines the owner s expectations regarding cost schedule performance and quality Avoid the temptation to micromanage the design review process Teamwork and Collaboration Use teambuilding and partnering techniques Ensure that all interested parties participate in design review processes Use the same A E throughout the process Use senior experienced staff to evaluate the evolving design and guide the review process Commit for the duration of the activity Participate in a design awards program B285663 Advance Planning Focus attention at the front end during the conceptual planning and design phases where the ability to influence the ultimate cost of the project is the greatest Do not start the final stage of design until the preliminary engineering is complete Process Tailor the review approach to project specifics Keep up the pace of the process to maintain momentum Pay special attention to civil structural architectural electrical and mechanical interfaces Exploit technology Conduct a postoccupancy evaluation to develop a lessonslearned document Benchmarking Measure results achieved by the design process Document both unusually good and bad performance FFC s study identifies four areas where it was felt that additional cooperation research and discussion could lead to either fundamentally new approaches or significant improvements to current practices These areas are establishment of a seniorlevel advisory group on federal facilities issues identification of a set of metrics that could be used to measure performance across all phases of the facility acquisition process evaluation of current practices of federal agencies with regard to the standards guidelines and policies supplied to A Es in support of facility acquisition activities and study of the potential benefits of establishing a peer review process for agency design review practices The study also identifies a number of federal agency initiatives related to the design review process These initiatives are included in the enclosure to this letter which provides a more detailed presentation of pertinent information extracted from the FFC study relating to the changing facilities acquisition environment confronting federal agencies today facility acquisition practices and trends and best practices Government Industry Forum On May 24 2000 FFC sponsored a government industry forum on best practices for reviewing facility designs Approximately 120 individuals from 30 federal agencies registered to attend the forum The major participants were GSA all branches of the Department of Defense DOS DOE NASA and the Smithsonian Institution The forum highlighted identified best practices and tools that can be used by federal agencies and other facility owners to manage and or oversee design reviews throughout the facility B285663 acquisition process The findings and 18 best practices highlighted in the FFCsponsored study were presented to the forum participants by FFC Government and industry practitioners discussed best practices tools and processes they have used or seen used to review facility designs and suggested how federal agencies could use such tools and processes to foster quality design In addition presentations were made on three systems that have been developed to support different aspects of the design review process These design review tools were the Army s DrChecks software program for documenting collecting distributing and archiving design review comments the Construction Industry Institute s CII Project Definition Rating Index for preproject planning and the REDICHECK Interdisciplinary Coordination system for design reviews the first system designed specifically to correct the interdisciplinary coordination discrepancies that account for about half of the construction change orders involving errors and omissions FFC Comments On May 24 2000 we asked both the FFC Staff Director and the primary author of

corporations and other organizations acquires facilities to support specific functions and missions and the general conduct of its business Confronted with a requirement to acquire a building or other constructed facility owner organizations both public and private traditionally participate in a multiphased process involving conceptual planning design procurement construction and startup Throughout this process owners usually maintain some level of design oversight to ensure that the acquired facility is an acceptable balance of cost schedule quality and performance Until the 1990s federal agencies often maintained an inhouse facilities engineering organization comprised in part of architects and engineers responsible for both the technical aspects and the oversight of the planning and design phases of the acquisition process As a result of executive and legislative initiatives to reduce the size of the government federal agencies have downsized their design and engineering staff Agencies are increasingly using outside consultants to provide technical expertise for the planning and design phases of both new projects and major renovations of existing facilities Although oversight responsibility for the facility planning and design phases generally remains within the agencies fewer staff resources are being devoted to the effort than in the past Concurrent with downsizing procurement regulations have been modified to allow agencies greater flexibility and choice in selecting contracting methods for acquiring facilities As recently as 5 years ago the designbidbuild method of facility acquisition was used almost exclusively Today agencies increasingly rely on designbuild construction management and program management contracting methods Further advances in computeraided design and other technologies are occurring Defining Design Review simultaneously with process changes in federal agencies increasing the importance of technology support in the design process Prior to developing a detailed scope of work for the study the sponsor agencies shared information on their own design review processes and the design review processes of some private sector organizations with which they were familiar Analysis of this information revealed that no two of these organizations defined the design review process and its various elements in exactly the same manner Nor was a common start or end point identified for design review as an element of the facility acquisition process For some organizations design review was limited to reviewing a consultantprepared schematic design to ensure that it met the owner organization s functional requirements for floor area functional adjacencies and connections and budget For other organizations design review primarily involved reviewing a more detailed facility design prepared by an inhouse design team or a private A E firm under contract The level of the review and the elements reviewed for example architectural reviews mechanical and electrical interface reviews or constructability1 reviews also varied Some processes were formal incorporating design reviews at specific design milestones such as at 15 30 and 60 percent of design completion Others were less formal relying on periodic meetings between the owner and the design team to review the progress being made toward preparation of final construction contract plans and specifications The core issues of the FFC study concerned the valueadded of design Study Purpose and review processes and the appropriate level of oversight for owners of Objective facilities particularly federal agencies in such processes FFC s objective was to identify a range of best practices and technologies that can be used by federal agencies and other owners to provide adequate management and oversight of design reviews throughout the facility acquisition process Specifically it sought to provide answers to the following questions What is the valueadded of design review processes How do and how can federal agencies measure the valueadded 1 In constructability reviews experienced construction managers look for such items as inappropriate materials physical barriers and complex interfaces that will unnecessarily complicate the construction phase Page 9 GAO GGD00172R Study on Facility Design Reviews What is the role of inhouse staff and what value do they add to design review processes What functions are being and should be contracted to outside consultants What skills and resources do federal agencies need to provide effective oversight of design review processes What risks and liabilities do federal agencies face in outsourcing most or all of their design review functions How can new and emerging technologies be integrated into design review processes The process of acquiring a facility usually includes five phases that can be generalized as conceptual planning design procurement construction Practices and Industry and startup The contracting method used will determine whether the five phases occur in sequence or if some phases occur concurrently The contracting method can also affect who is involved at each phase A E construction contractor etc For example using the designbidbuild contract method the five phases generally occur in sequence with the A E involved in the design phase and a construction contractor in the construction phase A designbuild acquisition in contrast will use the same contractor for the design and construction phases thus allowing some phases and activities to occur concurrently Regardless of the contracting method used the acquisition of a facility will necessarily involve activities and decisions related to all five phases During the conceptual planning phase various feasibility studies are done to define the scope or statement of work based on the owner s expectations for facility performance quality cost and schedule Several alternative design solutions can be considered during this phase leading up to the selection of a single preferred approach The preferred approach may be a schematic that includes functional requirements such as square footage estimates for various functions and adjacencies or connections to functions that are desirable or required The design phase usually starts once the statement of work and preferred design approach have been developed From the schematic the design matures into final construction documents comprising the plans and specifications from which equipment procurement and construction bids can be solicited Estimated facility cost and schedule issues receive increasingly intense review during the design phase so that the owner has a high level of confidence prior to bid that the performance quality cost and schedule objectives defined during the conceptual planning phase can be met Complex facility projects usually include a procurement phase in order to expedite the purchase manufacture and delivery of longleadtime equipment such as unique process machinery large electrical and mechanical equipment and sophisticated architectural components Such equipment procurement may proceed in parallel with construction phase activities so that the owner ultimately is able to furnish longleadtime equipment to the construction contractor in a timely manner thus avoiding construction delays attributable to late equipment delivery Early in the construction phase a formal construction management plan is developed describing the intended sequence and method of construction activity as well as the relationships responsibilities and authorities of all involved parties owner user A E construction contractor specialty contractors and relevant consultants The biggest challenge during the construction phase is managing changes resulting from such sources as scope of work changes by the owner errors and omissions in the construction documents and unknown or changed site conditions The construction phase is considered complete when the owner accepts occupancy of the facility although final completion of construction may continue for months or even years until all discrepancies have been identified resolved and mutually agreed upon The startup phase sometimes called commissioning begins with occupancy of the facility by its user Building components are tested individually and then together with other components in order to measure and compare their performance against the original design criteria Facility operation and maintenance plans are implemented tested and refined as appropriate During the last 20 years change has been particularly pronounced with Downsizing of Facility regard to how corporate and government owners manage the acquisition Engineering Organizations of facilities and other projects As noted by TBR in a 1997 white paper Virtually all major firms have reduced the size and scope of work performed by engineering organizations Many firms are drifting because they are uncertain about the appropriate size and role of their inhouse capital projects organization Nearly every owner s engineering and project management organization in the U S has been reorganized sometimes repeatedly without achieving a satisfactory result in many cases 2 Since 1970 owner engineering downsizing has resulted in increased use of contractors to perform design and construction functions Graphs published by TBR based on data compiled by Independent Project 2 The Business Stake in Effective Project Systems Washington D C TBR 1997 Analysis IPA of Reston VA for more than 2 000 projects from a variety of industries show a decline in the percentage of major projects designed by owners inhouse staff from about 30 percent during 19701975 to about 25 percent during 19811985 to less than 10 percent after 1991 Many owners originally identified the project definition activity as a core competency 3 However IPA s data indicate that project definition too is increasingly being outsourced Data compiled through 1997 by CII closely correlates with TBR data 4 Fortunately an increasingly competitive productive sophisticated and capable facility design and construction industry is capable and willing to take on this increased workload Unfortunately this trend has not reduced owners overall engineering costs as a percentage of TPC 5 The engineering share of TPC has increased over the past 20 years from 13 to 20 percent The interpretation of this increase is controversial It is not clear if the increase reflects an increased cost of outsourced engineering or simply the cost of increased intensity of engineering required by today s technologydriven projects and more sophisticated design and construction practices Since 1993 federal regulations have been modified to allow agencies Contracting Methods greater flexibility and choice in the contract methods used for acquiring facilities Downsizing and the increased outsourcing of design and construction services have provided the impetus for selecting methods other than the traditional designbidbuild contract method Although there are many variations current practice recognizes four basic categories of contract types that apply to several facility acquisition systems general contract construction management designbuild and program management 3 Core competency is defined as an essential skill that should be retained within the organization in order to perform effectively 4 Benchmarking and Metrics Summary for 1997 Benchmarking and Metrics Committee Austin Texas The University of Texas at Austin 1998 5 TPC is defined as the sum total of all costs associated with a project s planning development design construction outfitting and startup not including land costs Page 12 GAO GGD00172R Study on Facility Design Reviews General Contract Approach Construction Management Approach DesignBuild Contract Approach The general contract approach assumes that the owner contracts individually for all engineering and construction services required to acquire a facility This is the traditional approach that most largescale owners both public and private used to design and construct their facilities until the relatively recent growth of interest in outsourcing of design and construction services It is illustrative of the designbidbuild contract method used by federal agencies Under this approach the owner manages individual contracts with all design engineering and construction service providers implying that the owner must also manage all interfaces between service providers Interface management becomes critical because assessment of accountability for problems incurred during the project s evolution is difficult due to the variety and separation of individual contracts To succeed such a process requires a relatively large and experienced facility design engineering and management staff within the owner s organization in order to protect the owner s interests Under the construction management approach the owner contracts with an outside firm to manage the construction of a project The construction manager CM may function either as an agency CM or as an atrisk CM Agency CM The owner holds all individual construction contracts and the CM functions as the construction contract administrator acting on behalf of the owner and rendering an account of activities The CM is typically not responsible for construction means and methods nor does the CM guarantee construction cost time or quality Atrisk CM The actual construction work is performed by trade contractors under contract to the CM who then becomes responsible to the owner for construction means and methods and delivery of the completed facility within the owner s scope of work for cost time and quality Under this approach the owner typically retains responsibility for managing all preconstruction A E services and therefore must address all interface issues between service providers The designbuild contract approach represents a much larger step toward outsourcing of traditional owner functions than occurs with the abovedescribed CM contract Under this approach an owner prepares a project scope definition and then engages a single entity that will provide all services necessary to complete the design and construct the facility Generally the scope definition package represents a design that is between 15 and 35 percent complete although variations may begin much earlier often with a performance specification or much later with perhaps a 65 percent design package Project success under this approach is primarily dependent on the owner s ability to produce a comprehensive welldefined and unambiguous scope of work upon which all subsequent designbuild activity will be based Once the designbuild contract has been awarded changes to owner requirements will generally incur heavy penalties to the project cost and schedule The owner is therefore well advised to ensure that preparation of the project scope definition package accurately and clearly expresses expectations for project performance quality cost and schedule Use of the designbuild approach for project delivery is growing dramatically in both public and private organizations NAVFAC GSA and USPS have become particularly strong proponents of this approach but not without controversy The program management contract method represents the ultimate step in outsourcing of the owner s project management functions The program manager PM is engaged by the owner to exercise oversight of the entire facility delivery process for a multitude of projects Similar to the construction management approach the PM can serve in either an agency PM or atrisk capacity Program Management Contract Approach Owner as a Smart Buyer American business has regained its competitive edge by reengineering its business practices to improve their effectiveness and in the process downsize their inhouse staff However competitive pressures caused many organizations to approach staff downsizing without adequate planning Mistakes were made reductions were insufficient or too extensive or made in the wrong area The loss of technical competence through downsizing was sufficiently pervasive that FFC in conjunction with TBR and the NAVFAC conducted the Government Industry Forum on Capital Facilities and Core Competencies in March 1998 A fundamental finding of this forum was that owner facilities engineering organizations need to identify and retain core competencies the essential technical and managerial skills that cannot be outsourced without serious risk to an organization s ability to conceive and acquire necessary facilities The forum participants recognized the advisability of the owner performing as a smart buyer of outsourced services A smart buyer is one who retains an inhouse staff capable of understanding the organization s business or mission its requirements its customer needs and who can translate those needs and requirements into corporate direction or mission accurately defining the technical services to be contracted evaluating the quality performance effectiveness and value of technical work performed by contractors and managing the interface between technical service contractors and the owner s lineofbusiness managers who will ultimately benefit from services provided These functions are intrinsic to the entire facility acquisition process and underscore the need for the owner s inhouse staff to be intimately involved in these aspects of the process particularly the leadership role It should be intuitive that poor planning and design practices result in Cost Implications of Facility Acquisition Practices increased TPC These cost growth drivers include construction change orders required to correct errors and omissions in the design documents ownerdriven construction change orders required to incorporate desirable features overlooked during design inefficient construction resulting from a failure to incorporate constructionenhancing features during design rework resulting from unclear construction documents standby costs incurred while construction is either stopped or slowed to incorporate changes litigation delayed completion of the facility i e lost business revenue staff standby nonproductive capital investment costs and a poorly performing facility Numerous research reports have been published characterizing cost growth resulting from poor planning and design practices The following are a few of

engineering costs average 20 percent of TPC in addition to design costs discussed above includes planning development and project management costs Project rework costs average 12 4 percent of TPC Eighty percent of this rework results from errors and omissions in the design documents The remaining 20 percent results from poor construction practices Fifty percent of construction change orders result from errors in the design documents directly related to improper interfaces between design disciplines civil structural architectural electrical and mechanical These change order costs contribute anywhere from 0 8 to 3 4 percent of TPC Comprehensive review of project document development during the design phase of acquisition should cost from 0 2 to 0 5 percent of TPC Properly done i e using best practices discussed later in this study such activity should drive down the cost of construction change orders by an average of 3 percent of TPC To evaluate the value of thorough concept definition a CIIled review of 62 projects compared final TPC against the estimated TPC at time of project approval for construction The 21 projects with the highest degree of definition averaged 4 percent cost underrun The middle 21 projects averaged 2 percent cost underrun The 21 projects with the lowest definition averaged 16 percent cost overrun Indirect costs the business impact costs discussed above are highly variable and very difficult to estimate but are potentially huge An orderofmagnitude estimate would be 815 percent of TPC Research conducted by Redichek Associates an A E firm specializing in outsourced design review indicates that the single biggest source of construction change orders approximately 50 percent is errors in the design documents directly related to improper interfaces between design disciplines civil structural architectural electrical and mechanical Redichek s cost for conducting the discipline interface design review is approximately 0 1 percent of TPC with a resultant reduction of rework cost ranging from 0 8 to 3 4 percent of TPC The estimated payback ratio here ranges from 8 to 34 saved for every dollar invested in a discipline 8

GGD00172R Study on Facility Design Reviews Effective Design Review Processes FFC Conclusions interface design review activity The implication of these statistics is that opportunity exists to significantly reduce TPC by conducting an effective design review process The potential savings range from a minimum of 3 percent to as much as 20 percent and even higher when indirect savings are taken into account Intuitively good design review practices result in the preparation of more comprehensive and accurate construction documents which in turn result in lower project construction costs Areas of savings include less rework on the part of the construction contractor fewer change orders for correction of design errors or omissions and the cost of belatedly adding project upgrade features that should have been addressed in the original design By reducing changes that are required during the construction phase good design review practices also generate significant indirect cost savings by avoiding costs associated with loss of productivity during constructiondelayed facility startup and litigation During the 1980s and 1990s a number of business practice studies were conducted by construction trade associations professional societies and academic groups to better understand which practices produced better results in terms of facility performance quality cost and schedule These studies concluded that quality design yields buildings that perform well throughout their service lives 11 Quality design resulted when all interested parties owner user A E construction contractor and specialty consultants in the facility acquisition process worked together in an intense collaborative complex and multiphased process beginning with conceptual planning and concluding after the startup phase These business practice studies also found that decisions made during the conceptual planning phase will establish initial constraints limiting future design flexibility These early decisions thus have a disproportionately greater influence on a facility s ultimate performance quality cost and schedule than decisions made later in the process The conceptual planning phase should therefore be the phase when the review of designs is most intense with the primary focus upon ensuring the appropriateness accuracy and thoroughness of the owner s expectations regarding facility performance quality cost and schedule This will be especially true when using the designbuild and program management contract methods when 11 Improving the Design Quality of Federal Buildings NRC Committee on Improving the Design Quality of Federal Buildings Building Research Board Washington D C National Academy Press 1989 Page 17 GAO GGD00172R Study on Facility Design Reviews the owner s involvement in design reviews declines after the conceptual planning phase If design review activity during the conceptual planning phase has resulted in a clear scope of work regarding the owner s expectations design reviews during the design phase are greatly simplified Those parties involved should focus upon ensuring that the evolving facility design incorporates high standards of professional engineering practice with regard to architectural civil structural electrical and mechanical systems and their interfaces Formal reviews may be scheduled periodically during the design phase at approximately the 35 60 90 and or 100 percent design completion milestones although these milestones may vary significantly depending on the individual project s size and complexity Such structured formality helps ensure the widest possible participation of interested parties during the review including specialists and consultants who bring expertise in such areas as value engineering constructability biddability 12 operability maintainability and environmental compliance During the procurement phase the review of designs can continue to contribute to overall project success by monitoring progress made in ordering the various items of longleadtime equipment It is not unusual for suppliers to detect errors in the ordering specifications or to make substitution recommendations for either greater economy or performance enhancement The review team should evaluate the impact of these changes on facility performance quality cost and schedule It is almost inevitable during the construction phase that scope of work changes by the owner errors and omissions in the plans unknown or changed site conditions and creative initiatives on the part of construction staff will result in recommended changes to the facility design Design reviews in this phase should focus on assessing the impact and advisability of changes on facility performance quality cost and schedule Design reviews should continue into the startup phase At this juncture it is important to document the results achieved by conducting what is commonly referred to as a postoccupancy evaluation whose purpose is to record lessons learned for future reference Facility performance quality cost and schedule actually achieved should be objectively measured and compared with the owner s original expectations Lessons learned during In biddability reviews procurement specialists look for conflicts errors omissions and lack of clarity in the construction documents that could create confusion on the part of prospective equipment suppliers or construction contractors Page 18 GAO GGD00172R Study on Facility Design Reviews the five facility acquisition phases concerning design strengths and weaknesses should be recorded for use in improving future similar project activities And perhaps most important the facility users subjective satisfaction with both the acquisition process as well as the completed facility should be noted Based on industry research by CII NRC FFC and similar organizations interviews conducted for this study and the author s experience it can be concluded that an effective design review process will be structured to address all of the topics included in table I 1 Topic Key question to be addressed Owner satisfaction Does the constructed facility meet the owner s expectations as originally defined by the project scope definition or statement of work i e performance characteristics architectural statement level of quality cost schedule and any relevant ownerpublished standards and or policies Sound professional practice Is the approach taken in each of the specialty areas architectural civil mechanical and electrical commensurate with professional standards Code compliance Does the design comply with all applicable codes such as fire protection life safety and access Architectural statement Is the overall presentation representative of established architectural standards Value engineering Are there any less expensive methods or materials that could be used in the design without impacting project quality or performance or lifecycle costs Biddability Are the construction documents sufficiently clear and comprehensive so construction contractors will have no difficulty developing an accurate bid with minimal allowance for contingency Constructability Does the design impose any unnecessarily difficult or impossible demands on the construction contractor Operability Does design of the facility operating systems ensure ease and efficiency of operation during the facility s useful lifetime Maintainability Does the facility design allow for easy and costeffective maintenance and repair over the useful life of the facility Lifecycle engineering Does the design represent the most effective balance of cost to construct cost to start up cost to operate and maintain and perhaps most important the user s cost to perform the intended function for which the facility is being acquired over the useful life of the facility Postoccupancy evaluation Based on a review of the construction startup and ongoing functioning of the facility could any unexpected difficulty have been avoided by a different design approach Source Federal Facilities Council Technical Report 139 Federal facilities comprise a portfolio of significant durable assets that have been acquired to support specific functions and missions and the Practices in Federal general conduct of the government

major player with over 265 million of construction activity in planning design or construction as of 1999 At the other end of the spectrum are the truly capitalintensive agencies such as the Department of the Navy with a 2 5 billion annual construction budget As missions priorities and situations change agencies may experience wide fluctuations in the scope and budget for their facility acquisition programs For example a recent program to upgrade federal courthouses around the country has added billions of dollars to GSA s construction activity DOS is facing a similar situation Following the 1998 bombings of embassies in Africa legislation requiring rapid and extensive upgrade of embassy security features worldwide was enacted which could require several billion dollars to execute Given the size of the government s expenditures on facilities it is important that federal agencies have effective design review processes that result in buildings that perform well throughout their service lives Like private sector corporations federal agencies facilities engineering staffs have been considerably downsized in the past 1015 years A 1987 report of FFC noted that due to budget cuts agencies have had to reduce the number of project managers design reviewers inspectors and field supervisors they employ Procurement specialists trained primarily in contract negotiation and review rather than design and construction have been playing increasingly greater roles in facilities development 13 The federal downsizing trend accelerated after 1991 as a result of a changed global environment a shift in focus toward smaller and more costeffective government and a number of legislative initiatives In the nine federal agencies that responded to the questionnaire associated with this FFC report facilities engineering staffs have been reduced on the order of 20 to 65 percent with the average at about 50 percent As a consequence of the loss of technical staff particularly architects and engineers federal agencies are increasingly outsourcing design and constructionrelated functions Downsizing of Federal Facilities Engineering Organizations DesignReviewRelated Trends in Nine Federal Agencies The FFC s Standing Committee on Organizational Performance and Metrics developed a twopart questionnaire focused on design review processes and distributed it to FFC sponsor agencies Part one was sent to senior facilities engineering program directors at the headquarters level and focused on agencywide policy issues Part two was sent to randomly selected project managers at the field activity level and focused on 13 On the Responsibilities of Architects and Engineers and Their Clients in Federal Facilities Development NRC Committee on ArchitectEngineer Responsibilities Building Research Board Washington D C National Academy Press 1994 Page 20 GAO GGD00172R Study on Facility Design Reviews How Are Agency Facility Engineering Functions Organized to Carry Out Their Missions What Has Been the Extent of Downsizing on Agency Facility Engineering Organizations How Are Agency Facilities Engineering Organizations Responding to Mitigate the Impacts of Downsizing individual project review issues The nine federal agencies that answered the questionnaires were ANG DOE DOS GSA IHS NASA NIH NAVFAC and VA The FFC report included a summary and analysis of questionnaires returned by each of these agencies that described the agency s design review practices at the time of the study The following discussion compares and contrasts the responses contained in the 44 questionnaires that were returned by the 9 federal agencies listed above There is no single organizational model for federal agency facilities engineering organizations DOE s facilities are governmentowned but contractoroperated Some agencies like the VA have moved to fieldbased design review and a mix of fieldbased and headquartersbased project management Others like NASA have a centralized program policy and oversight office with all program and project management functions conducted at the field activity level The majority of the responding agencies maintain multiple regional project execution offices Seven of the nine responding agencies facility engineering organizations experienced significant downsizing between 1994 and 1999 on the order of 20 to 50 percent reduction of inhouse staff positions the VA s reduction has been estimated at 65 percent As of August 1999 only DOS and ANG have been able to maintain a relatively stable situation with regard to staff size During the early stages of downsizing the responding agencies simply tried to do more with less However this adaptation became untenable at a certain point Agencies then began to reengineer their facility engineering processes and practices Intensity of this reengineering varies among the responding agencies reflecting the fact that the speed and extent of downsizing has varied greatly from one agency to another Impactreducing strategies reported by various agencies include the following Augmenting inhouse staffing voids through personal service contracts Personal service contracts allow agencies to add contractor staff to inhouse staff on a temporary basis to fill voids in specific disciplines or to address unusual peaks in workload Procurement policies vary among agencies with regard to allowing use of personal services contracts Outsourcing functions previously accomplished inhouse Nearly all facility acquisition functions except agency policy development and oversight have been considered for outsourcing by one agency or another Reducing the intensity of oversight activities such as design review and construction inspection by either contracting such functions to third parties or by including the functions within the scope of the design and or construction primary contracts Eliminating some activities entirely One NAVFAC field office reported that it has eliminated formal design reviews on many smaller projects holding A Es responsible for instituting a selfreview process Similarly a GSA region reported that it generally only requires a single formal progress review during design Using project delivery contracting schemes that shift more responsibility for design and construction oversight to the contractor such as designbuild construction management and program management Indeed NAVFAC reports that designbuild is now the favored contracting strategy and the traditional designbidbuild strategy has become the least favored Why and How Do Federal Risk management compliance with user expectations and reductions of Agencies Approach the Practice change orders were cited as the primary reasons for conducting design of Design Review reviews The least cited reason was to maintain inhouse core competencies All nine responding agencies report participation in a design review process Significant differences were noted however as follows All responding agencies reported that they participated in design reviews although not at every field office a few field offices of decentralized agency engineering organizations reported no or minimal design reviews they rely on A Es to selfreview their work Also the degree to which agencies and their field activities varied the intensity of the design review process between simple and complex projects varied greatly from one agency to another Design review functions identified as having the greatest valueadded were scope and budget compliance constructability and compliance with client design guides Functions identified as adding the least value were the discipline reviews architectural electrical mechanical and structural although the responses did not support the idea that these functions could be dropped from the review process without risk Nearly all responding agencies reported conducting formal design reviews at the 30 and 90 percent project design milestones Only two NASA and GSA reported conducting formal reviews routinely earlier than the 30 percent milestone The primary criteria used to determine the intensity of design review are project value complexity and the project delivery method Conversely these criteria had little impact on the decision to review with inhouse or outsourced resources That decision rested primarily on inhouse staff availability When elements of design review are outsourced all responding agencies still use inhouse staff to review project scope and budget compliance The most consistently outsourced elements included constructability value engineering and compliance with building codes Nearly all responding agencies exploit technology tools to support their design review activities including computeraided or assisted design software Internet and Intranet communication links and computer software word processing and project management programs Fewer than half of the agencies measure performance of their design review processes How Have Federal Agencies Eight of the nine responding agencies reported that they have changed Changed Their Approach to their approach to design reviews since 1994 The primary reasons cited for Design Review change are staff downsizing changes in contract methods and business process reengineering The most frequently reported changes included consolidation of agency design guides and standards for simplification increased outsourcing of either parts or all of the design review activity exploitation of technology to assist the process and reduced frequency of formal design reviews Several questions related to outsourcing of design review functions Opinions and experience on this issue were varied and no conclusions could be reached from the data provided The following were typical comments Outsourcing results in a loss of core design capability This in turn results in a lack of ability to be a Smart Buyer At some point we wouldn t even have enough expertise to hire a contractor to conduct design reviews Outsourcing poses no risk as long as the contractors are liable for performance Outsourcing poses a very significant risk particularly on renovation type work And it is very difficult to have technically competent contractors in specialty areas Outsourcing is our present way of doing business and we have experienced little risk Looking to the future about onethird of the responding agencies reported that they are considering further outsourcing of design review functions During the course of interviews and an extensive literature search a Interesting Initiatives number of innovative practices were noted that may have broader implications These practices are discussed below Partnering and Teambuilding Although this practice is achieving widespread recognition some Training programs have proven more effective than others USACE and CII have both been recognized for their particular programs and both offer formal training Inhouse Training Programs Agencies have developed inhouse training programs specializing in program and project management practices for federal agencies Among the oldest are schools run by USACE and NAVFAC More recently NASA has developed two 1week short courses of facility engineering management practices Review Comment USACE s latest software program used for documenting collecting Documentation distributing and achieving design review comments is called DR CHEKS It runs on a desktop computer and uses the Internet for communication among design review participants Perhaps most important it has features to aid followup of actions taken in response to review comments which is a particularly troublesome area Project Management Center of GSA recently established the GSA Project Management Center of Expertise Expertise The center has been staffed by GSA s most senior and competent project managers to serve two functions Actively manage all of GSA s uniquely large complex or highvisibility projects regardless of location Provide mentoring counseling and training services in the area of project management in support of all of GSA s regional offices International Standards Some large A E firms have secured ISO 9000 certification as a quality Organization ISO 9000 control activity Among federal agencies several USACE s district offices Certification have received ISO 9000 certification for their design and construction programs Other agencies including NASA and NIH are working toward ISO 9000 certification for their facility engineering activities 14 It should be noted that ISO 9000 does not guarantee a quality product Rather it guarantees that the process that produces the product good or bad has been carefully structured documented and measured Organizations have 14 Subsequent to the issuance of the FFC report NASA received ISO 9000 certification for its headquarters office and each of its centers Also NIH received certification for the design and construction branch of its Division of Engineering Services Page 24 GAO GGD00172R Study on Facility Design Reviews Conceptual or Advance Planning Design Review Lessons Learned A E Historical Performance Database NIH Contractor Performance System found that the process of securing ISO 9000 registration has been a valuable experience in understanding just what they do and how they go about it Most projects that fail to meet their planned objectives do so because of faulty or inadequate predesign development CII has recently developed a comprehensive preproject planning approach that allows organizations to measure whether they have adequately addressed all predesign requirements CII also has developed a training module intended to assist organizations in adopting this recommended approach to preproject planning Problems identified in the design review process can become a powerful tool to improve performance VA uses a method of documenting and publicizing such lessons learned in an innovative program called ProCATS Its purpose is to identify recurring problems that result in change orders claims and delays and then to take positive steps to avoid such problems in the future The system is the first of its kind in the federal government and was a 1996 winner of the Vice President s Hammer Award USACE has for many years maintained a database containing historical evaluations of A E performance on past projects This database the ACASS can be queried by any federal agency interested in a particular A E s past performance NIH has developed a multiple agency shared file system that allows all authorized users to have access to the completed contractor performance evaluations of all subscribing agencies via the Internet A separate module for each subscribing agency is developed with a unique URL allowing each agency control of agency data and access authority Planned future enhancements include automated construction and A E forms electronic storage of contractors rebuttal and comments electronic and encrypted transmittal of evaluations to contractor and ad hoc reporting During the course of the study a literature search was conducted industry experts and practitioners were consulted and federal agencies were Valueadded of Design surveyed The findings of this report as they relate to the original questions posed about the valueadded of design review processes and the role of facilities owners are addressed in this segment Design reviews are an essential component of the facility acquisition What is the Valueadded of process An effective design review process helps to unify and align all Design Review Processes interested parties to a common objective and integrate their knowledge Page 25 GAO GGD00172R Study on Facility Design Reviews experience and skills throughout all phases of the facility acquisition process conceptual planning design procurement construction and startup In the end effective review of designs maximizes the probability that a business requirement will be successfully supported by a facility that was conceived designed constructed and placed into operation efficiently and effectively Effective design review practices result in the preparation of more comprehensive and accurate design and construction documents which in turn result in lower project construction costs Areas of savings include less rework on the part of the construction contractor fewer change orders to the owner for correction of design errors or omissions and the cost of belatedly adding project upgrade features that should have been addressed in the original design By reducing changes required during the construction phase effective design review practices also generate significant indirect cost savings by avoiding costs associated with loss of productivity during constructiondelayed facility startup and litigation The nine federal agencies that responded to FFC s questionnaire indicated that they currently measure the valueadded of design review processes primarily from a broad context Their insight is both subjective is the user reasonably happy with the completed facility as well as objective how close did the completed facility come to the original cost and schedule objectives Sufficient industry research has been conducted in recent years to identify metrics that can be used to measure both the efficiency and the effectiveness of each phase of the facility acquisition process and compare the results to established benchmarks The extent to which individual federal agencies currently take such measurements and analyze results varies widely HowDo andHow Can Federal Agencies Measure the Valueadded What Is the Role of Inhouse Staff and What Value Do They AddtoDesignReview Processes Within most federal agencies acquiring facilities is a means to support the agency s mission rather than the mission itself The agency s inhouse facility engineering staff exist to support the agency s mission First and foremost the inhouse staff should be able to identify facility requirements in the context of their impact on the agency s mission success and in so doing to act as a smart buyer The staff should be capable of leading a strategic planning process involving representatives of the agency s facility user community where give and take decisions are made balancing the facility s ultimate performance cost and schedule During the tactical facility acquisition phase inhouse facility engineering staff should be capable of providing the overall process leadership ensuring that all activities proceed in the best interest of the owner What Functions Are Being and Should Be Contracted to Outside Consultants Toward this end the owner s interests are best served if the inhouse staff can also perform in the role of a smart buyer of the necessary technical services A smart buyer is one who retains the requisite technical knowledge to accurately define the technical services needed recognizes value during the acquisition of such technical services and can evaluate the quality of services ultimately provided Individual and often uncontrollable circumstances have resulted in nearly all facility engineering functions from conceptual planning to project startup being contracted to outside consultants at one time or another Today s general practice among federal agencies is to outsource design development and to a lesser extent certain specialized technical review functions such as shop drawing reviews value engineering and constructability As long as sufficient skills are retained inhouse to meet the smart buyer approach discussed above there does not appear to be any greater risk from contracting out a broader range of design review functions including such services as construction document discipline reviews and code compliance checks so long as such functions are widely available from a competitive commercial marketplace The exception occurs when complex projects include unique and specialized features of high mission relevance and limited skill availability in the commercial marketplace examples would include NASA wind tunnels VA medical research facilities and highsecurity military facilities Agencies are well advised to retain such unique specialized skills inhouse as core competencies with design review a primary inhouse responsibility Industryrelated research and the author s interviews with public and What Skills and Resources private sector practitioners suggest that agencies should retain the Do Federal Agencies Need capabilities inhouse to to Provide Effective OversightofDesignReview define facility requirements in relation to the agency s mission assess facilityrelated mission impacts and conduct facilityrelated strategic Processes planning activities lead and conduct teaming activities involving participants from various interested parties owner user A E construction contractor specialty consultants etc develop implement and maintain overall policy and direction of the agency s facility engineering function and perform as a smart buyer of outsourced technical services The risks and liabilities will vary depending on whether an agency What Risks and Liabilities maintains the inhouse capabilities to perform the design reviewrelated Do Federal Agencies Face functions listed above If an agency does not retain such inhouse in Outsourcing Most or All resources and capabilities agencies risk the following consequences of Their Design Review Consultant access to agency decision makers may be limited resulting in Functions difficulty understanding the owner s project performance expectations Project schedule may be compromised at key decision points due to lack of owner insight A design review process with little or no owner participation may become ineffective without the owner being aware of the developing process deterioration An owner with little or no participation in design reviews is less likely to become aware of any breakdowns in the process the owner mayfind out toolate toremedy the problem or tosave the project schedule and this may result in cost overruns Consultants may find it difficult to communicate with owner staff regarding technical issues and problem solving In the case of unique or unusual facilities consultants may have limited access to unique skills potentially resulting in na ve and inappropriate technical solutions How Can New and Emerging Technologies Be Integrated Into Design Review Processes The ongoing revolution in information technology and communications offers unlimited opportunities to improve design review processes Examples range from relatively simple practices such as effective use of audio and video teleconferencing to improve meeting flexibility to emerging technologies using holographic projection techniques to create threeand fourdimensional models of project designs in order to visualize the impact of proposed changes The Internet and computeraided design and drafting can be used for fast comprehensive paperless communication between reviewers managers and A Es Benchmarking offers one tool to identify which technologies offer the most return for the investment made Agencies can identify similar organizations that have successfully incorporated desirable technologies and adopt those practices that offer significant improvements in process cost savings time or resources Agencies can also consider joining any of the many trade and professional organizations that assist their membership in identifying and implementing appropriate technologybased practices It is important to recognize that some of the technology practices will cause major changes to established routines require new equipment and software and require mastering new sets of skills Effective design review processes require work some of it obvious and some of it quite subtle The following list of 18 best practices relies heavily on research conducted by CII TBR NRC FFC and similar organizations The best practices are organized into five categories related to the role of the owner teamwork and collaboration advance planning process and benchmarking 1 Be a smart buyer Facility acquisition processes including review of Role of the Owner designs work best when the owner has sufficient inhouse expertise to qualify as a smart buyer A smart buyer is one who retains an inhouse staff that understands the organization s mission its requirements and its customer needs and who can translate those needs and requirements into a corporate or strategic direction A smart buyer also retains an inhouse staff that includes technical experts who can articulate the nature of technical services being bought recognize good value during the negotiation of such services and evaluate the quality of the services as they are provided 2 Develop a scope of work that clearly and accurately defines the owner s expectations regarding facility cost schedule performance and quality The owner s standards more than those of any other entity involved in the acquisition process will set the tone for all aspects of design review activity The owner s scope of work should be used as the yardstick against which to measure performance 3 Avoid the temptation to micromanage design reviews A Es are selected based on their experience and expertise they should be given wide latitude to bring that expertise to fruition 4 Use teambuilding and partnering techniques to build good working Teamwork and Collaboration and communicative relationships among the participants as well as to align all participants toward common objectives and expectations 5 Ensure that all interested parties participate in design reviews from the planning and design phases so that all perspectives are represented as the design evolves Broad participation creates early project endorsement or buyin reducing the potential of later disagreement or need for changes At a minimum involve representatives of the owner the user the A E construction management staff maintenance and operations staff and special staff such as procurement safety and Advance Planning fire protection Where possible and appropriate include the construction contractor permitting agency staff and independent specialists for value engineering and independent review Err on the side of excess participation it is costeffective protection against subsequent unexpected and expensive fixes and oversights 6 Use the same A E throughout the facility acquisition process to maximize continuity and allow participants to build and apply their experience baseline Using the same A E for conceptual planning detailed design construction support engineering services and startup takes advantage of the A E s intimate understanding of both the owner and his project needs and supports continuity of personnel involved 7 Use senior experienced personnel who understand the relationship of a facility to meeting the agency s overall mission and who can effectively evaluate the evolving design and guide the review process 8 Participants should commit for the duration of the activity to ensure continuity Changing participants from any of the organizations involved in reviewing the design can disrupt the work flow and threaten the stability of good teaming relationships 9 Participate in a design awards program in order to recognize and motivate excellence Nothing succeeds like success Recognition of a job well done gives visibility to a successful process and motivates all of the participants to continually improve 10 Focus attention on the review of designs during the conceptual planning and design phases where the ability to influence the ultimate functionality and cost of the project is the greatest Effective design review processes start out being very intensive and proactive with an intensity that declines through the procurement construction and startup phases of the acquisition process 11 Do not start the final stage of design preparation of the construction plans and specifications until the preliminary engineering has been completed To do otherwise could significantly slow the overall design activity due to frequent interruption and rework caused by incomplete project scope definition 12 Tailor the design review approach to project specifics Project Process complexity cost mission criticality visibility method of contracting Page 30 GAO GGD00172R Study on Facility Design Reviews Benchmarking and schedule are just a few of the variables that can drive aspects of the design review approach such as frequency intensity and reliance on outsourced experts and consultants 13 Keep up the pace to maintain momentum and keep the facility acquisition process on schedule The review of designs at each phase of the process should not impede progress toward a completed facility A stopstart or prolonged process impacts the acquisition in many ways perhaps the most critical being the increased potential that organizations will reassign participants 14 Pay special attention to the civil structural electrical and mechanical interfaces Historically 3050 percent of all construction change orders result from interference fit problems between trades Is the power supply appropriate to the specified mechanical equipment Does the HVAC Heating Ventilating and Air Conditioning ducting interfere with structural members 15 Exploit technology The technological revolution has provided many tools to enhance design review processes including computeraided design threedimensional modeling data collection and distribution software programs and rapid communications systems including the Internet 16 Conduct a postoccupancy evaluation to develop a lessonslearned document for future reference After facility startup the design review team should document objective results how did final cost and schedule compare to planned as well as subjective results is the user pleased with facility performance The postoccupancy evaluation should also relate approaches taken during the various phases of the facility acquisition process with the final results 17 Measure results achieved by design review processes in order to assess their level of performance A process cannot be managed if it is not measured Successful benchmarking requires an organization to identify relevant performance characteristics measure them and compare results against either established industrial norms or against similar measured characteristics of other organizations recognized for their excellence 18 Document both unusually good and bad performance for future reference Even better find a way to share such information with other organizations and federal agencies Enclosure II Comments from the Director Federal Facilities Council See footnote 14 on p 24 Enclosure III Comments from Mr Ralph
