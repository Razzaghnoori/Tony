 This story it s uh it s happened about two years ago and uh uh my wife Elizabeth I have a son Jack who s ten years old a son Nick who s eight and uh Alex who s five And we re trying to make a decision whether to buy a beach place beach house or a lake house or a mountain house And we d read this newspaper on a Sunday morning you know you get these articles about um you know advertisements about these beautiful mountain mountain lake places and we thought Gosh this is great you know it s a combination of both it s a it s a a mountain place with this beautiful lake that surrounds this this mountain So um we called and uh this guy answered the phone and he s with the development company it s up in the mountains it s near uh uh Lake Lure And uh the guy says Come on up and he says Wha what will you be driving and uh we said Well a a car or a van you know Do you is the van four wheel drive and I said Well no it s not and he says Well you know some of this gets real rugged you know up here and uh it s not fully developed the you know you can look at some of the lots if you bring your van you can just look at some of the lots that are developed you know so it ll be you can drive right up to it So um we thought about that and we thought Well let s just take the truck because I have a four wheel drive truck it s got the king cab and we put all the kids in the back smashed them in that little king cab part and got in the truck and drove And we drove about two hours and it was getting pretty hot you know kind of kind of a miserable ride and we get up and uh get up to Lake Lure into this development pull into the development you have to drive like meandering through this this hillside and we get up to this trailer and uh we thought Well this is you know we thought Well we d be able to see houses and uh you know you could tell this development was not that far along So we talked to the development guy and he he kind of shows us a map a real rough map of the area and uh so tells us Well you know here here are the key key kind of sites and you re looking for what And we said Well we want a a house that s kind of in the mountains and that looks on a lake like you had in the newspaper And he goes Well we got we got SOME of those and I said Well in the newspaper it says you have all your houses are overlooking lakes and he goes Well you know and he could tell we had driven a long way just to you know you know just to see some really kind of rugged area and we he knew exactly what we wanted at that point He says Well here s there s one lot left that actually overlooks this water and it s on a hilltop and uh you know kind of drew it out on this paper map and then we drove out there Well we start driving in this truck you know I have a fairly large truck and we re driving and the road s at first paved and then we re driving along and then it goes to stone gravel and then pretty much we keep going and it s like dirt turns into a dirt road and then at the end of this road probably the last twenty minutes we re driving over tree stumps to get to this location on this map And uh we finally get up there It took us twenty minutes of rough driving in four wheel drive to get to the top of this hill And we get get there and we literally had to park between trees that they d just cut And uh they d just clear cut I don t know if you know ever heard what clear cutting is Clear cutting is you cut the trees down but you leave the trees there then you bring a bulldozer and push them off later Well they hadn t pushed any of these off so there s these trees on top of this hill And I kind of drove to the peak of this hill and we could see down on the lake and it was kind of neat but the the the lake the hill the grade down to the lake was just unbelievable it was almost like a cliff And you know you could it was probably an eight per cent grade very steep grade So Elizabeth Like what degree More than for less than forty five degrees I mean It was about uh probably thirty degrees so pretty steep And Elizabeth ah immediately she looks at me and she goes You keep these boys here you know we ll stay and we ll kind of look around but you know um just you keep track of these guys Well Alex the youngest of course he s just so sick of being in this truck he says Get me out of here you know just Let me out I say OK everybody we re going to get out of the truck we re going to kind of look around we ll do some stuff and then we ll probably eat breakfast and then we ll go or ea we had our little bag lunches and then we ll go down to the lake And uh we get out of the truck and we walk about ten feet and I I was like walking over logs and trying to get over to a fairly clear area and all of a sudden Alex just goes Snake Snake screaming at the top of his lungs you know and it it just it was unbelievable how loud he was yelling how and I thought Oh my God he got bit by a snake Well I turn around and I go Wha what s wrong and Alex is pointing at me and I look down between my legs and there s this rattlesnake like I d stepped in this rattlesnake nest And I m standing there and I go OK everybody just calm down and you know And I stepped down on the log and then Ja Alex is freaking out just freaking out he s going Jees Dad Jees you know my go my son s cussing like I do you know I was so scared So we walk we walk away from that snake I go Oh my God I m lucky I m not dead you know they could have bit me and then you guys would have put me in a truck and hauled me twenty minutes and I I you know I probably would have died And I I m like God somebody s trying to tell me something So anyway we kind of we stayed away from the snake and we re kind of walking around and then Jack and Nick they Jack s the oldest and Nick you know is eight and uh they want to go down to the lake and Elizabeth s going No don t let them go down to the lake just it s too steep don t let them go down to the lake And uh we you know they re just saying Well what are we doing We re just going to get in the truck and then go back Let s just at least look at the lake So I said OK guys You guys can go go down to the lake just be careful And uh so they kind of walked over to the hill kind of started walking down and at a point they just had to sit on their butts and kind of slide down and the trees were all cut so they d grab trees as they were going down And um I was just watching them and I was up at the top and then I started down I d figured let them go first then I d I d go kind of behind them I was probably um I d say sixty foot behind them And um Nick was first Jack was in the middle I was at the back And Alex was with Elizabeth And Alice Alex stayed with Elizabeth and she was mad at us because we were doing this She s up at the top of the hill And um I said Nick everything OK you know he says Yeah yeah All of a sudden Nick and we still to this day do not know why he did this he stood up on this grade and started running down this hill I mean the hill s no human being could catch that kind of momentum without gravity pulling him down and he starts running and he s running and you could just see it was like there s no way he s going to recover from this And he s running trying to keep up with gravity so he s going down this hill and literally falling down the hill but instead of falling down he s running And what we didn t know was this hill came down and then there was a twenty foot cliff with a big terrace in it and then the hill kept going They d cut a terrace into the hill halfway down it you couldn t see it from the top where they drove trucks down and they d just clear cut this and down at that cliff the bottom of that cliff was twenty foot in the air literally higher than this ceiling and down at the bottom were just these little like bungee where they d cut all this brush and there s little bungee stuff sticking out And all of a sudden I just saw Nick just run and disappear off this cliff and he s just flying like the last thing I saw was him flying I go Oh my God By that time I m running down the hill just grabbing stuff like falling down the hill grabbing stuff And as I saw he hit the ground flat like on those bungees and then flipped two times He hit flat face first flipped three times I mean end over end and landed in the spread eagle backwards and by the time I came down the cliff he s just grabbing his eyes and I looked down and then I saw those bungees and I thought Oh my God he impaled his eyes and his face and his body with these bungee things uh oh my God I just flew off the cliff you know and by that time I get to him he s just he s not even breathing and I looked at him I go Nick Are you all right And I looked at his nose and his mouth and his eyelids and what he d done he d hit the ground and it was a real dusty powdery He d missed all those bungee sticks but the dust and dirt had gone in his mouth and like his nose was filled with dirt it backed up in here and under his eyelids were filled with dirt he was he goes he looked at me and he goes Uuuugggghhhh He couldn t talk He says Am I alive Am I alive I go Nick what were you doing What did you think Wha why what were you thinking to run down this hill And he goes Well I started falling and I couldn t stop myself and I figured I d rather run down hill as fast as I could and I thought that I could I could outrun it and I saw Bugs Bunny do it on T on cartoons He thought Bugs Bunny could outrun you know the speeding locomotive or and it I think his whole mind you know like when the house is falling and Bugs Bunny hops out at the last minute and then lives That s what he was thinking that s that s science that s kinetic energy in his mind Bottom line we got him back up the hill and one week later we bought a house at the beach No way somebody was trying to tell us not to do that Snakes killing our kids you know two hours it s hot it was the most miserable time And Elizabeth and I still to this day say We didn t we re lucky that we that two of us aren t dead you know from trying to buy the mountain house But that s my story
