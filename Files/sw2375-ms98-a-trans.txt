 good morning do you have a computer a personal computer yes i do i have um uh fifty megabyte hard disk on a so i got a i little you know lot of room for information i m a i m a programmer at work oh so uh but i i do all of my programming on the mainframe and i uh don t have a lot of opportunity to work on the PC except at home um hum um hum so i find it very interesting how about you um i have one uh a Wang or um sorry a Compaq portable that my son picked up at one point um hum uh without documentation so it was very cheap it s a two eighty six uh huh so it has no hard drive um hum um so that s limiting i tend to use it to log into the the mainframe at work oh that s great and then i have a a Mac that i use for graphics and do you like the Mac real well um i don t there s something about the Mac a lot of things about the Mac i don t like i don t like the size of the screen i have an old uh Plus i don t like the keyboard but i it s extremely easy to use um hum um hum and it s very good for for graphics and actually i i mean it s to the point where programs are easily readily available and inexpensive so i did my income tax on it um hum i have um uh it s not really a budget package but a a financial tracking package you know for my checkbook and stuff like that um hum i ve i ve heard a lot of wonderful things about the Mac except it does have a limitation as far as the screen goes right and i mean you can you can buy an extra screen but but it s somehow because the screen comes with it it it always looks awkward to have the two screens that s true that s very true um hum and i found uh my son is um uh second year college student and he in high school had no interest in the computer at all and so he when teachers said you know you have to type your papers at least with a Mac he was willing to sit down and type his paper and um um hum uh huh now he does play with with the the you know IBM clone um hum but um and has learned quite a bit about it and tends to use it instead of instead of instead of the Mac so even without any propaganda and stuff he he seems to have switched is he interested in computers then did this give him an interest in it other than you know using it more as or less like a word a word processing machine he uh no i mean he sees it as a tool much as i do as a tool um hum okay and um he no he s in international studies oh that sounds interesting too so he s basically you know whatever whatever the computer can do for you fine i ll learn enough to to make it work well for me but i m not gonna be a guru uh huh i understand that you have to have a certain i mean either you like them or you don t i think a lot of the people are afraid of them um hum uh are intimidated by them i guess more than anything until they get get to uh learn what they can do and and how it can work right but i think that is it is very frustrating because you know you re sure you did X so uh huh and it just doesn t work and and so you tell somebody who knows about computers and they say no you obviously didn t do that because the computer doesn t doesn t balk that s right and even even using it as much as i do you know and you d you d oh well i did that i know i did that you know and then the results come back and no you didn t they catch you every time so anyway i guess you have to have a sense a humor too when you re working with them right and talk to them and yell at them so um hum yell at them and like to choke them so many times i wanna choke mine say you re not doing what i want you to do um hum um hum but uh i i have one mainly i bought it because i m in uh taking a lot of courses along with work and it s very useful in that respect but i hope to do something more with it basically you re using it as a word processor you mean right exactly and it seems a shame to have all that equipment but uh not do anything with it but one day i hope to do more and what would you do i don t know i know there must be something more i can do with it but uh in my spare time someday i i hope to do something more with it i have a lot a ideas but putting them into work is another story um hum right right so anyway well it s been very interesting well thank you very much for calling okay have a good day bye bye okay you too bye bye
