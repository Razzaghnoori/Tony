                            Like SARS Ebola and other emerging infectious diseases antibiotic resistance in        bacteria may have a zoonotic origin  Evidence suggests that antibiotic use in        agriculture has contributed to antibiotic resistance in the pathogenic bacteria of humans        but the chain from cause to effect is long and complicated        Antibiotic use clearly selects for antibiotic resistance but how far do these effects        extend beyond the population where antibiotics are used Antibiotics and        antibioticresistant bacteria ARB are found in the air and soil around farms in surface        and ground water in wild animal populations and on retail meat and poultry  ARB are        carried into the kitchen on contaminated meat and poultry where other foods are        crosscontaminated because of common unsafe handling practices  Following        ingestion bacteria occasionally survive the formidable but imperfect gastric barrier and        colonize the gut         Patterns of colonization asymptomatic carriage and infection symptomatic carriage in        human populations provide additional evidence that ARB occasionally move from animals to        humans  The strongest evidence comes from the history of the use of antibiotics for        growth promotion in Europe After first Denmark and then the European Union banned the use        of antibiotics for growth promotion prevalence of resistant bacteria declined in farm        animals in retail meat and poultry and within the general human population         Despite the evidence linking bacterial antibiotic resistance on farms to resistance in        humans the impact of agricultural antibiotic use remains controversial  and poorly        quantified This is partly because of the complex of populationlevel processes underlying        the betweenspecies heterospecific and withinspecies hosttohost horizontal        spread of ARB To emerge as human pathogens new strains of ARB must  evolve        originating from mutations or gene transfer  spread usually horizontally among humans        or animals but occasionally heterospecifically and  cause disease        All three of these steps are complex and imperfectly understood The emergence of a new        type of resistance is a highly random event which cant be predicted accurately and may        involve multiple steps that preclude perfect understanding even after the fact Spread is        equally complicated and may obscure the origins of resistance In some cases emergence of        resistance in one bacterial species is a consequence of the emergence and spread in another        species followed by the transfer of resistance genes from one bacterial species to        another Because of the underlying complexity mathematical models are necessary to develop        theorya qualitative understanding of the underlying epidemiological processes         Theory helps researchers organize facts identify missing information design surveillance        and analyze data                     Horizontal Transmission        Theory clearly shows that the impact of agricultural antibiotic use depends on whether        resistant bacteria have high low or intermediate horizontal transmission rates in human        populations  The rate of horizontal transmission among humans is determined by the        underlying biology of the pathogen medical antibiotic use and hospital infection control        but not by agricultural antibiotic use  On the other hand a farm where multiple        antibiotics are used routinely universally and in low quantities for growth promotion is        likely to be an excellent environment for the evolution of multiple resistance factors        including some variants that might never have evolved in humans Thus even very rare        transmission resulting from agricultural antibiotics may have a medical impact by        introducing new resistant variants to the human population The epidemiology of spread in        the human population dictates how the impact of agricultural antibiotic use should be        assessed        Zoonotic pathogens such as         Campylobacter and         Salmonella  are generally regarded as having low horizontal        transmission rates in human populations While resistance in zoonotic infections should be        directly attributable to resistance in the zoonotic reservoir the impact of agricultural        antibiotic use remains controversial  Zoonotic species could acquire resistance        genes from human commensal bacteria during the infection process but this hypothesis is        difficult to test        For pathogens with high horizontal transmission rates resistant bacteria will spread        rapidly once they have emerged and prevalence will be maintained at a steady state by        horizontal transmission Thus the impact of subsequent heterospecific transmission is        limited Figure  Nevertheless one or two heterospecific transmission events could be        sufficient to cause the appearance of a highly successful ARB genotype in humans affecting        the timing nature and extent of spread within the human population  Not only are        such events difficult to trace but their impact is impossible to measure since there is        no way to know what type of resistance would have appeared and with what temporal pattern        if transfers from animals had been prevented        The case where horizontal human transmission rates are intermediate is particularly        interesting If each case in a population generates approximately one new case a situation        we call quasiepidemic transmission each instance of heterospecific transmission will        initiate a long chain of horizontal transmission that eventually burns out Quasiepidemic        transmission can amplify a relatively low amount of heterospecific transmission and        substantially increase prevalence  The effect is sustained as long as        heterospecific transmission continues A corollary is that banning agricultural antibiotic        use would have maximal benefits if horizontal transmission is quasiepidemic         Moreover the effects are most difficult to estimate because both heterospecific and        horizontal transmission must be accounted for        These principles apply to bacteria associated with outpatient antibiotic use and        communityacquired infections as well as those that are primarily hospitalacquired        Although quasiepidemic transmission would seem to be a special case it may in fact be the        rule for many hospitalacquired bacteria because it is the natural endpoint of the        interplay between economics and ecology  By spending money on hospital infection        control hospital administrators can reduce nosocomial transmission rates for resistant        bacteria For example hospitals may screen and isolate patients who are likely to be        carriers ie active surveillance and implement infectioncontrol measures but this        comes at the cost of isolating patients  Total costs are minimized by spending just        enough to eliminate or nearly eliminate the pathogen thus quasiepidemic transmission        is the economic optimum                     The Community as a Reservoir for Resistance        Horizontal transmission is further complicated by population structure such as the        movement of humans through hospitals and longterm care facilities Medical antibiotic use        and horizontal transmission rates are high in hospitals but this is counterbalanced by        short hospital stays An emerging view for hospitalacquired bacterial infections is that        persistent asymptomatic carriage plays a key role in the epidemic of resistance ARB can        asymptomatically colonize a person for years even if the number of other people infected        during a single hospital visit is less than one this number will exceed one when summed        over several hospital visits  Thus the ecological reservoir of resistance in        the community plays an important role in the increasing frequency of resistance in        hospitalacquired infections        Short hospital visits and long persistence times of ARB in people guarantee that some of        the costs associated with failed infection control are passed on to other hospitalsnew        carriers are frequently discharged from one hospital only to be admitted to another        hospital later  Thus the harm done by these ARB is borne by the whole human        population particularly all of the healthcare institutions that serve a single catchment        population In economic terms the damage caused by the carriage of ARB is a kind of        pollution        By comparing the total number of new carriers generated in the community the impacts of        agricultural antibiotic use on hospitals can be compared directly to the impact hospitals        have on each other Figure  The rate of heterospecific transmission is intrinsically        difficult to measure directly because the risk of exposure and colonization per meal is        very small Nevertheless agricultural antibiotic use may generate as many carriers as        hospitals for the simple reason that the population experiences many more meals than        hospital discharges  When agricultural and nosocomial transmission are equally rare in        the population the latter will be much easier to identify and quantify                    A Natural Experiment Glycopeptides and VancomycinResistant Enterococci        Is the impact of agricultural antibiotic use on the emergence and spread of ARB in        humans large or small relative to medical antibiotic use Put another way are farms or        hospitals bigger polluters A largescale natural experiment was conducted in the United        States and several European countries when each adopted different policies on glycopeptide        use in animals avoparcin and humans vancomycin  Many European countries        approved avoparcin for animal growth promotion in the s but the US did not        In the early s demand for vancomycin in US hospitals surged because of increasing        aminoglycoside resistance among enterococci and methicillin resistance in         Staphylococcus aureus  Physicians in US hospitals also used        oral vancomycin for some         Clostridium difficile infections  In the late s and        early s vancomycinresistant enterococci VRE emerged and spread through US        healthcare systems In Europe hospitals used less vancomycin because most enterococci        were sensitive to aminoglycosides and oral vancomycin was seldom used VRE still emerged        and spread through European hospitals but the problem has been less severe than in the US                A different pattern emerges for community prevalence of VRE VRE are rarely found        outside of hospitals in the US except for patients who have a prior history of        hospitalization Community prevalence of VRE in the US is typically less than  In        contrast community prevalence of VRE was estimated at  in Europe during the late        s including carriage by people with no history of hospitalization  In other        words the European community reservoir generated by vancomycin use in hospitals and        avoparcin use in agriculture was apparently much larger than the US community reservoir        generated only by vancomycin use in hospitals        The prevalence of VRE in the community declined after the EU banned avoparcin         Thus avoparcin is at least partly responsible for the reservoir of VRE in the European        community but how much of that reservoir came from avoparcin and how much came from        hospitals To weigh the impact we subtract the community prevalence of VRE in the US         from the community prevalence of VRE in Europe  The remainder  is        attributed to avoparcin This analysis probably underestimates the real impact because        vancomycin was used less in European than in US hospitals Thus avoparcin use in Europe        would appear to be responsible for generating a larger reservoir of VRE in the community        than US hospitals Put another way the impact of avoparcin use on European hospitals was        larger than the impact of US hospitals on one another                    Conclusion        Despite the evidence that avoparcin use has had a large impact on the emergence and        spread of VRE by increasing the reservoir of VRE in the EU some uncertainty continues to        surround the clinical significance of VRE strains of animal origin and of the zoonotic        origins of resistance in general Bacterial strains circulating in hospitalized populations        may be genetically distinct from those circulating in the general human population         Thus bacterial populations are some combination of zoonotic quasiepidemic        and epidemic strains The complexity of bacterial population biology and genetics makes it        practically impossible to trace bacteria or resistance factors from the farm to the        hospital or to directly attribute some fraction of new infections to agricultural        antibiotic use Asymptomatic carriage of resistance factors by nonfocal commensal bacteria        adds to a general risk of resistance but transfer of resistance among bacterial species is        unpredictable and difficult to quantify Until more evidence is available it is prudent        and reasonable to consider bacteria with resistance genes a general threat         Some part of the controversy over agricultural antibiotic use has been a disagreement        about how to weigh evidence and make decisions when the underlying biological processes are        complex In this case the effects of agricultural antibiotic use on human health remain        uncertain despite extensive investigation and the effects may be unknowable unprovable        or immeasurable by the empirical standards of experimental biology What should be done        when complexity makes an important publichealth effect intrinsically difficult to measure        What is an appropriate null hypothesis or its equivalent Should the same standards of        proof be used in science and sciencebased policy Where should the burden of proof        fall        Scientific assessments for policy should summarize the best state of the science        recognizing that the burdens and standards of proof are necessarily softer because of the        uncertainty that is introduced by biological complexity The best decisions weigh the        evidence in light of the inherent uncertainty The EU banned the use of antibiotics for        growth promotion based on the precautionary principle The use of the precautionary        principle was criticized by some as unscientific in this context In fact the intrinsic        problem of knowability posed by the biological complexity of the problem makes the use of        precautionary decision making particularly suitable in this arena The assumption that        plausible dangers are negligible even when it is known that such dangers are        constitutively very difficult to measure may be more unscientific than the use of        precaution
