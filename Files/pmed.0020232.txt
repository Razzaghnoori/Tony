 Like SARS Ebola and other emerging infectious diseases antibiotic resistance in bacteria may have a zoonotic origin 1 Evidence suggests that antibiotic use in agriculture has contributed to antibiotic resistance in the pathogenic bacteria of humans but the chain from cause to effect is long and complicated Antibiotic use clearly selects for antibiotic resistance but how far do these effects extend beyond the population where antibiotics are used Antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria ARB are found in the air and soil around farms in surface and ground water in wild animal populations and on retail meat and poultry 2 9 ARB are carried into the kitchen on contaminated meat and poultry where other foods are cross contaminated because of common unsafe handling practices 10 11 Following ingestion bacteria occasionally survive the formidable but imperfect gastric barrier and colonize the gut 12 Patterns of colonization asymptomatic carriage and infection symptomatic carriage in human populations provide additional evidence that ARB occasionally move from animals to humans 13 14 The strongest evidence comes from the history of the use of antibiotics for growth promotion in Europe After first Denmark and then the European Union banned the use of antibiotics for growth promotion prevalence of resistant bacteria declined in farm animals in retail meat and poultry and within the general human population 8 15 Despite the evidence linking bacterial antibiotic resistance on farms to resistance in humans the impact of agricultural antibiotic use remains controversial 16 19 and poorly quantified This is partly because of the complex of population level processes underlying the between species heterospecific and within species host to host horizontal spread of ARB To emerge as human pathogens new strains of ARB must 1 evolve originating from mutations or gene transfer 2 spread usually horizontally among humans or animals but occasionally heterospecifically and 3 cause disease All three of these steps are complex and imperfectly understood The emergence of a new type of resistance is a highly random event which can t be predicted accurately and may involve multiple steps that preclude perfect understanding even after the fact Spread is equally complicated and may obscure the origins of resistance In some cases emergence of resistance in one bacterial species is a consequence of the emergence and spread in another species followed by the transfer of resistance genes from one bacterial species to another Because of the underlying complexity mathematical models are necessary to develop theory a qualitative understanding of the underlying epidemiological processes 20 25 Theory helps researchers organize facts identify missing information design surveillance and analyze data 26 Horizontal Transmission Theory clearly shows that the impact of agricultural antibiotic use depends on whether resistant bacteria have high low or intermediate horizontal transmission rates in human populations 23 24 The rate of horizontal transmission among humans is determined by the underlying biology of the pathogen medical antibiotic use and hospital infection control but not by agricultural antibiotic use 22 On the other hand a farm where multiple antibiotics are used routinely universally and in low quantities for growth promotion is likely to be an excellent environment for the evolution of multiple resistance factors including some variants that might never have evolved in humans Thus even very rare transmission resulting from agricultural antibiotics may have a medical impact by introducing new resistant variants to the human population The epidemiology of spread in the human population dictates how the impact of agricultural antibiotic use should be assessed Zoonotic pathogens such as Campylobacter and Salmonella are generally regarded as having low horizontal transmission rates in human populations While resistance in zoonotic infections should be directly attributable to resistance in the zoonotic reservoir the impact of agricultural antibiotic use remains controversial 18 27 29 Zoonotic species could acquire resistance genes from human commensal bacteria during the infection process but this hypothesis is difficult to test For pathogens with high horizontal transmission rates resistant bacteria will spread rapidly once they have emerged and prevalence will be maintained at a steady state by horizontal transmission Thus the impact of subsequent heterospecific transmission is limited Figure 1 Nevertheless one or two heterospecific transmission events could be sufficient to cause the appearance of a highly successful ARB genotype in humans affecting the timing nature and extent of spread within the human population 22 Not only are such events difficult to trace but their impact is impossible to measure since there is no way to know what type of resistance would have appeared and with what temporal pattern if transfers from animals had been prevented The case where horizontal human transmission rates are intermediate is particularly interesting If each case in a population generates approximately one new case a situation we call quasi epidemic transmission each instance of heterospecific transmission will initiate a long chain of horizontal transmission that eventually burns out Quasi epidemic transmission can amplify a relatively low amount of heterospecific transmission and substantially increase prevalence 23 25 The effect is sustained as long as heterospecific transmission continues A corollary is that banning agricultural antibiotic use would have maximal benefits if horizontal transmission is quasi epidemic 24 Moreover the effects are most difficult to estimate because both heterospecific and horizontal transmission must be accounted for These principles apply to bacteria associated with outpatient antibiotic use and community acquired infections as well as those that are primarily hospital acquired Although quasi epidemic transmission would seem to be a special case it may in fact be the rule for many hospital acquired bacteria because it is the natural endpoint of the interplay between economics and ecology 30 By spending money on hospital infection control hospital administrators can reduce nosocomial transmission rates for resistant bacteria For example hospitals may screen and isolate patients who are likely to be carriers i e active surveillance and implement infection control measures but this comes at the cost of isolating patients 31 Total costs are minimized by spending just enough to eliminate or nearly eliminate the pathogen thus quasi epidemic transmission is the economic optimum 30 The Community as a Reservoir for Resistance Horizontal transmission is further complicated by population structure such as the movement of humans through hospitals and long term care facilities Medical antibiotic use and horizontal transmission rates are high in hospitals but this is counterbalanced by short hospital stays An emerging view for hospital acquired bacterial infections is that persistent asymptomatic carriage plays a key role in the epidemic of resistance ARB can asymptomatically colonize a person for years even if the number of other people infected during a single hospital visit is less than one this number will exceed one when summed over several hospital visits 25 32 33 Thus the ecological reservoir of resistance in the community plays an important role in the increasing frequency of resistance in hospital acquired infections Short hospital visits and long persistence times of ARB in people guarantee that some of the costs associated with failed infection control are passed on to other hospitals new carriers are frequently discharged from one hospital only to be admitted to another hospital later 30 Thus the harm done by these ARB is borne by the whole human population particularly all of the health care institutions that serve a single catchment population In economic terms the damage caused by the carriage of ARB is a kind of pollution By comparing the total number of new carriers generated in the community the impacts of agricultural antibiotic use on hospitals can be compared directly to the impact hospitals have on each other Figure 2 The rate of heterospecific transmission is intrinsically difficult to measure directly because the risk of exposure and colonization per meal is very small Nevertheless agricultural antibiotic use may generate as many carriers as hospitals for the simple reason that the population experiences many more meals than hospital discharges 34 When agricultural and nosocomial transmission are equally rare in the population the latter will be much easier to identify and quantify A Natural Experiment Glycopeptides and Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci Is the impact of agricultural antibiotic use on the emergence and spread of ARB in humans large or small relative to medical antibiotic use Put another way are farms or hospitals bigger polluters A large scale natural experiment was conducted in the United States and several European countries when each adopted different policies on glycopeptide use in animals avoparcin and humans vancomycin 16 17 35 37 Many European countries approved avoparcin for animal growth promotion in the 1970s but the US did not In the early 1980s demand for vancomycin in US hospitals surged because of increasing aminoglycoside resistance among enterococci and methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus Physicians in US hospitals also used oral vancomycin for some Clostridium difficile infections 37 39 In the late 1980s and early 1990s vancomycin resistant enterococci VRE emerged and spread through US health care systems In Europe hospitals used less vancomycin because most enterococci were sensitive to aminoglycosides and oral vancomycin was seldom used VRE still emerged and spread through European hospitals but the problem has been less severe than in the US 40 A different pattern emerges for community prevalence of VRE VRE are rarely found outside of hospitals in the US except for patients who have a prior history of hospitalization Community prevalence of VRE in the US is typically less than 1 In contrast community prevalence of VRE was estimated at 2 12 in Europe during the late 1990s including carriage by people with no history of hospitalization 17 41 48 In other words the European community reservoir generated by vancomycin use in hospitals and avoparcin use in agriculture was apparently much larger than the US community reservoir generated only by vancomycin use in hospitals The prevalence of VRE in the community declined after the EU banned avoparcin 15 Thus avoparcin is at least partly responsible for the reservoir of VRE in the European community but how much of that reservoir came from avoparcin and how much came from hospitals To weigh the impact we subtract the community prevalence of VRE in the US 1 from the community prevalence of VRE in Europe 2 The remainder 1 is attributed to avoparcin This analysis probably underestimates the real impact because vancomycin was used less in European than in US hospitals Thus avoparcin use in Europe would appear to be responsible for generating a larger reservoir of VRE in the community than US hospitals Put another way the impact of avoparcin use on European hospitals was larger than the impact of US hospitals on one another Conclusion Despite the evidence that avoparcin use has had a large impact on the emergence and spread of VRE by increasing the reservoir of VRE in the EU some uncertainty continues to surround the clinical significance of VRE strains of animal origin and of the zoonotic origins of resistance in general Bacterial strains circulating in hospitalized populations may be genetically distinct from those circulating in the general human population 13 17 49 Thus bacterial populations are some combination of zoonotic quasi epidemic and epidemic strains The complexity of bacterial population biology and genetics makes it practically impossible to trace bacteria or resistance factors from the farm to the hospital or to directly attribute some fraction of new infections to agricultural antibiotic use Asymptomatic carriage of resistance factors by nonfocal commensal bacteria adds to a general risk of resistance but transfer of resistance among bacterial species is unpredictable and difficult to quantify Until more evidence is available it is prudent and reasonable to consider bacteria with resistance genes a general threat 50 52 Some part of the controversy over agricultural antibiotic use has been a disagreement about how to weigh evidence and make decisions when the underlying biological processes are complex In this case the effects of agricultural antibiotic use on human health remain uncertain despite extensive investigation and the effects may be unknowable unprovable or immeasurable by the empirical standards of experimental biology What should be done when complexity makes an important public health effect intrinsically difficult to measure What is an appropriate null hypothesis or its equivalent Should the same standards of proof be used in science and science based policy Where should the burden of proof fall Scientific assessments for policy should summarize the best state of the science recognizing that the burdens and standards of proof are necessarily softer because of the uncertainty that is introduced by biological complexity The best decisions weigh the evidence in light of the inherent uncertainty The EU banned the use of antibiotics for growth promotion based on the precautionary principle The use of the precautionary principle was criticized by some as unscientific in this context In fact the intrinsic problem of knowability posed by the biological complexity of the problem makes the use of precautionary decision making particularly suitable in this arena The assumption that plausible dangers are negligible even when it is known that such dangers are constitutively very difficult to measure may be more unscientific than the use of precaution
