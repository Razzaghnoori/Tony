 Background Although numerous hypotheses have been proposed to describe the etiology of aneuploidy in human gametes the only steadfast association remains maternal age 1 2 Besides this association very little information is available about the numerous potential mechanisms that may disrupt normal chromosome segregation in oocytes Based on studies involving compounds that alter microtubular kinetics and induce both cell cycle delay and aneuploidy several groups have proposed that temporal perturbations during mammalian oocyte maturation OM predispose oocytes to aneuploidy 3 4 5 6 In addition to faulty microtubule kinetics perturbations during OM may also stem from abnormal function of centrosomes kinetochores spindle checkpoints proteins the anaphase promoting complex APC the securin separin cohesion complex proteins and the proteasome 7 OM encompasses the nuclear and cytoplasmic changes that occur during the transition from the dictyotene stage of meiosis I to metaphase II MII During this transition tightly regulated post translational phosphorylation dephosphorylation events and proteasome mediated proteolytic reactions regulate the activation and inactivation of signal transduction pathways that control chromatin condensation nuclear membrane dissolution microtubule nucleation and formation of a haploid oocyte 8 9 10 Several kinases that exert major roles during OM include maturation promoting factor MPF 9 11 mitogen activated protein kinases MAPKs 12 13 and the product of the c mos protooncogene Mos kinase 14 15 Also during OM oocytes undergo two highly regulated metaphase anaphase transitions MAT in which homologous chromosomes are equally and randomly segregated to an oocyte and first polar body and a subsequent division in which equational division of sister chromatids results in a haploid oocyte and a second polar body The MATs are predicated upon the coordinated activities of the spindle checkpoint 16 17 the anaphase promoting complex APC or cyclosome 18 19 the proteasome 20 21 and the cohesion complex proteins involved with chromosome cohesion and separation 22 23 24 Alterations in the temporal sequence of these coordinated activities may potentially predispose cells to faulty chromosome segregation Abnormal chromosome segregation has been observed in mice lacking the Mad2 checkpoint protein 25 The spindle checkpoint utilizes sensory proteins that detect kinetochore microtubule tension and occupancy and transiently block anaphase until all of the chromosomes are properly attached to microtubules 16 26 27 Although the mammalian spindle checkpoint appears to differ between mitosis and meiosis the two meiotic divisions and male and female germ cells 28 anaphase subsequently follows stable kinetochore microtubule attachments 17 29 in both vertebrate mitotic 30 and meiotic 31 cells The APC is a large protein complex that ubiquinates mitotic cyclins and other regulatory proteins that are destined for timely proteolysis by proteasomes 10 20 Proteasomes are multicatalytic 26S proteases consisting of a 20S central core catalytic subunit bordered by two 19S components 32 33 which hydrolyze C terminal peptide bonds to acidic basic and hydrophobic amino acid residues 20 34 Proteasomes proteolyze securins which inhibit separase activity Separase is needed for inactivating cohesions and enabling sister chromatid separation 35 36 37 in both fission yeast 38 and mammalian cells 39 Although differences have been reported among species 40 and cell types 41 it appears that the majority of cohesion is removed from mammalian chromosomes during prophase and prometaphase whereas a lesser amount remains at kinetochores until anaphase onset Proteasomes translocated to meiotic spindles of rat oocytes and MG 132 induced inhibition of proteasomal activity resulted in partial segregation of chromosomes during meiosis I 42 Moreover defective proteasomal activity in fission yeast impaired chromosome segregation 38 To test the hypothesis that transient inhibition of proteasomal activity during mouse meiosis I was associated with chromosome missegregation mouse oocytes were exposed in vitro to the reversible proteasome inhibitor MG 132 and metaphase II MII oocytes were analyzed for structural and numerical chromosome aberrations This transient arrest of proteasomal activity represents a perturbation during the normal temporal sequence of events during OM Results Transient exposure of mouse oocytes to MG 132 for 6 h followed by washout of the compound and an additional 17 h culture in vitro enabled exposure of cells during meiosis I and sufficient time for them to progress to metaphase II Although the majority of MII oocytes were classified as normal Fig 1A the data indicated that MG 132 induced a dose response perturbation or delay in the rate of OM and an increase of single unpaired chromatids and hyperploidy in MII oocytes Table I The significant P 0 01 increase in the proportion of MI oocytes Fig 1B in the 10 0 mcg ml group relative to the other groups and the significant P 0 01 decrease of oocytes exhibiting premature centromere separation PCS Fig 1C in the 10 0 mcg ml group relative to the controls suggest that proteasomal inhibition retarded the rate of OM An inverse relationship has been shown to exist between the proportions of arrested MI oocytes and MII oocytes exhibiting PCS 43 The significant P 0 01 dose responses of higher frequencies of MII oocytes with single chromatids Figs 1C 1E and of hyperploidy Figs 1D 1E suggest that the MG 132 induced transient inhibition of proteasomal and calpain activities during meiosis I predisposed oocytes to abnormal chromosome segregation When oocytes were continuously exposed to 0 0 0 5 5 0 25 0 or 50 0 g ml MG 132 from one h after initiating the culture until 17 h later the proportions of MI arrested oocytes were 5 7 5 87 12 3 14 114 39 3 44 112 100 98 98 and 100 91 91 respectively Of the MI oocytes in the 25 0 and 50 0 g ml MG 132 groups 68 2 30 44 and 100 exhibited diffuse chromatin Fig 1F whereas those oocytes continuously exposed to 0 0 0 5 or 5 0 g mlMG 132 did not display diffuse chromatin Additionally the proportions of MI oocytes displaying homologue separation Figs 1G 1H in oocytes transiently exposed to MG 132 for 6 h were 0 0 13 0 0 19 11 5 3 26 15 1 8 53 respectively for 0 0 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 g mlMG 132 Oocytes with premature anaphase polyploidy or structural chromosome aberrations were not found Discussion Proteasome activity is required for germinal vesicle breakdown GVBD in starfish and toad oocytes 44 45 and for activating Xenopus oocytes 45 46 Also proteasomes are needed for regulating centrosome segregation 38 47 kinetochore structure 39 and sister chromatid cohesion and separation 48 When rat oocytes were exposed to the proteasome inhibitor MG132 proteasomes translocated to the meiotic spindle MPF activity was sustained and oocytes were arrested in MI with partially segregated chromosomes 42 Besides inhibiting proteasome activity the peptide aldehyde proteasome inhibitors have been also reported to repress certain lysosomal cysteine proteases and calpains 49 The finding that MG 132 can obstruct the casein degrading activity of the calcium dependent protease calpain 50 appears relevant to oocyte maturation Calpain activity is needed for proteolysis of the c mos proto oncogene product pp39 mos in Xenopus oocytes 51 certain cytoskeletal proteins alpha tubulin actin dynamin lamin B in starfish oocytes 52 and of cyclin in Xenopus egg extracts 53 We report that exposure of mouse oocytes to 10 0 mcg ml MG 132 during meiosis I led to significant P 0 01 increases in the proportions of MI arrested oocytes and of MII oocytes with SC and hyperploidy Coupled with these findings was a significant P 0 01 decrease in the incidence of MII oocytes exhibiting PCS Table 1 Chemical induction of MI arrest in mammalian oocytes and spermatocytes indicates cell cycle retardation which is often associated with aneuploidy 43 54 Although 10 0 mcg ml MG 132 increased the frequency of MI arrested oocytes this cell cycle retardation may not be entirely attributed to proteasome inhibition MG 132 can also inhibit calpains 50 which are needed for cell cycle progression 52 and cyclin degradation 53 Previous studies 5 55 have shown that an inverse relationship usually exists between the proportions of arrested MI oocytes and MII oocytes exhibiting PCS Oocytes residing in MII for longer periods of time tend to display higher frequencies of PCS whereas those deferred in MI spend less time in MII prior to fixation The significant P 0 01 increase in the proportions of MII oocytes exhibiting PCS in controls relative to the 10 0 g ml group reflects the greater length of time that control oocytes spent in MII prior to fixation We suggest that the PCS detected in MII oocytes mainly resulted from in vitro aging As such the frequencies of PCS noted in Table 1would represent independent events relative to the other cytogenetic abnormalities reported On the other hand PCS during meiosis I can result in aneuploid MII oocytes PCS of homologous chromosomes and sister chromatids prior to establishing proper kinetochore spindle attachment during meiosis I increases the probabilities of both homologues going to the same pole and of equational division of sister chromatids during anaphase I Upon normal fertilization MII oocytes with an additional chromosome result in trisomic zygotes whereas oocytes containing an extra chromatid would be expected to produce 50 trisomic zygotes due to random segregation during anaphase II This situation also applies to oocytes missing chromosomes and chromatids Experimental data support PCS as a prelude to aneuploidy PCS of homologues during meiosis I and equational division of sister chromatids during anaphase I 56 57 and premature separation of chromatids during meiosis II 58 59 and mitosis 60 61 have been shown to increase the incidence of aneuploidy in subsequent divisions The partially segregated chromosomes found in rat oocytes exposed to MG 132 may have represented homologous chromosomes and or sister chromatids 42 The origin of single unpaired chromatids in MII oocytes has been proposed to result from premature separation of sister chromatids prior to anaphase I 56 57 The possibility exists that both SC and aneuploidy may have originated from PCS of homologues and sister chromatids during the MAT of meiosis I Upon removal of MG 132 from the culture media during meiosis I and the subsequent resumption of OM and proteasomal activity faulty kinetochore microtubule attachment accompanied by degradation of cohesion proteins could conceivably lead to PCS of homologues and sister chromatids Following anaphase I a probability exists that both homologues and sister chromatids could randomly assort to the same pole and result in SC and aneuploid MII oocytes Although the frequency of homologue separation increased with MG 132 dose the sample size of 11 oocytes is much too low to comment about their possible origin or their influence on other abnormalities detected in MII oocytes The possibility exists that the observed homologue separation may actually reflect anaphase onset The finding of diffuse chromatin in MI oocytes continuously exposed to 25 0 and 50 0 g mlMG 132 may be related to the sustained elevation of MPF activity noted in rat oocytes exposed to MG 132 42 and the stabilization of polyubiquitinated proteins and enhanced deubiquitination of nucleosomal histones in chromatin following proteasomal inhibition 62 Conclusions The findings of the present study indicate that transient in vitro exposure of mouse oocytes to MG 132 is associated with abnormal chromosome segregation However additional data are clearly needed to further investigate the roles of calpain proteolysis and proteasome mediated proteolysis on chromosome segregation as well as the numerous other potential molecular mechanisms of aneuploidy Methods Animals Female ICR Harlan Sprague Dawley Indianapolis IN mice between 26 33 g 8 12 wks of age were used in all experiments They were housed under ambient temperature of 21 23 C relative humidity of 50 5 and a 12 h light 12 h dark photoperiod Feed and water were provided ad libitum This research was approved by the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Animal Resources Advisory Committee Oocyte collection culture and exposure to MG 132 For each replicate experiment five similarly treated mice received an intraperitoneal injection of 7 5 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin Dr A F Parlow National Hormone Peptide Program Torrance CA to augment the number of maturing follicles Forty six h later the mice were euthanized by CO 2 inhalation and their reproductive tracts placed into Waymouth culture medium Gibco Grand Island New York No 11220 035 The ovaries were isolated and cumulus oocyte complexes COC were liberated from antral follicles The COC were then transferred to a 35 15 mm culture dish Falcon No 1008 Becton Dickinson Co Lincoln Park

g ml MG 132 Z leu leu CHO Calbiochem La Jolla CA No 474790 was prepared in Waymouth medium containing 7 5 L per ml dimethylsulfoxide DMSO as the solvent MG 132 is a peptide aldehyde that inhibits ubiquitin mediated proteolysis by binding to and inactivating 20S and 26S proteasomes 49 62 Although 1 10 M MG 132 inhibited first polar body extrusion in rat oocytes its activity is reversible 42 We conducted preliminary experiments to obtain a MG 132 dose range that would transiently perturb or inhibit OM during meiosis I while enabling oocytes to complete OM following washing out of the compound Data from oocytes cultured in either 0 0 0 5 5 0 25 0 or 50 0 g ml MG 132 from one h after initiating the culture until 17 h later showed that the two higher doses completely blocked oocytes in MI On the other hand when oocytes were exposed to these same MG 132 doses from one h after initiating the culture until 6 h later when the chemical was washed out 4X and cultured for an additional 17 h in media without MG 132 oocytes exposed to 25 0 and 50 0 g ml MG 132 were still arrested in MI Thus data from these preliminary experiments enabled the selection of a protocol in which oocytes were placed into complete culture media and incubated for 1 h prior to adding either 0 solvent only 5 0 7 5 or 10 0 g ml MG 132 Six h later the MG 132 was washed out of the media by rinsing the oocytes four times in complete media without MG 132 and then re incubated for 17 h Under this protocol oocytes were exposed to MG 132 during meiosis I and the subsequent 17 h culture time provided sufficient time for the oocytes to overcome the MG 132 induced meiotic block and progress to MII Control oocytes were cultured in 7 5 l DMSO per ml complete media and processed in the same manner as those exposed to MG 132 Cytogenetic analysis and statistical analysis of data Oocytes were collected and processed according to a mass harvest procedure 63 and chromosomes were C banded 64 to distinguish between complete dyads MII chromosomes and disjoined dyads single chromatids In each cell analyzed the number of chromosomes and or chromatids was counted at 1000 magnification to provide data for calculating aneuploidy The number of hypoploid n 10 19 1 2 haploid n 20 hyperploid n 20 1 2 29 1 2 and polyploid n 30 40 MII oocytes were recorded An oocyte classified as 20 1 2 contains 20 dyads and one chromatid or one half dyad The frequencies of each ploidy class were divided by the total number of MII oocytes analyzed excluding polyploidy The frequencies of MII oocytes displaying premature centromere separation PCS single chromatids SC premature anaphase PA were also calculated relative to the total number of MII oocytes analyzed Since MI and polyploid oocytes are distinct categories and are disregarded when computing aneuploidy their frequencies were calculated relative to the total number of oocytes analyzed The criteria for eliminating a cell from analysis included inadequate C banding for discriminating between intact dyads and those separated at the centromere overlapped or clumped chromosomes or excessive chromosome scatter that precluded an objective analysis of numerical or structural aberrations The frequencies of hyperploid cells were used as a measure of aneuploidy because an unknown proportion of the hypoploid cells is influenced by technical artifact resulting from excessive chromosome scatter during slide preparation Chi Square analysis and the Fisher s Exact Test were used for data analyses Author s contributions Each author contributed
