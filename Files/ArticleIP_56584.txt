 Volunteer Dammit Subject Weisberg s Virtue Wieseltier s Venom Re From michael berube Date Sun Nov 21 Kudos to Jacob Weisberg for reading Cornel West on his own instead of relying on Leon Wieseltier s version Wieseltier s 1995 essay on the decline of the black intellectual wasn t really the devastating critique of West s work that Weisberg once took it to be and it s relatively good to hear that although Weisberg had hitherto set his lights by it he no longer agrees with Wieseltier s conclusion that West s work is almost entirely worthless The truth is that Wieseltier s piece was a shameful spite ridden hatchet job on West motivated almost entirely by the fact that West had been profiled in The New Yorker in 1994 and then assessed along with lesser lights bell hooks and Michael Dyson by me in a January 1995 essay that likened contemporary black intellectuals to the New York intellectuals of the postwar period Robert Boynton in the Feb 1995 Atlantic Monthly had pressed the same analogy by reference to Skip Gates Shelby Steele and Stanley Crouch and the analogy sent all too many black and Jewish intellectuals into frenzies of identity politics and territorialism Wieseltier s reaction was the worst somewhat akin to his frantic ill informed denunciation of the essay by Lionel Trilling s son in a recent issue of the American Scholar It s true that West can be formulaic derivative clunky and annoyingly self absorbed though surely in this last category Wieseltier is more than a match for him And he really is a mass of contradictions But his virtues are considerable nonetheless and as Weisberg writes suit him well for the role of Bradley s counselor This is much more than can be said for Wieseltier hence the venom of his essay A tip of the hat then to Mr Weisberg whose work I ve enjoyed often in the past five years ever since his devastating critique of The Bell Curve in a fall 1994 issue of New York magazine To reply click here Michael Berube is the author of Life as We Know It A Father a Family and an Exceptional Child Subject Weisberg s Chekhov Re From David Edelstein Date Mon Nov 15 A very lucid analysis But Jacob you make fun of the Chekhov references without explaining them West has really grappled with the great plays and found in the lack of a central consciousness the protagonists are not mouthpieces for the playwright and refusal to demonize even the most destructive seeming characters a hallmark of Christian forgiveness I confess I don t know as much as I should about Christian theology and I m not sure Chekhov knew all that much either but I do share West s and many others view of Chekhov as a kind of saint of the drama albeit a saint with a rarely acute bullshit detector It s not risible I wish all political theorists and politicians would read Chekhov To reply click here Subject Shapiro on the Stump Re From David Margolick Date Thurs Nov 18 In touting Walter Shapiro s candidacy for the Senate you neglected to mention

WP carries inside Bill Bradley s speech Monday in which he charged that Al Gore had little interest in campaign finance reform because the current money raising system favors incumbents Today s Papers Nov 23 Bradley portrays himself as the guru of an insurgent movement fighting for campaign finance reform But he s more closely linked to big money than to grassroots Bradley s unexpected challenge to Gore is backed by numerous corporate titans especially those from Wall Street writes John Broder in his Oct 24 New York Times piece Bradley Relies on Wall Street to Raise Funds In contrast Al Gore s contributions come more often from humble folks like my own family As the current U S News World Report notes Vice President Al Gore is trouncing challenger Bill Bradley in the battle to collect federal matching money In fact he s on a record breaking pace The agency matches donations up to 250 from individuals leading Gore allies to crow that they ve received more small donations than Bradley The biggest contributors in the room at a recent Al Gore fundraiser here in California s Antelope Valley were my husband and I Our check was for 20 To reply click here Subject My Own Vote com
