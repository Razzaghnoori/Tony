                i know they have a waiting list and a quota on immigration now   ive lost track i dont really know i i do have some opinions but go ahead   yeah um well i know that theyre theyre real cautious about letting Middle Eastern people into the country now because of all the terrorism what do   uh   what what   okay i hadnt thought about that uh   what all do you know about it   uh well i just have an opinion now i didnt think i i thought the terrorism thing was overstated i mean there was nothing over here in fact even this is not our subject i guess but uh or maybe it is or isnt i suppose   yeah   my wife when she talked about the Middle East and everyones afraid you know of how the war was going to go and everything i said i said i told her i said no its just not going to happen theres not going to be any terrorism over here and there wasnt you know they they just didnt have an organization but uh i i concerned im concerned that were letting too many that we dont have enough controls i think that uh the Asian gangsters that weve let in here and if and the guys from uh Cuba you know there theres a lot of criminals down in Florida that weve let in from Cuba that Fidel pushed off on us and uh   umhum   and and the last you know out of all the Asians we brought in there theres a tremendous criminal element that we let in from from Asia and i think that theres got to be some sort of controls over that i mean this Asia mafia thing is getting out of hand   thats right umhum   i i dont i dont i didnt know what i dont even know what our controls are i dont even know what uh uh we if we have any guidelines at all uh on on immigration um i always thought that we did but i dont i dont i dont i dont know what they are right now   there i dont think theres much of much of one because im sure all the people from Cuba have been released from that camp that they were in   yeah   and uh most of them its just like Australia most of them were criminals from Cuba and i think that was just an attempt that that Fidel Castro to undermine you know   yeah   the United States to some extent so he just released and got rid of all his criminals and sent them to us   yeah the yeah   and its almost the same thing in in uh from Asia because a lot of a lot of them was put out of business in Vietnam after the war and   because we i i do have some sympathy with uh you know of course we have this big Mexican problem not a problem but i think that we need to do something with uh the immigration of back and across forth across Mexico uh   umhum   i uh im sympathetic i dont know what the answer is i guess im sympathetic certainly with that that that they they want to come over here and they i guess hundreds of thousands come over every year to work and if if they have if they have jobs you know i i hear the story about theyre taking away American jobs but i dont know uh i dont know how many American jobs they are really taking away im so i im sympathetic but i dont have an answer i dont uh   right umhum   i think that we should have good relations with with Mexico but thats not really exactly immigration it is and it isnt uh i i dont know to what degree we owe the people who come across before theyre citizens owe owe the children education and all that uh although the idea their education is an answer to a lot of problems in the world so   umhum   i guess its what they their the Mexican kids get a good education along the way maybe thats a benefit to everybody you know   yeah and uh a lot of the Mexican people just cross the border during the daytime to come over here and work   umhum   and they have green cards and uh then like you said a lot of i run into people every day that cant speak English   oh yeah   and uh and and most of them you know are working in janitorial positions so   yeah and that   so i i dont know you like you said i dont know how much how much theyre taking from the work force you know   yeah i never thought that they were much i do cringe when i hear some of the problems weve had   umhum   uh um uh of course you mentioned the language i i feel so bad that we here in Texas or certainly the southern part of the United States uh California Texas and all that just why our kids dont speak fluid Spanish uh by junior high you know um as well as us you know   hm umhum   so that we could wouldnt have a language barrier certainly now that is a shame that we uh have this tremendous border of Mexico and then in Europe you know they they speak their French and all and they try they go out of their way to try to speak their their neighbors language so they can understand we we certainly we dont really even make an effort   umhum   to speak Spanish and i feel bad about that uh go ahead   well thats i yeah i took Spanish in school and thats you know one reason that i did it is because   yeah   because whenever you travel anywhere near the border you know there more and more people speak Spanish   yeah i guess its never too late i i do have some Spanish books and ive always uh every year i say im going to try to speak uh some newcomers language you know i dont know if its costing us any money or how much money theyre putting into it uh thats always a factor i mean how much my wife says they how much the federal government is putting into   well yeah well its basically on the well i think its mostly concentrated toward the borders and uh its more um the immigration is tied in with uh drug trafficking so   immigration   they have to watch out who comes in and and theyre always finding drugs on you know on the most um innocent looking kind of   yeah   i forgot what they found but a dog found it the other day you know on on the border   oh yeah oh yeah i i think that certainly is a problem uh i guess our immigration history thats a great subject uh they didnt say to talk about that but that is i mean uh on Ellis Island they you know theyre redoing that and going to make it a museum a national museum   umhum   now that certainly was interesting since all of us had uh ancestors that came over that way or not all but i guess uh i guess if you go back far enough you came over on a uh a boat originally you know but uh a lot of us have parents grandparents my grandparents came over in about eighteen ninety or something like that and im sure they came over you know through Ellis Island you know   thats right yeah   so uh we all immigrants in one way or or another well we certainly are coming from Europe you know or not   yeah yeah and one of the one of the things that really gets to me uh about the Mexicans is that um once they have children over here their children are American citizens then   oh yeah that those were laws are unusual you know   yeah and then theyll ship the parents back and that leaves the children without any parents so   yeah that i dont understand i mean uh whose rule is that you know   and they you know and they and and they just follow the rule no matter you you know so that doesnt seem fair to the children   yeah sometimes common sense should take over rather than yeah thats a law doesnt sound like it makes any sense at all   right   that you would do it that way   umhum   you would think they could at least get a a a visa or something until they uh got citizenship im sure they want to   yeah and then they granted them amnesty if they could prove when was that and it was in the eighties sometime if they if they could prove theyd been here five years   oh yeah i heard something about that yeah   and uh a lot of them had been you know some of them some of them moved back and forth but uh   yeah yeah   most of them dont ever want to go back to Mexico especially the way it was then   oh no oh no i i could see uh you can see why   umhum   i dont know how much immigration we have from Europe and everything what the controls are   i think most you know like especially the celebrities and everything they just have a uh well they have to get a green card if theyre going to do any kind of work you know in the movies and   yeah   and such but most of them have temporary visas   yeah i guess you can get work visas pretty easily uh   as long its like well its its a kind of a a bad a bad example but when Rafael Septien took the job with the Cowboys they had to offer his job to any other applicant that could do it   yeah oh really   yeah so that you know and thats the thing with the jobs   yeah   and of course no one beat him out so you know   yeah   he just ruined his own career so   oh well yeah   yeah   yeah well its its still interesting after all this time that were probably one of the one of the few countries that people are still you know desperately trying to immigrate to uh although i guess Europe now that the Communism is falling apart that maybe therell be wont be that much of a rush to get out of all the Communist Communist countries uh i guess Poland now is now a non Communist so   umhum   maybe not maybe immigration from Europe to here will slowly you know slowly uh change maybe itll be even out like trade you know so many people will immigrate here in in the twentieth at at the year two thousand so many of the people who will go back overseas you know maybe itll average out i dont know   yeah i think so   it doesnt has doesnt seem so far but   because there are other uh job uh uh job opportunities in Europe that there arent here and   umhum   you know even um like orchestra orchestra players can find a job sometimes in Europe when they cant find one here and um im a trumpet player   umhum are you a teacher   uh no i uh i dont anymore i just went to school and i was a music major for a while   oh really yeah   but i had a trumpet teacher that played in the Mexico City Symphony so so he had to have a work visa there   yeah oh   and of course they had a lot of musicians from from other countries and uh in the Mexico City Symphony   umhum umhum   but i think um like three out of the four other people in the trumpet section are from Mexico now   oh really   but i think the conductor i dont know or one of the conductors is is from another country   umhum   its like any other symphony   yeah   you know and then and Eduardo Manas from Mexico so so he had to you know
