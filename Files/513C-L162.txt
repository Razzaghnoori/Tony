 SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY July 12 1990 Dear Dental Hygiene Colleague In the fall of 1987 I was fortunate to be named one of the recipients of an A Rebekah Fisk Memorial Scholarship If you are one of the many individuals who have supported this scholarship in the past I want to thank you for your help As a 1989 graduate of the Indiana University School of Dentistry Dental Hygiene Program I believe I have received the best professional education available During the year I have been in private practice I have found myself drawing on all aspects of my education The scholarship named in honor of the school s first director of dental hygiene was established in 1982 Since that time the financial burden of a college education has been lessened for many deserving students However current and future dental hygiene students need our ongoing assistance Each of us can help replenish the Fisk Scholarship fund by making a tax deductible contribution of 25 or more check made payable to Indiana University Foundation Thank you for considering this request Your generous contribution would greatly benefit many of our future colleagues as they pursue the same high quality professional training that we received at IU Sincerely Dental Hygiene Alumna
