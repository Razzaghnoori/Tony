 October 22 1993 Dear Colleague This year 1993 marks the ten year anniversary of the A Rebekah Fisk Memorial Scholarship During this time 34 students have been selected by the dental hygiene faculty to receive scholarship awards I would like to personally thank the alumni and friends of the dental hygiene program who have made past contributions and hope you will continue with your support In addition I would encourage other alumni and friends to consider providing their support for this scholarship fund Dental hygiene students at Indiana University are incurring more and more debt as they progress through school The School of Dentistry has limited ability to provide scholarship money to deserving students who otherwise might choose another career option because of educational expense The A Rebekah Fisk Memorial Scholarship enables the dental hygiene program to provide financial assistance to students so that they can concentrate on their education while in school Last year we were able to award six 500 scholarships to students in our dental hygiene program These scholarships were made possible through contributions from alumni and friends of the program The A Rebekah Fisk Memorial Scholarship fund is a priority for the dental hygiene program I hope that you will help us to help students by making a tax deductible gift this year All contributions are very important and with your support we can really make a difference Sincerely Director P S Please make your check payable to IU Foundation and use the enclosed postage paid envelope to make your contribution Thank you
