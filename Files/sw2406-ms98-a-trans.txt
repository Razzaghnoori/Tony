 okay movies i ve i haven t seen too many lately i have kids and we went and saw The Rescuers Down Under over the the break do do you have kids you take to movies or uh huh no no kids yeah it s a Walt Walt Disney movie and it didn t get as you know as good a reviews as like the Little Mermaid the last one and got all kinds of Academy Awards and things last year but this one was i thought was excellent the i can t both was that the animated version yeah it s animated and i can t believe how good they re getting with their animation now it s just just the special effects you know and in this movie this there s this boy and he rescues this uh bald eagle and uh and it s a huge eagle you know wing span of twenty feet or something like that and the boy actually rides on his back and he rides through the clouds you know and you see him coming out of the clouds his head coming out and then the bird coming out and it you know they re flying all over with it and i mean i know there they there must have used been computers or something for animation this day but it was just so real realistic and lifelike and good animation what a good show even better than Roger Rabbit insofar as animation well Roger was a composite one there s one there s a movie i ve seen Roger Rabbit that s not a recent movie yeah but uh i enjoyed that show yeah that was made in a few i don t know several years back i guess yeah yeah latest latest one i ve saw which was a mistake to go see was Lionheart had Claude Van Damme uh huh he was he s of course uh i guess he s trained in this uh martial arts of some sort but the plot was bland the acting was bland It was just mostly centered upon his abilities to chop them up huh yeah chop them up exactly and this is supposed to be the the guy that s uh replaces Bruce Lee or whatever or or the next Chuck Norris yeah type guy or he s singular i guess you know you know how they can make any of any single one of them in a movie to be a super uh huh superstar superstar of any sort you know but Chuck Norris of course could be just about equal if not more uh huh um hum and all of them i guess could be in that fashion or category hum uh huh uh huh it was about uh a French Foreign Legion fellow keeps trying who deserts to go help his brother s wife who got who became a widow because he was selling drugs and he got killed really uplifting huh so he deserts and goes to New York and he starts out by fighting to make money and then he moves on to L A to where that where she is to just help him out um hum it was really i mean the Hollywood really must think there s some real dummies out there or something i don t know yeah i haven t heard i hadn t heard much about that movie i other than it was a chop them up movie but uh well i guess that s one i won t go see well it was worth the buck i guess oh you went to the dollar movie yeah yeah they show up at the dollar movie right after they get come out you know they re usually not not that great or didn t do that great anyway let me see let me see another movie i watched uh i want to see is uh that new one uh a lot of that won all those Academy Awards this year Dances With Wolves i haven t seen that have you seen that one yet uh huh yeah what what what i i absorbed all of that movie in one sitting uh i guess what made it so good was the cinematography cinematography the the wide open you know spaces yeah and the music and uh well it had an excellent story line Everything about it was good um hum um i thought an excellent one too was misery with Kathy Bates and James Caan i m not a James Caan fan but that was a well directed and acted movie is that right i d recommend it It s a little on the violent side uh huh but then what movie isn t anymore right right yeah our movies today it used to be X and you know and PGs used to be Rs and seems like the rating system you know is kind of switching that way a little bit well i have no objections to it It s just uh and it s a matter of your taste uh yeah yeah oh yeah it s just that yeah it s just that the rating system seems you know instead of having X now they have what NC seventeen yeah they just changed it because X had a connotation with it you know so and even on those type they don t show what you expect right a lot of those are really violent type movies right really gory um yeah that seems to be the norm of most movies but um what the hey this is America let me see let me see one movie i saw i guess it was a while back Red October have you seen that one yeah yes i have that was pretty good yeah i read the book before so i knew the story line going in but they changed some things in the movie wasn t the same i thought the book was better than the movie but i thought the movie was really good as well i always wait for the movie i don t have time to read the book yeah i don t i read about one or two thick novels like that a year uh huh you know that s about all the time i can i can spare but that was a good show i thought you know i read about how they did uh an article on how they did all the special effects with the submarine you know that wasn t a real submarine you saw in the water it was it was all done in studio with smoke and mirrors and all the Hollywood magic it all those underwater scenes yeah i thought you know it looked to me like it was a real submarine they did me to that was in the water you know that s the magic of Hollywood special effects i hear this movie F X part two coming out is uh pretty good yeah is that right did you ever see the original one i didn t it was uh you ought to rent the uh F X part one It doesn t say part one but it it s F slash X huh what s that about a uh special effects man who somehow gets involved in this um oh i m not sure i can t remember It s been a while since i ve seen it But he he gets involved in some sort of bad dealings with somebody and he has to go underground and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in doing what needs to be done hm and uh to to fool people and and things huh right and using makeup and using the all the tricks all the props and whatever to get to where he needs to go uh huh that sounds like an interesting concept but you need to rent the first one first to understand what s going on the second uh if if that is that the second one follows the first i don t know if they have the uh original actors on that first one to that one uh huh they re supposed to be coming out with all these Desert Storm movies oh i expected those i mean Hollywood i mean they were doing their dealings with that before they even got over there i think this summer too yeah yeah well they had some in some of those you know they i guess they retitled some movies that were going to be about Lebanese and and you know and uh huh and Americans and they decide oh make it Iraqis and Americans you know and they just change the title and uh and reshot a few parts you know where they yeah you know where they could i guess they figured we wouldn t can t tell the difference between an actual names will not be used yeah right eventually i m sure they will come out with the the the proper names yeah right it was such a it i guess they they ll probably come out with a lot of movies you know it was it was such a rout though you know i don t know you know they probably do the story of someone who was shot down early in the war or something and how he survived or latest story or about or about those two newsmen or whatever that got captured uh huh Kevin Costner i understand is supposed to be play Schwartzkopf supposedly is that right i don t know that s just one of the many rumors that floats around yeah or what you read um hum well i think we ve probably pretty much used up the tape i guess yeah yeah it s been about five minutes it s been nice talking with you same and uh we ll keep on watching those movies huh talk to you on the next go around okay bye bye adios
