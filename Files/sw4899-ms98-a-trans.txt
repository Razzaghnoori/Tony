        opinion on whether we need to change to the metric system is that i dont think that i have an opinion one way or the other         i kind of feel that there are more important issues to be dealt with than worrying about the metric system and i think the reason it failed last time is that most people really just didnt see any real benefit in changing so i guess if we were to go about making the change you would have to really demonstrate to people that there is some legitimate reason to make the change that would directly benefit them otherwise were never going to really see any change   yeah well i oh ill say this first im certainly for conversion to the metric system unfortunately im not sure how well grounded my uh feelings for that are maybe its   umhum   just because its a highly regular system and you dont have to worry about whether something is five thousand two hundred and eighty units or or   yeah   im just going to walk over here and stop my cats from doing what theyre doing um and the metric system is you know   hum   you it has so many different prefixes like autometer and femtometer and stuff like that you dont need them just use the you know the meter the kilometer you know whatever its i dont know that thats i think thats its primary uh   yeah   primary uh use is that and of course in scientific uses uh things like the like a mile uh or im not sure a pound uh have have some use whenever you try to uh combine them into formula then you have to uh have conversion constants and things like that so most most of the formulas although they are are some that uh dont obey this rule most scientific formulas can be adapted with the metric system because of the way things are interrelated that youll need those extra conversion constants   yeah   like a cubic lets see what is it a cubic centimeter of water is also a gram of water at standard temperature and pressure   umhum well whenever the Canadians changed were since were very close to the Canadian border here we kind of observed things when they made their change and they were able to convert a little more readily although most people up there still would talk in terms of fahrenheit instead of Celsius   umhum   uh even though they try to get you to use the Celsius system it it went a little easier because Canada is so influenced by Britain   right   and a lot of the products and services that they were either dealing with or receiving on their end were really equipped for the metric system and uh it was a easier change and they saw some direct benefit because they didnt have to pour the extra income in to making special products just for the  older system   right   but um you know in in this country you have really stubborn people   yeah thats true   who i dont think are going to especially you know they may do it in the more in the big city centers or in certain round uh manufacturing industries but the average person in Raleigh Missouri i dont think is going to what was this celsius stuff you know i dont     well it it happens first well it i guess it happens first in either of the two places i guess either in the school or just products   hum   uh one thing about uh a lot of US products im just looking at something here shaving cream that is not in this case uh list both what they are in the English or British Imperial System whatever its called units uh and the metric system units so this just says seven ounces   umhum   uh i i think ive heard that in Canada what they did was primarily they didnt change the size the sizes that various products came in they just changed the way they were annotated   yeah   so something before was you know was and see you have things in odd measurements thats even true like for film and like you know sixteen millimeter and thirty five millimeter film   umhum   those odd things come about im not sure exactly what they are because its like a half inch or whatever they just you know they say okay millimeter this is a European thing too so uh well just used to keep using the standard size but well just call it something else so you have odd things like sixteen millimeter and thirty five millimeter where originated in the metric system itll probably be something regular but i guess thats thats not too   yeah   not too important but i think uh at least in northern or northeastern schools uh they people are relatively uh well inducted into the metric system       anyone who takes you know chemistry physics anything like that in school i think in most cases its done in in metric system it was for me   yeah i i learned metrics you know in high school and and before that so im familiar with the system im still using inches and pounds and the like i the only thing we as Americans have become accustomed to as far as the metric system is now we buy two liter bottles of Coke you know   yeah when you tell somebody liters bottles of Coke yeah       thats true that is and oddity   i mean it sounds you know a gallon sounds like thats too much but two liters and and you know doesnt sound as bad as three quarts or
