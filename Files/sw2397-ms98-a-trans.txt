 okay um i guess um this is probably really a good subject for me because i really like to do uh hand work uh mostly i do needlepoint i guess oh really what kinds of things have you done but um um well i ve made a lot of baby gifts it seem like that s like especially lately there s been so many babies that uh bibs and blankets and things like that wall hangings aha um do you ever keep any of your stuff isn t that funny no i do crochet and a lot of uh things like that and i have very little of my own stuff and it s kind of embarrassing people say let me see some of your work oh well can you go to so and so s house yeah isn t that funny i guess i do have one thing friend of mine gave me a clock kit and i i needlepointed the face yes ooh and i uh kept that because she gave me that so that that would be definitely something you d want to keep was was the whole face done or just the numbers and and like minute oh yeah and it s real neat marks um basically the whole well no i guess the minute marks but the minute marks are done they re like hearts oh and then the at the numbers they they re kind of outlined and stuff it it was quite bit of work but you know it was a lot of fun too i really like doing stuff like that so i did some needlepoint years ago and then i got into the Bargello oh what s that well it s an Italian um needlework using using the uh i started to say the canvas but the uh hum the what kind of cloth uses that i i ve just gone blank but it s used with yarn and it usually takes long stitches over two or three openings in the cloth huh and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors like it could be a flame stitch where so rather than drawing a picture you re making a design like a geometric or whatever and it was used quite often in the colonial times to uh uh to upholster chairs and so forth as well as the crewel um embroidery work that was done on them wow that s interesting what did you what kind of things did you do what i did when i was doing that was mostly pillows you know for sofas and so forth and uh huh i can t find one that i ve done it it s one of those things i didn t i didn t give them away but i didn t know if it s been my color choice or multiple moves oh yeah or or what and it i was so proud of them when i got them finished but i have no idea where they are what did you call that bargello it s B A R G E double L O huh that s i ve never heard of that before i ve probably seen it though i mean when you described it i suspect you i suspect you have yeah i mean when you described it it sounded like something you know that would be around i guess but i ve never heard of it before and it s really interesting um i guess i ve decorated baskets and stuff before in the past but i ve kind of gotten out of that i use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows me too yeah that s interesting really that s yeah it is how did you know to choose this subject tonight that s funny uh how did you what kinds of decorations did you use with the baskets how were you decorating the baskets oh basically bows and lace uh ribbons um i really wanted to do you know so many of them now have the ribbons where i m not sure how they do it but the ribbons um they make them they like i don t know how to explain it they make them hard you know like fabric that s been stiffened in yes yeah i ve never done that and those are so neat i mean i would really like to do those but i ve seen some and there there they i suspect they re fairly simple because the one lady i ve seen i know that does it i ve never asked her any questions but she has three kids all under the age of like six um and and they re all a handful so it s got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly oh definitely yeah when i do um crochet it s usually the lacy Victorian type oh things like that and i stiffen those with a a glue mixture it s like white glue and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped in and then allowed to dry in those those draping bows i mean those draping streamers i don t know i was just there s bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that s very similar that s not going to melt too much with uh oh yeah uh high humidity that s i think that s what my concern was was it really sure and how they would how they would last in in a room do you know what my concern is how will i dust this thing i m terrible you re right no that s true that s funny so many of my crafts well right now i m looking at a little uh quilted uh uh hanging it s like it s a flag and i don t want to wash it because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth but it s such a dust collector to be yeah out and so forth and most of my things are dust collectors uh and i hate to dust so first thing i think of is how easy would this thing be to clean oh i know that s funny no i just um i have really gotten out of it i don t do it quite as much as i used to um i guess because i i went back to school so i don t have as much time oh you don t have time now and i have two children also so that it keeps me very busy but i really enjoy it when i do do it when i get the chance you know it s really you definitely don t have time it s so relaxing to just sit and but once i get started i can t put it down i just that i have a similar problem i ve got to have time or i don t even want to get into it in the first place uh huh uh huh and so i end up lots of time not doing anything at all i know i started a project it s been over a year ago that i swore i was going to finish for somebody for Christmas and i you just didn t say which Christmas right that s what i keep telling this person well i didn t tell you what year what was this project um well it s a it s uh cross stitch and it s a picture and it s a wildlife it has deer and trees and it s really beautiful but it s going to be a lot of work and you know i ve i have worked on it quite a bit but not as much as i d like to you know it s just so hard now this is done in the needlepoint uh huh well i shouldn t it s counted cross stitch actually is what i m doing and so it s really since it s counted you know it s really a lot of work yep yes yes i do know i have done a little bit of that but i ve decided that that s something that demands my time my my total attention uh huh and so i ve got to have total almost total silence i can t really watch television if the pattern is very intricate it sounds like you d have lots of shading on that particular piece it is not does not sound like an easy one to finish uh huh yep no it really isn t and i tell you really i could just kick myself for even starting it because i have a feeling i m never going to get it done i m probably going to hear about it the rest of my life oh i m sure you ll get it done but it just may not of the original obviously not of the original time schedule no that s true i i just don t know when i m ever it just seems like there s just never enough time to pick it up and do it you know it s just really hard but i really do en like i said i really enjoy it when i do it s just hard just hard finding the time that can be dedicated to that uh huh and there s there s so many other things that i i have done you know in the meantime like i said so many baby gifts i ve made a lot of bibs and wall hangings and so you know those don t take much time at all so it s no big deal for me to pick those up and do them do you do you use patterns i mean like a book of patterns or do you go out an buy a a kit like for a bib or something like that no no i usually just buy a pattern book i have several pattern books and i just go with those okay and then i buy the bibs separate usually i think it s a little bit cheaper in the long run and then i just use whatever colors i want to i don t usually use the colors they tell me to and it it depends on what it is you know but some things especially letters um if they suggest certain colors for letters i just go with whatever i want to yeah i yeah that s what i would do too yeah or whatever i have that s there s yeah there s a few designs i guess i ve done myself but not very many real simple ones you know i do i ve made i made a little uh little uh little thumb print and made it a bunny ooh it was really easy i mean just just did a thumb print you know what what with ink oh okay uh huh and then see i didn t cross stitch the actual thumb print you know that was just the ink and then i made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth that was so simple and it just it didn t take anything at all oh that sounds really neat did you do did you use like a stamp pad an ink okay so you just uh huh just like being finger printed and then i just
