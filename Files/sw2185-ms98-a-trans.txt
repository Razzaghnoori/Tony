 well i was just looking around my house and thinking about the painting that i ve done uh huh and the last time that um we tackled it i did the kitchen and i had gone through a period of depression at one time and painted everything a dark it was called a sassafras it was kind of an orangish brown okay it was not real pretty anyway so the kitchen was one of the rooms that got hit with that color yeah uh huh i see i tried to cover it with white and it was quite a a feat getting that dark color covered and then just the hassles getting around the cabinets and know if i look underneath my cabinets i m not satisfied with the jobs i i did on it because there re splotches yeah but i m glad it s done because it s brighter yeah yeah that s for sure well we uh i just got married about six months ago and we bought a house at the same time so we re i m sitting here in my forty year old house and we re about halfway through the painting process oh lord so uh the only uh i guess the the big discussion just kind of what you were mentioning has been the color we ended up with our our living and dining room are now uh kind of a a light peach color with uh and it s got all the old original hardwood trim and stuff so we ve got the trim in kind of uh kind of an off white and this is really the first uh interior painting project that i ve attacked and it s it s been uh it s been something else to say the least we we had the same type of situation uh the walls were uh uh well they weren t the color difference wasn t so bad but uh there was semigloss underneath uh huh and we put a flat over the top and everywhere you d miss there d be this little bright spot you could see it seems like you could see it through about three layers of paint oh yeah every time the sun would come up in the morning i d see another spot and have to drag out the paint can but uh we ve learned we re we uh we worked we ve worked our way back into the hallway and and we re in the middle of the bathroom now but uh it s it s been quite an adventure the other the other thing that makes it uh a little more difficult we ve got all hardwood floors and uh we we ve learned to be a little more careful about covering up the floors since the since the first time we spent a lot of time on the floor with a tooth toothbrush and what not cleaning up so what are you going to get it off with if you get it on and it s dried well it s it s not too bad it it uh the floors are finished with a polyurethane and it s really not to bad to get off it it we re just using latex and it s not too bad to get it off once it s dried even it it it uh comes off with like a uh huh a mild abrasive pad like a Scotchbrite pad or something like that and water and soap and water so we got pretty lucky on that and it s not scratching your floor because it s so thick oh that s pretty good we painted every room in this house some of them like two three times we have two children no not really but okay yeah and they just they ruin it s just terrible what they do and then i have been coloring my hair and i m real haphazard when i do it so i ve got dye on my bathroom door yeah oh gosh and i haven t figured out how to get that off i guess i ll have to take that door down and really get it good yeah yeah probably so and then we have a two story we did the outside of it one summer that was horrendous i mean i i couldn t stand the back side going up that high on the ladder i could get up on the roof and do that okay yeah yeah but i dread that the next time yeah i we uh our house was painted as part of the purchase contract so we didn t have to mess with that this time but i ve i i grew up on a farm so i i ve i ve messed with outdoor painting a little bit uh but most of that it was done with a sprayer and uh up in the bucket of a loader tractor or something like that so it took a lot of the hassle out and then they re we re not you know you re not nearly as concerned with a barn or a granary or something like that as you would be with your own house uh huh no i wouldn t think so have you guys tackled your ceilings yet uh a little bit yeah yeah oh we got to do that this summer we re dreading it yeah it s like they re dark everything else is white yeah oh gosh yeah just just the opposite of what everybody s uh working towards now now have you thought about this that wherever you buy your paint you need to make sure that that store s not likely to go out of business yeah yeah absolutely yeah we uh we stocked up the first time around but we ve definitely got all the formulas on file and uh we re they ll be there for a while we re we re pretty comfortable with that but yeah it it i m i m real nervous every time i i open a new can i m wondering if i shouldn t buy about twenty gallons at one time and keep it all in a in a wash tub or something somewhere because i m always i m always afraid that the next coat is not going to match uh huh but uh it s gone pretty well it just it it takes it takes some time my problem is while i m not overly proud of it but i m a self proclaimed proclaimed perfectionist and it it takes me a long time to do trim and things like that and i ll find i ll find something as i m going along something not related like like uh i ve gone about changing out all the outlets and switches because they they really didn t match they were a few of them were broken and things like that so i always pick up these little extra tasks as i m doing this and and the painting actually takes probably uh a fourth of the time and i i m always doing all this other stuff and my wife s hollering at me and wondering what else i ve come home with from work this time to to put in a ceiling fan or something strange like that so uh it it it always it it it gets you to look at everything real hard when you you start putting a coat of paint on everything you start to notice where all the dents and scratches and things are everywhere oh but i still feel good the minute i put that paint on even if it has got a dent in it i do yeah yeah it sure makes a difference oh what what else can i tell you about painting oh and i get it all in my hair too do you do that yeah spots in it yeah it s it s been uh we we bought this house with the idea that we were going to spend you know spend a lot of time working on it and uh it was part you know part of the excitement was was getting a good deal on an older house it just it really hadn t been taken care of very well it it was actually it was rented out for a couple of years and things like that so we uh we ended up getting a fairly good deal on it but uh there just isn t enough time i i ve i find myself going to work knowing that that there s a job about half done at home and i really if i would if i d just stay home and finish it i d feel a lot better but uh i m i m starting to learn that there s always something else so that you could once you get done you can always start over and and you make up all kinds of excuses so uh are you having to repair the walls at all uh not a whole lot it they re they re in pretty good condition um as as far as uh major repairs you know lot a lot of little filling holes and nicks and things like that but uh the only the most major things have been uh oh i guess i i moved a couple of outlets and or uh switches i should say they for some reason they put a bathroom light switch in the hallway and uh yeah and i i didn t like that very well so i i moved that but uh um that s smart most of it most of it s in pretty good shape so where do you live uh live in Dallas cause i m in Garland okay okay could you try to call this weekend uh to that switchboard did you keep getting that it was down no no i haven t uh i hadn t tried in fact we were we were planting flowers this weekend so uh i was pretty tied up you didn t yeah but well i ve never tried any other kinds of painting besides on a surface like the house like to paint a picture or anything i don t know i can t think of anything else to say about painting uh huh no that uh that s it hurts your back and it hurts your arm yeah you know it i get a sore i get a sore neck from looking up all the time yeah things like that but uh no that pretty much covers my experiences yeah but you re glad you re doing it right oh yeah most definitely it it just it makes such a difference like i like i say the the overall appearance of this house is what really devalued it so much uh i you know i don t want to put a price on it but i just feel like we re every every gallon of paint adds a tremendous amount of value to the house you know every every time i do something a aside from that it just makes me feel a whole lot better to come home and you know old the walls are clean and they match and all those kinds of things uh huh do you have one of those straight edge things to put underneath when you re doing the baseboards yeah yeah we do it uh it sometimes works and it sometimes doesn t it s i uh when i start doing trim i i ve gotten to where i i tend to freehand it because there there s so many layers of paint on this house after forty years that uh it it s so hard to tell where an edge is anymore and uh on your baseboards yeah yeah they you don t have any carpet down in your house no there s no carpet in the house right now see we ve got carpet and i haven t figured out how you re supposed to paint it on down so that you won t see where you stopped off and still not get it on the carpet because every time you move that edger then it gets the carpet into it um okay well you know um you can t hold it there until it s dried yeah i i ve i ve seen uh they re they make some plastic edging stuff that comes in like three foot lengths and you can uh you can tape them together and and and put
