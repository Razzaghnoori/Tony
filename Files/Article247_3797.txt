 Metabolife Read This No Wait Don t Read This Chatterbox was intrigued by Bruce Orwall s Oct 6 story in the Wall Street Journal about how the diet pill maker Metabolife International Inc was launching a preemptive strike against ABC News 20 20 which is investigating the company As explained in the Journal story and in a full page ad Metabolife took out the same day in the New York Times Metabolife is inviting consumers to view unedited the 20 20 interview of which Metabolife following an increasingly common practice made a videotape of its own on a special screw you ABC News Web site The stunt has generated scads of publicity in the media and has prompted ABC News to make the blustery threat that from now on interview subjects will be forced to sign away their rights to make public whatever it is they tell its intrepid reporters How any interviewee who isn t also guaranteed that the story will be a puff piece could possibly be induced to sign such an agreement remains to be seen Perhaps those who don t sign will be forbidden to take their children to the forthcoming Toy Story sequel Chatterbox believes that sunlight is the best disinfectant for everybody including the press and looks forward to comparing Metabolife s raw footage to 20 20 s segment whenever it airs It has yet to be scheduled Chatterbox clicked on to the Metabolife Web site to give his readers some preview of what the controversy in question is all about Being only human Chatterbox was especially intrigued by the Journal story s claim that in the 20 20 interview Metabolife s chief executive Michael Ellis was asked to address some embarrassing personal baggage his 1990 conviction for using a telephone to facilitate drug trafficking after he was arrested in connection with a methamphetamine lab that was operated out of a house he rented Mr Ellis received five years probation in the case But when Chatterbox actually got to the Metabolife Web site he was confronted with an unbelievably complex user agreement requiring Chatterbox to promise in advance to eschew any reproduction broadcast retransmissions or nontransient storage of the matter contained therein The Web site s contents are only for your personal noncommercial use Hmm Is Web journalism commercial use Chatterbox does get paid to write this column The user agreement went on to clarify Y ou will not access or use or permit others to access or use this website for 1 print video or audio publication broadcast retransmission or any newmedia use italics Chatterbox s In its sole discretion and in addition to any other rights or remedies available to it Metabolife International Inc reserves the right to determine whether the User s is are engaging in Improper Conduct and charge the Registered User whose facilities or access rights have been used for Improper Conduct an Improper Conduct service fee You may not download display reproduce create derivative works from transmit sell distribute or in any way exploit the Site or any portion thereof for any public or commercial use or any news or media use without the express advanced written permission of Metabolife The threat of litigation tends to scare Chatterbox out of his wits and by now Chatterbox wasn t at all sure he wanted to press ahead Instead he phoned Metabolife which referred Chatterbox to its public relations firm Sitrick and Co where a senior associate named Julie Fahn assured Chatterbox that all the legal mumbo jumbo basically is just to make sure that nobody goes off and duplicates the exact videotape we have because Metabolife owns the copyright You can quote the transcript Fahn then passed Chatterbox on to her boss Mike Sitrick who repeated these assurances We re not trying to take what ABC has done here and say NBC you can use parts of Arnold Diaz s interview Er why not What s it to Metabolife Indeed shouldn t Metabolife be thrilled at the idea that NBC News would stick it to a competitor that Metabolife believed was out to get them Oddly neither NBC nor any other broadcast outlet has requested the videotape so far though Time and Newsweek received special permission to run photographs of the Web page in this week s issues Sitrick responded diplomatically that we are hopeful that 20 20 s newscast will be fair and objective To summarize Metabolife wants everybody to see the 20 20 interview But Metabolife says it will sue any reporter who tries to disseminate this information But Metabolife says it isn t really going to sue reporters who disseminate this information It just wants to protect ABC News from its broadcast competitors Or something
