 okay all right there we go yep so what s what s your prediction on North Carolina and Duke well i don t know about North Carolina but well actually North Carolina i think North Carolina s gonna to do pretty good i think they ll go to the finals i mean my gosh uh look who Kansas beat to get to meet North Carolina i mean they they beat uh Arkansas i know Arkansas was good i can t believe and they beat and they beat Indiana they beat Indiana they creamed Indiana i can t yeah i can t believe they beat Arkansas i thought Arkansas would go all the way to the finals well i i thought so too they they just had a letdown in the second half and they couldn t recover yeah i don t know well UNLV they say UNLV may be the greatest amateur team ever they beat Duke s ass last year yeah big time i i ll bet they could hold their own in the NBA yeah think so really seriously i i bet there re some teams they could beat yeah like the Hornets anyone can beat the Hornets yeah possibly yeah actually i m kind of a Lakers fan myself yeah me too i like uh oh the um Magic oh yeah him and Worthy and uh AC Green s pretty good yeah yeah he s good coming off the bench now of course the other they got Sam Perkins um hum and that that helps i m not much of a NBA NBA fan myself oh okay well you remember Sam Perkins when he was in North Carolina don t you oh no sure don t see he was a teammate with James Worthy and Michael Jordan uh huh the the three of those guys were the three pillars of the national championship team North Carolina had back in eighty two i think when Jordan was just a freshman yeah didn t know that yeah in fact uh Jordan hit the winning basket to win by one point with like sixteen seconds to go huh they they gave him the ball he took the shot if he makes it he s a hero if he misses it he s a goat he made it huh well he made it yep hm hm so how about what do you think who do you think s gonna win the final well i really don t think anybody anybody can beat UNLV they they might beat themselves but i don t know they re at such a high level of intensity yeah i watched the they they would have to have a really off day and somebody else would have to have a really on day and if that if both of those happened at the same time you might have an upset yeah they can keep on the pressure all the whole game yep yep they re absolutely relentless pretty good well they re so close to an undefeated undefeated season they can taste it and they wanna make history so i don t think they re gonna lack for motivation yeah Duke ll be mighty mad though well i mean it s it s no disgrace to lose in the final four oh yeah well the disgrace they won t lose lose last year well UNLV s kind of in a different league from everybody else it it s kind of similar to back when UCLA was winning seven titles in a row from sixty seven to seventy three back then they they called the invitational um yeah with Kareem well with him yeah and with Bill Walton and they used to call it the uh the UCLA invitational because they figured everybody else is just coming to just to be there yeah been a while since they had the straight winner yeah i i don t know that any one team s gonna be able to dominate for that many years in a row huh uh partly because the really outstanding many of the really outstanding players leave college before they turn seniors yeah like Jordan so you don t yeah yeah so you don t really get to keep the the nucleus of your best talent for the whole four years huh well this has been fun i ve enjoyed talking with you okay God bless and you have a good day now bye bye all right you too thanks bye
