 okay Diana uh on capital punishment in our state they give the death penalty for shooting of a policeman uh huh and i believe also in shooting of uh rape i mean killing a rape victim or i mean someone in the process of rape uh huh uh huh and i don t know what else i don t really remember what else uh huh but how do you feel what what do you think about it i think it s justified uh yeah yeah very much so i agree i i agree you know i i think it should be in other cases other than just shooting a policeman yeah oh i do too i do too i mean i think they re doing their duty but i think if they re going to come out and kill somebody else then they deserve it they ought to get it for killing a civilian just as easily as a policeman yeah i agree i don t know i heard something on the news the other night they were talking about that s right i agree uh oh i know what it was it was in our in our little local paper our little Lewisville paper that comes out twice a week on the front page every week uh there s a little thing at the bottom that it s like a call in survey that says you know do you think so and so and then you call this number and you press like one for yes and two for no right uh huh and one of the things the questions the other day uh this last paper and i haven t seen the results of it i m anxious to was do you think that um capital punishment ought to apply to drug dealers oh i think which i thought was a real interesting question right right did you see Sixty Minutes tonight by any chance no i didn t huh uh well they were showing a segment on a man in Philadelphia that s going after the drug dealers he s just a civilian he s a black man and he just got fed up with it uh huh uh huh and he said he s had his house broken into and windows smashed and his car stolen three times and everything trying to keep keep him quiet but he s organizing people uh huh and they re going out and marching on the corners and taking taking back their territory you know i think that s what it s going to take though i think so i think i really do i yeah it s going to take uh you know the the police i i think i don t think can do it uh can do it alone you know that s right i think you re right it s going to take uh it s going to take all of us getting together i m sorry i m trying to my kid is asking for a kiss and a hug so he can go to bed it s going to take all of us you know getting together and just saying we are not going to take it any more right we won t allow this in our neighborhood and it said they re going to other neighborhoods from there that s right that s right uh huh and then quite often they ll get shot because uh they re horning in on somebody else s territory that s right that s right uh i think they said forty one had been shot out of one church in the last year my gosh the only thing about the death penalty and and i know that that they try to be careful and they try to be sure but these people are on death row for like twenty years you know and you know if if right i know it you know i i think to be you know convicted being convicted is one thing you know and that s and that s great if they re convicted if they re sentenced to death to me you could not sentence them to death unless the case was for sure i mean it had well it goes all through the state it goes all through the state supreme court system before they re right right and and by the time it gets there and they ve been convicted and then they ve been sentenced to death uh huh then it should happen yeah they re sure i mean there s no doubt i mean i there can be no shadow of a doubt in my mind there has to be no shadow of a doubt to get that penalty so once they ve gotten the penalty and there is no doubt do it that s right you know just right i don t i guess i mean that s may sound that sounds cold but gosh you know we re keeping you know we re we re keeping these men in prison for fifteen or twenty years on death row uh huh that s right and not doing anything with them and it s costing us a heck of a lot of money and that s terrible to look at it that way but yeah it is i know but that that s the way it is yeah if the crime was bad enough that they were sentenced to death then do it you know uh we had one in Virginia that was sentenced to death and the execution was to have taken place a few weeks ago i don t know if there was anything in your paper about it i didn t notice it huh uh and there was a lot of protest even Robert Redford you know was protesting this guy s execution so the governor backed down and i was so mad the crime was horrible his crime was just horrible gosh yeah oh man yeah and those kind of people i m sorry you don t reform them you know i really believe you don t no i don t think huh uh if they re the kind of people that commit these excuse me grotesque crimes and have done it over and over and over again you don t reform those kind of people hum um and being under the influence of drugs is no excuse to me no no and i don t know the same thing goes with some of these insanity pleas you know well if you re insane enough that you can go right yeah cut twelve people up into little bitty pieces and bury them in your back yard then are you can can you be helped you know i have i have my doubts you know that s right yeah yeah i do too i you know i don t know i think there s a point some of these plea bargains and all this kind of stuff that they do it s just it just gets out of hand and i understand that you know that you know my husband and i right wasn t it Lewisburg that had a lot of uh bad things happening just in the last couple of weeks or was it not no no huh uh no maybe it was i think it was the South East area from Dallas my daughter my daughter lives down in Rowlett and she was telling me about it yeah i can t remember what the town was some little area oh really yeah oh really yeah we ve had several here lately and it there were several of them in North Dallas and then it started kind of happening a couple of places in South Dallas and that s maybe what you were talking about men breaking in uh to houses and taking or a man they they think it s the same person taking uh little girls right straight out of their beds at night an d you know breaking in obviously watching them in the house because they re breaking into the right window oh gosh and that s the last they saw yeah you know the little girls bedrooms and taking them out putting them in a car and driving them out and taking them out and molesting them and then bringing them back and throwing them back in their own front yards oh gee is that right i hadn t heard about that yes that is happened i think there s been i think there s been like six or seven of them over the last like probably eight eight or nine months gosh they don t kill them they just molest they don t kill them no they ve taken and they re all like um like nine anywhere from nine to twelve years old i think is what they ve been gosh gosh and he s taken them and and raped them and then brought them right back and just kind of thrown them out of the car in their front yard and boy that s scary isn t it oh can you imagine because it it happens in the middle of the night so the parent yeah you know these parents didn t know this the the kid was gone until the kid is knocking on the door screaming let me in you know can you imagine yeah oh boy yeah you wouldn t even dare put these signs in the window little emblems in the window saying child in this room in case of fire you know have you seen those shoot i you know i ve got one of those in Brian s room i never even thought about that yeah yeah God maybe i ll take it out i hadn t even thought about it yeah it is that s terrible well it s really bad that you have to be you know we we were over at a neighbors tonight and and Brian my little boy is only is just a little over two and their little boy is like five you know so there s a big difference and they were playing in the back yard and we were getting ready to leave and i went out in the back yard to get Brian and the boys were gone and the back fence was open you know uh huh oh gosh oh gosh yeah and she didn t act like it bothered her at all oh this happens all the time and we walked through the fence out the alleys or come to the back of the house you know and walked and i looked down both directions of the alley and i saw neither one of them and uh uh huh yeah and oh and she was like oh God he does this all the time you know where are you you know screaming J D and you know my heart was in my throat you know and uh he Brian was two houses down oh oh boy and he s five shoot i guess so gee you know and he you know i don t know i know parents around here just let their kids run everywhere and i just can t do that yeah there was a little girl picked up in Rowlett from uh from her front yard and her dad was working in the back yard and had just left her few minutes in the front yard and somebody apparently drove up and took her and they never saw her again oh God oh man this is too scary that is just too scary you know i let Brian play here in the back yard and we ve got yeah there s two gates that go into the back yard and we ve got one of those big eight foot privacy fences and one of the gates has a padlock on it and then the other gate just has one of those slide bar things but it s on the inside it s right uh huh uh huh you know you d have to climb like come over they d have to come over the fence they could not open a gate you know and i still feel a little uneasy about him playing back there you know i mean if i don t hear him playing i mean i i get up and come out and look out the window real often you know so uh huh right yeah watch yeah yeah i don t blame you it s really scary that you have to be that scared about your kids but i mean you do better safe than sorry um hum and if they find who s doing that to those little girls as far as i m concerned he could he could fry yes to put it very bluntly he could fry yes yes because sometimes there are crimes worse than murder fry yeah right you know i and i believe that and this is one of them because these little girls will never be the same yeah yeah huh uh that s terrible never be the same so i don t know it s it s really scary and i don t know what to and i don t know what needs to be done you know it seems like there s no room in jails to put them in jail and when they do put them in there you know were i m taking a business law class at night and the guy that teaches it is a practicing criminal attorney and oh gosh so he comes in and tell us all these bizarre cases you know and he said you can pretty much you know if you ever get on a jury you know you re not told this but if you ever get on a jury you can pretty much guess whatever you sentence them to they re going to serve about a quarter it s going to be reduced right uh huh they they ll serve they ll serve a quarter of it so if you want them to stay in prison for fifteen years don t sentence them to fifteen years sentence them to a hundred you know because then they ll serve fifteen or twenty so which is really i don t know yeah yeah yeah it s just not it just doesn t seem right no it doesn t it doesn t they just get out you know there was a thing on well what are we going to do about it How i mean how can it be changed well i don t know unless the legislature will do something and they don t seem to that s the thing and you know we re just going to have to adopt a a completely different attitude uh huh and we re going to have to say if you commit this crime and if we re sure you commit this crime you are going to be sentenced to death period yeah period and do it you know and if you commit this crime you will be in prison for the rest of your life we re not going to say we re going to put you there for the rest of your life and let you out in fifteen years we re really going to do it you know it s just the system has just yeah right and and i understand they re doing it because the prisons are full but somewhere we ve got to come up with some money to build to build more you know and keep these people in them you know right i think so yeah yeah i think it would be worth it everybody would they were i was watching a show about this the other night and you know they were like in i think it was on Forty Eight Hours or Morning
