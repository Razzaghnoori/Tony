 all righty so uh do you think Russia s still a threat well i guess i m maybe naive but i never did feel that Russia was a big threat to us i mean obviously there s the the the possibility of or was the possibility of war there you go uh but i somehow think that war is one of those things that that maybe is inevitable but uh i don t look at it as a threat in the same sense that that i think this question was meant what about you well i think have have you ever read the book nineteen eighty four yes okay you know like how uh these two there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other uh huh right and you could picture it as being Russia versus the US during during the whole time and what they would do is they would get their prisoners and kill them as soon as they got them right because the people there could realize that they were the same as as themselves you know the prisoners of wars were were the same as the people living in that country right and you didn t want that to happen and to me it had always been that way i mean what happens is you have a government right and this government controls everything right yeah and then you have the people inhabiting the country and these people have nothing to do with the government itself and these people are the same as you are right right and what goes on is that every time somebody attacks a country supposedly US or Russia attacks a country it s not going to be within the borders of the US or Russia itself like i was telling people i m really mad because the whole thing in the Middle East this was going on in Lithuania in Lithuania they they were announced to be a separate country but yet the the government that s in Moscow told its army to go in there and get those people and the US didn t go in there and try to save those people right you know it s like you re not going to go in there and say no listen there s a separate country why because you re going into the border uh huh uh huh right once you get into the border then there s a threat but what happens is you don t mess with us we won t mess with you but let s mess with the neutral countries uh huh uh huh you know and now it s like you know they re saying other people were were i guess other leaders were still crazier about it you know like other people you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there but Russia has never been known for throwing an atomic bomb anywhere uh huh uh huh and the US has you know it s like they it seems like they can their their army or whatever can can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and do do the job with uh you know less suffering uh huh uh huh you know but i think i think the thing is is that there the thing like they were saying they go you know like Libya could start a nuclear war because of whoever is behind the button but not the USSR the USSR wouldn t do it right uh huh because they got too much at stake uh huh but i guess there was concern uh that Iraq Iraq would use you know nonconventional warheads with with the chemical weapons and things but yet it didn t happen i mean why not yeah well my my point of view to that is is that it would have had so much i mean the attack would have been so complete on Iraq if they had i mean the first you can imagine the first uh chemical weapon used uh huh that would have meant a total attack of the Iraq country within you know three hours of when the weapon was shot oh so you think it was fear that kept Iraq from using it but yet the right and what happens is what happens is suppose they get Saddam Hussein which they eventually will he s got one less thing to go against him uh huh uh huh i mean if he were to use that he might as well commit suicide because he s going to be captured and you know uh huh but the US also makes a lot of uh you know treaties with other people like saying okay if you give up then you can come live in our country and we ll take care of you like Marcos right right we ll overthrow you but yet you can still come live here you know right i don t think we ve done that to Saddam Hussein yet uh no i think that s that s that s not very likely no but yet you know as as the parallel Russia is that Saddam Hussein is using the chemical warfare on his own people and i guess that makes sense what you said that yeah uh within their own borders they feel freer to do what what they feel necessary right right yeah and uh you know there s there s just you know like people will go like they like the U S goes and goes into Panama and what see i don t believe in war that s my thing i don t believe that anybody should die uh huh you know and so then you know you have because what happens is suppose i m i go to war and i m holding a gun and i m just looking at myself holding a gun and whoever shoots first survives you know right but that same person also has a family and you know his parents are going to cry and you know life ends there and to me that s ridiculous uh huh uh huh uh huh you know i mean i just don t believe it i think there are other ways to fix it even though sometimes there aren t but uh huh it s pretty hard to think that you know people are just going to shoot each other down and it s legal in a situation like that you know uh huh well or that at that it resolves anything in the end that that negotiations couldn t resolve yeah yeah i mean i mean Saddam Hussein lost so much money during the war that it was ridiculous and he all he was trying to do was make money at the beginning so uh huh uh huh and keep his power but well uh huh well it sounds like neither one of us thinks that the Soviet Union is a real threat to the US no i i don t think so i think uh they re getting they re especially getting their life back together now because a lot of things that you saw on TV a lot of uh inhabitants of Russia would love to stay in their country just as long as they were able to express what they wanted to a lot of like dancers and stuff like that right uh huh they said that they wouldn t leave Russia unless Russia told them that they couldn t travel anymore and compete uh huh so it must be a beautiful country it s just that you know they won t let you get out and when you want to get out of the country that s what you want to do right right so oh well i got to go to class now okay well thanks bye bye nice talking to you bye bye
