        start it      sure   okay uh basically i work for the government and our health insurance plan seems to be okay but it seems the benefits are are eroding and the cost of insurance goes up        uh i dont know why the post people post office people pay one third out of their paycheck for the same insurance that were getting uh right now im in were physicians health plan and that costs about thirty five bucks a paycheck but yet the postal people will only pay less than ten dollars a paycheck   its called the union      yes probably yes full payment one percent and im sure not everybody has theyre probably getting their  worth and                 MasterCards cheaper too   well    i am all for universal health insurance um being up here in New York um        our local Blue Cross Blue Shield people have im im now paying every month because im selfemployed one hundred and three dollars a month for basic health care coverage um actually im sorry its more than that well its four hundred dollars a quarter   umhum      so its probably a little more than that      gosh yeah thats a steep one   and           frankly i dont i think that if we can take whats been done in Canada and given every body a choice as far as who they want for their health care frankly i think that the reason that were in so much trouble and and and its such an anticompetitive um uh stance right now as far as doing battle with these other companies is that we are really burdening our American corporations with health care costs which they have to build in to the price of their product whereas if you go to some one of these overseas countries Japan for example where the government pays all of that   umhum   the you dont have to build that in to the cost of the product um they usually nail the product you know you pay as as an individual        versus um having a company dragged down by these insane health care costs and i think that we should have a health care system in this country that everybody can get access to and uh have it universal      i agree there because i you know Saturday afternoon youre playing baseball and you break your arm you dont know what its going to cost you for the xrays and everything else like that if you dont have some type of health plan that you can afford and im sure theres a lot of people that live paycheck to paycheck to where they cannot  and afford fifty bucks every paycheck for a health insurance plan and i know i and when i was in Germany i was in the service but at the same time there was an agreement that if you went to a hospital there in Germany that they knew they could bill uncle Sam for that hospital care so they didnt give us any hassle  medical care there and my brother and my dad are over there and its a great health insurance plan for them                 i think thats going to cost us money as far as taxes if our government gets into it because they all havent shown a real good record for management of any kind of program   yeah yeah i you know i i wouldnt even mind so much if they had a um corporation that is financed        through the government or have some sort of there can be competition as long as there is a universal plan i dont oppose i do not im not for eliminating all private health insurance whatsoever but um you know but if if you have the ability to pay for that you can pay based on your income as a percentage and uh more fairly and equitably distribute the cost across a wide spectrum right now you know the people working this country is half the problem right there and were seeing thats not a lot of it is private sector too um i you know its the government is always attacked for not being able to do anything properly           this is one example i dont think the private sectors doing much better though   im pretty ignorant on taxes but on selfemployed do you get any kind of credits for health insurance      i get a credit this year and last year because the government specifically said i could get a credit        but the uh but it is its going to expire which means im paying uh i get a sum a sum uh sum of the money back but um not all of it of course um im in a worst off position than someone who is employed who gets their health health care taken care of by their employer um because i have to also obtain my insurance from is a third party middle man type deal i have to go to go the small business service bureau and pay eighty dollars a year just for the right to buy health insurance    works well for them but its horrible for me   um        you know the consumer is going to pay in the end no matter what happens so   yeah i i i i   cost hidden or not             you just cant its just its sky rocketing i mean were seeing increases every year ten to fifteen percent and you know its its gotten way out of hand and then and then you have these
