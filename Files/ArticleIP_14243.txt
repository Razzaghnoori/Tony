 Movies Varsity Blues Paramount Pictures Critics say this film is pretty fun for a formula sports flick brisk and wholehearted and smarter than you expect Owen Gleiberman Entertainment Weekly Dawson s Creek star James Van Der Beek plays a second string quarterback thrust into the spotlight of a football obsessed Texas town when the star is injured The benefits that come with the new position free beer cheerleaders slathered in whipped cream get lots of screen time and at points the film is almost a poor man s Porky s Andy Seiler USA Today John Anderson pans it in the Los Angeles Times a trashy little movie about drinking football and drinking saying it pretends to moralize about the very behavior it milks for every giggle it can get Get all the Van Der Beek cake you can handle on this fan site At First Sight MGM Critics are down on this based on a true Oliver Sacks story of a man Val Kilmer who regains his sight after an operation encouraged by his sighted girlfriend Mira Sorvino Rod Dreher of the New York Post is scathing dismissing it as ooey gooey schmoopie slop and ersatz romantic tapioca and comparing the personality of Kilmer s character to that of Snuggles the fabric softener bear Not everyone s this harsh but the film has only one true supporter the Los Angeles Times Kevin Thomas who deems it an exceptionally touching and provocative love story This fan site has lots of stills In Dreams DreamWorks Most agree that this dismayingly schlocky and literal minded thriller Gleiberman Entertainment Weekly is leavened only by a fine performance by Annette Bening as a

with McMurtry s finest work every page is as welcome as a letter from home Kyle Smith People Others think the extended musing on the depression of 62 year old oilman Duane Moore focuses so much on his malaise as to become boring but most agree with Malcolm Jones of Newsweek both heartbreaking and hilarious sometimes on the same page Read more about McMurtry in this Newsweek article The Intuitionist by Colson Whitehead Anchor Books Critics describe this detective novel the author s first as part Thomas Pynchon part Ralph Ellison Dan Cryer New York Newsday and praise Whitehead as a refreshingly original voice The story follows Lila Mae Watson the first black elevator inspector in a New York like metropolis in the 1940s Watson is an intuitionist one of a minority of inspectors who judges elevators by intuition as opposed to the empiricists who inspect in the traditional fashion The twisting plot explores race relations with elevators serving as metaphors for social mobility and
