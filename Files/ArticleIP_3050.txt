 Accidental Writer No author s name not even Shakespeare s has the talismanic effect of Chekhov s Speak that name to any intelligent reader or theatergoer and his eye turns inward though not away and his mouth drifts into a soft private smile Chekhov belongs to everyone who knows him Thus a new serious biography has a commanding basic importance And Anton Chekhov A Life does more than fulfill basics The author Donald Rayfield who teaches Russian literature at the University of London and has previously written two critical books on Chekhov spent three years in Russian archives going through among other items 5 000 letters written by Chekhov 7 000 letters addressed to him These materials had not been thoroughly examined even by Russian scholars because the Soviet authorities had wanted to keep Chekhov quasicanonized The result of Rayfield s research is a book that amplifies much that we have known and adds much in color and facet that has been omitted or only sketched up to now Rayfield s prose is of the packhorse variety bearing along its load of information sturdily but not with much grace Like many biographers of our day empowered by new research technologies he is reluctant to discard any of what he has been able to harvest He includes minor stuff merely because he has culled it Do we really need to know the eventual fate of a shopboy who once worked for Chekhov s father But Rayfield gives us a more rounded portrait of Chekhov than we have ever had less sanitized and he deepens the flow of paradoxes that runs throughout The first paradox rests in the first facts Chekhov s origins His grandfather Egor was a slave The usual term serf gilds it slightly In 1841 Egor managed to buy freedom for himself and his family Egor s son Pavel became a shopkeeper in Taganrog struggling but free and there Pavel s son Anton was born in 1860 Anton certainly never forgot his origins He once described himself as a young man squeezing drop by drop the slave out of himself and waking one morning feeling that real human blood not a slave s is flowing through his veins This grim self knowledge begets contradiction The origins of some writers explain to a degree their subjects and styles Turgenev the scion of elegance reflected it in his work Gorky the child of difficulties wrote much about the wretched But Chekhov out of a childhood that one of his brothers called crushing anguish ranged the full field of society and always with a delicacy that still makes the world gasp Writing the art of writing entered Chekhov s life tangentially In 1879 aided by a grant from the Taganrog city council Chekhov went to Moscow where most of his family had already moved to study medicine To help pay his way through medical school he began to write sketches and stories for newspapers and magazines Within a very few years he was established as a writer In 1884 he qualified as a physician and he never completely gave up medicine as his short life raced to a close He died in 1904 at 44 But paradoxically what had started as an adjunct to his medical education became his chief support fairly handsome support too The stories ascended breathtakingly in quality and varied greatly in length though he never wrote anything in grand Russian novel proportions Rayfield says in his preface Biography is not criticism and he assuredly keeps his word Each of the major stories gets only a small identification tag from him of not much critical value Possibly he deals more helpfully with them in his critical books unread by me But this critical tagging becomes even less helpful when he deals with the kind of writing that Chekhov came to in his last years drama Chekhov s major plays Uncle Vanya The Seagull Three Sisters and The Cherry Orchard have links with his antecedent stories as well as with events in his life Rayfield clarifies these connections But he does not come near conveying that in the whole of Western drama there is no precedent for the style and texture of these quietly towering plays For an exquisite illumination of these matters see Richard Gilman s recent study Chekhov s Plays An Opening Into Eternity But vividly Rayfield presents the man tall energetic socially scintillating The famous sought him out The venerable Tolstoy a secular saint in his time called on him more than once Tchaikovsky contemplated writing an opera with him at one time Women pursued him feverishly Yet another paradox he was a frequent patron of brothels Involved though he was with a literary life he never abandoned medicine as long as his health permitted He worked heroically when a cholera epidemic struck the area of his country home In 1890 he spent 81 days crossing Siberia to the penal colony of Sakhalin so he could spend three months there studying the health conditions about which he wrote a very full report Another paradox contradicting his broad humanism and also contradictory within itself is his attitude toward Jews a subject that Rayfield traces throughout this book On the one hand Chekhov believed that Russian Jews could never be truly Russian he categorized every new acquaintance as Jew or non Jew in his letters he frequently used a slurring term for Jews Yet one of his dearest friends was a Jewish painter who greatly influenced him aesthetically When the Dreyfus case was raging clearly the result of anti Semitism in the French army Chekhov then in France was a fiery Dreyfusard He was even engaged for a time to a Jewish woman Rayfield assists us with these contradictions by saying that by the standards of his time Chekhov was a judophile The overarching paradox of his life lucidly detailed by Rayfield is the state of Chekhov s health and his attitude toward it By his middle 20s he knew that he suffered from tuberculosis and he coughed blood increasingly as the years went on When he married in 1901 he and his wife Olga Knipper of the Moscow Art Theater went directly from the ceremony to a honeymoon in a sanitarium Why did this man himself a physician pay so relatively little attention to his disease The only comprehensible explanation is that the vocation that had burrowed in next to medicine had taken control had insisted In 1894 he said in a letter to a friend Not for a minute am I free of the thought that I must am obliged to write Write write and write Chekhov was an ingenious phrase maker with many of the phrases scattered in his letters All gynaecologists are idealists One line unintended as an epigram stings unforgettably In 1897 he was in Moscow staying at the Great Moscow Hotel when he began to cough blood profusely He sent a note to a doctor he knew Bleeding Great Moscow No 5 Chekhov The terseness the immense taciturn gravity makes the note truly Chekhovian In those circumstances Dr Astrov in Uncle Vanya might have written it
