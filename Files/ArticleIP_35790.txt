 The Crime of Wine As Internet companies spin into the financial stratosphere Wall Street and the business press speak with awe of the revolutionary implications of the Web Issue after issue of Forbes Fortune and Business Week detail in awe struck tones the hundreds of millions sometimes even billions raised by Net companies A new staple is the interview with the Internet expert call him the I guru The editors will ask meekly Dr Chopra what industries do you think will be affected by the Internet To which the I guru sighs pauses and explains The real question Charlie is what industries will not be affected Frankly I can t think of a single one Well I can wine The booze business might well end up being one of the few areas of American life undisturbed by the great Internet revolution The buying and selling of wine across state borders is still illegal in 28 states including New York where I live It s a pity because the wine business is perfectly suited to e commerce No store could possibly stock even 10 percent of the 10 000 odd wines produced by America s 1 800 wineries not to mention the vineyards of France Italy and Australia It would be a godsend if wine buyers could do a Web search for bottles of say Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc a hard to find 16 world class white wine from New Zealand In my mind s eye I see myself using a search engine similar to the Advanced Book Exchange which allows readers to track down secondhand books at hundreds of shops across North America I can just see myself clicking the mouse to comparison shop and then score a bottle from a San Francisco store four from a Texas shop and 12 from a New York outlet I d settle for being able to buy wine from mainstream Internet merchants such as 1 800 WINE SHOP or Wine com which used to be Virtual Vineyards Alas only 12 states most of them in the West have completely legalized such acts of capitalism between consenting adults The laws regulating direct wine sales were rarely enforced until recently but a new zeal is in the air Buying a single bottle of wine from out of state is a third degree felony in Kentucky Georgia and Florida and is punishable with fines of up to 2 000 and jail time And Orrin Hatch senior senator from the parched state of Utah has introduced a bill that would allow federal courts to prosecute offenders Indeed Hatch was moved to federalize this crime precisely because new technologies like the Internet make it easier to buy wine nationally horrors Rep Joe Scarborough R Fla introduced a similar bill in the House which passed by a hefty margin At the risk of making a one way trip to Rikers Island I must take the Fifth about my wine purchases senator I spent a couple of weeks this summer surfing the Web for vino Some wine stores keep their lists online but none of New York City s big operations Sherry Lehamn Zachy s and Morrell s do Many of the Web wine lists I browsed were so outdated that 20 percent of the wine I wanted to order was out of stock One major California wine merchant I spoke to said that the Internet isn t having much effect on his business because people from most big states can t use it to order wines If Internet wine buying was uniformly decriminalized and there was a genuine nationwide market on the other hand the system would be more creative and efficient I had better luck ordering from two shops outside New York the Corkscrew in Springfield Ill and K L Wine Merchants a widely known and well regarded place of San Francisco as well as Wine com an online only store in Napa The sites are pretty well run but again they simply don t compare with those selling books CDs clothes and baby wares The wines were shipped to a friend in Washington state one of the enlightened places where e wines are legal Precisely how I obtained the wines is a matter of don t ask don t tell I deliberately chose wines that could travel badly delicate white Bordeaux Champagne Pinot Grigio and also some harder to find wines such as Californian Italian wines Sangioveses The wines were received in Seattle within a week of ordering They were all very well packed in special thermacol wine molds As a result almost miraculously most of the wines held up even though they were shipped in 90 degree weather The Champagne Billecart Salmon s special K L bottling 26 99 went slightly off losing fruit and gaining acidity the cheaper white Bordeaux Pont de Brion Blanc 13 99 was a decent steely Sauvignon Blanc that stood up to the trip nicely The more expensive Chateau Smith Haut Lafite 22 95 was superb delicate flowery and yet crisp But in an hour or two it began fading signs of jet lag The Sangioveses were the most pleasant surprise Shaffer 15 and a Virtual Vineyards special bottling 13 Both were delicious with the pointed flavors of Italian Chianti and the ripeness of California s clime mixed together American Chianti style wines are going to be the next trend in Californian winemaking Back to the puritans Why do the new prohibitionists oppose Internet wine They claim two concerns First like most new legislation in America it has been passed for the benefit of the children States need to ensure that minors are not provided with unfettered access to alcohol Hatch explained He trots out the usual anecdote masquerading as evidence a 13 year old boy once ordered beer off the Internet In fact there is little danger that teen agers are going to order unusual wines from distant wineries wait days for them to arrive arrange to have their parents out of the house when they do and then what Throw a Claret keg party California s State Bureau of Alcohol has received exactly one complaint of an Internet sale to a minor in recent years Second it s for the Constitution The 21 st Amendment which repealed prohibition allows states to regulate the transportation of intoxicating liquors Indeed Hatch s bill is titled The 21 st Amendment Enforcement Act But the protections of the 21 st Amendment are actually quite thin The language of most state laws would seem to violate the Constitution s interstate commerce clause which facilitated the creation of a national economy Judges are increasingly coming to this view At the very least it means that the restrictions do not have the halo of constitutional protection The 21 st Amendment s intent was to give the states the power to prosecute the Mafia s involvement in the liquor trade But because much of the Mafia s interest in booze died with the repeal of prohibition what keeps these laws alive is politics Liquor regulation is a case study in the manipulation of politics by powerful lobbies The regulations in force are maintained and strengthened because distributors wholesalers and large wineries benefit from them and they are organized and politically powerful Over the years their lobbies have been effective at working with local cranks to regulate the minutiae of the wine business In 15 states in America grocery stores can t sell wine In Colorado half bottles of wine are illegal but in Florida oversized bottles are illegal And so on The single most bizarre law which banned giving wine to dogs in Chicago has recently been repealed Those who lose out are small and up and coming wineries specialty producers and of course consumers who would have more choice and lower prices The entire setup has an anti competitive anti entrepreneurial flavor that rewards political lobbying rather than good business practices Sen Hatch seems to recognize this when he says If there is a problem with the system we need to fix the system not break the laws For the moment however the fix is in for the consumer
