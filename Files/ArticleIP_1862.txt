 Edgar Bronfman Edgar Bronfman The Edgar Bronfmans senior and junior are always great theater and never more than in the past few weeks Edgar Bronfman Sr in his role of Aged Wisdom has just published Good Spirits The Making of a Businessman a memoir brimming with self congratulatory tales of his business acumen and generosity When he s not patting himself on the back he has no trouble finding people to do it for him Thanks to his relentless and ongoing pursuit of Nazi loving Swiss bankers admirers have dubbed him only half jokingly the King of the Jews Edgar Bronfman Jr Youthful Folly meanwhile has been busy running Seagram the Bronfman managed liquor conglomerate into the ground Three years ago he liquidated Seagram s 9 billion stake in DuPont to buy the entertainment giant MCA now Universal April has been a horrific month for Universal Three of its top executives were sacked last week It has released flop after flop The Jackal Primary Colors Mercury Rising and there is no relief on the horizon Universal doesn t have a summer blockbuster to compete with Godzilla and Armageddon Edgar Jr keeps promising that Universal will turn fabulous profits in the next few years but no one is buying Hollywood is overflowing with rumors that someone anyone is planning to buy Universal away from Seagram and run it properly Seagram stock dragged down by Universal is stagnating through the biggest bull market in history DuPont stock on the other hand has more than doubled in value since Edgar Jr sold Seagram s DuPont interest This has cost Seagram s shareholders more than 9 billion Usually a few billion dollars in the bank inoculates you against bad press but Edgar Jr has been designated the movie industry s official idiot a 42 year old child who s squandering his family and his shareholders fortune on romantic Tinseltown fantasies There is a feeling that any real media mogul Michael Eisner Barry Diller Sumner Redstone Rupert Murdoch could eat Edgar Jr for lunch and still have plenty of room for dessert A certain aura of creeping decay does surround the Bronfmans and it is tempting to view them as a study in dynastic decline Sam Bronfman the family patriarch and Edgar Sr s father was an utterly implacable businessman the Atilla of liquor The child of Russian Jewish immigrants Sam bought Canadian distilleries and seedy hotels during the 20s then cashed in on American Prohibition He supplied bootleggers and gangsters with booze Meyer Lansky was a customer When Prohibition was lifted Sam was one of the most powerful distillers in North America and for the next 30 years he bullied employees and terrorized rivals to make Seagram an international liquor powerhouse The first generation Bronfman was entrepreneurial and ruthless The second generation was managerial and generous Under Edgar Sr Seagram expanded overseas and extended itself into real estate and oil Sound financial practices and organized marketing campaigns replaced Sam s seat of the pants management Sam had concentrated power in himself Edgar Sr learned to delegate it Edgar Sr also made the Bronfmans the most celebrated name in Jewish philanthropy Since the late 70s he and his brother Charles have been distributing their fortune to Jewish causes endowing professorships buildings and scholarships in the United States and Israel I challenge you to find an American student who studied in Israel and received no Bronfman aid He also appointed himself the Jewish ambassador to the world He paid off the World Jewish Congress debt took over its presidency in 1981 and used it as his platform for action His wealth and fame were an ax He pressured Soviet leaders to release Jewish dissidents He and the WJC exposed Kurt Waldheim s Nazi past in the mid 80s Edgar Sr harassed and condemned the former U N secretary general so effectively that Waldheim tried to sue him For the last three years Edgar Sr has been hunting Swiss bankers who profited from Nazi evil and Jewish sorrow He recruited Sen Al D Amato to hold hearings on Swiss misdeeds persuaded the Clinton administration to investigate and eventually forced the Swiss to pony up 7 billion to compensate Jewish victims If there is a defining quality of the third generation it appears to be self indulgence Edgar Jr skipped college for showbiz using his family money to open doors The doors should not have opened He produced a couple of bad movies and wrote even worse songs He also eloped with an actress In his mid 20s after a movie flop he returned to Seagram as heir apparent Edgar Jr soldiered along there during the 80s He was a competent liquor executive but his love of Hollywood never wavered Then his father handed him the company According to Good Spirits Edgar Jr felt DuPont was a boring investment Though DuPont supplied most of Seagram s profits Seagram had a minority not a controlling stake in the chemical company Edgar Jr wanted to be in movies an information business not a raw materials one First he bid for Time Warner amassing 15 percent of its stock in an aborted takeover In 1995 he closed the romantic but costly Universal deal But the saga of dynastic decline is not quite so simple The father is not quite the icon he seems and the son is not quite the flake Edgar Jr is mocked for his playboy instincts but it s Edgar Sr who has been married five times to four different women Edgar Jr is the Hollywood mogul but it s Edgar Sr who is bullying and grandiose Edgar Jr is soft spoken and self effacing Edgar Sr deplores the assimilation of Jews as a silent Holocaust but he barely observes the Jewish religion married three non Jews and named his son after himself a major Jewish no no Edgar Jr is pilloried for dragging a liquor company into the film industry but Edgar Sr did it first He tried to take over a movie studio in the late 60s and even ran MGM briefly Critics obsessed with Edgar Jr s infatuation with movies have missed his real Hollywood problem Edgar Jr s failing is not that he s too romantic about the movies but that he s too rational about them To wit Earlier this month he outraged the industry by proposing that theaters charge higher prices for more expensive movies Why he asked should you pay the same amount to see a 2 million movie as you would to see a 200 million one Analysts and movie types hooted with derision that s like charging for a piece of art based on how much bronze or paint was used sneered one Edgar Jr wants to treat movies like any other product If a movie costs more to produce you should charge more for it From a CEO s perspective movies are unreliable No one can predict if a film will make 100 million or lose it Studio share prices are erratic because there are no guaranteed earnings A studio that makes a killing this year may get killed next year People in Hollywood accept this instability as the cost of doing business Bronfman doesn t at least not yet Most of his moves at Universal such as his 100 million re engineering project seem directed toward making movies behave like well liquor He wants to find the secret rational formula that will connect movie costs to movie revenues It s an impossible task The formula doesn t exist Movie audiences will always be more fickle than whiskey drinkers and movie directors will always be less reliable than whiskey blenders So Edgar Jr will fail in Hollywood but when he does it won t be the failure of a romantic It will be the failure of someone much less interesting a businessman
