 Brushed Off About 15 years ago painter Chuck Close went out to Springs Long Island to meet Willem de Kooning one of the greatest American artists of this century As Close describes him de Kooning was a wreck Stooped and vacant eyed shuffling around in pajamas the aged artist couldn t identify friends or participate in conversation He drifted away from his guests to the television where Close found him channel surfing staring at the procession of silent images as they blinked past his once legendary attention span splintered into nothingness Before Close left de Kooning s wife Elaine suggested that Bill show Close his recent paintings Nervously Close followed de Kooning into the famous hangarlike studio As de Kooning crossed the threshold a transformation took place He straightened up His eyes brightened He began speaking articulately about each of the paintings in turn He modeled the air with his hands making the beautiful precise gestures that earlier visitors had described He was himself Or rather as Close realized he was two selves De Kooning the man had long since disintegrated Asked a factual question he was helpless ignorant of the date of where he lived But de Kooning the artist was still healthy He would continue to paint for nearly a decade long after he had lost the ability to sign his own name Some critics see these late paintings as flaccid and incontinent channel surfing on canvas Others think they document the de Kooning whom Close saw in the studio an old man still young in his art The paintings themselves have rarely been exhibited But 40 of them beautifully installed at New York City s Museum of Modern Art now make it possible to judge the case for oneself Whatever one s opinion of the paintings success they tell a poignant story of resilience and frailty and of an artist who was passionately unwilling to put away his brushes The story begins at a low point in de Kooning s life In 1979 at age 75 with his short term memory already failing de Kooning quit drinking and entered a period of lethargy and depression It looked as if his most recent works would be his last Those works were large oceanic abstractions that incorporated a kaleidoscopic range of color Like C zanne s last views of Mont Sainte Victoire or Monet s water lilies they had the slightly incoherent grandeur often associated with an altersstil an old age style But when de Kooning pulled himself together and began painting again in earnest in 1981 his paintings looked unlike anything he had made before Untitled I 1981 the first painting in this show is a transitional work a preamble to the new style Using masonry knives and pieces of cardboard instead of brushes de Kooning smears paint across the canvas as if it were Spackle The resulting swaths of color like beach towels rippling on a laundry line create a planar kind of abstraction with large areas of smooth erased whiteness His palette once so full of nuanced colors here shrinks to play school primaries colors that refer to nothing but paint Both changes signal a stripping down an old man s effort to simplify relearn restart In the next painting Pirate also 1981 de Kooning picks up his brushes again But he uses them in an uncharacteristic way The strokes are isolated and tentative gliding over the smooth paint surface like someone ice skating the day after a cast comes off In Untitled III 1981 a scattering of snail shaped blue brush strokes have been cropped and re contoured Their streamlined edges help create a new mood in de Kooning s art one of delicacy radiance and calm For many people such calmness amounted to a betrayal De Kooning was after all the artist for whom the term action painting had been first coined Explosive splashes and drips were supposed to be integral to his art proof of the painting s volcanic authenticity I remember in art school watching otherwise mild mannered students hyperventilate grimace and lunge at their canvases trying desperately to imitate de Kooning s slashing gestures Some critics still subscribe to this view of de Kooning as a kind of Dutch dervish Writing recently in The New Yorker Calvin Tompkins complained that the 1980s paintings lacked the messy viscous slathers of pigment the turbulence and turmoil the sheer velocity of a style that allowed no room for refinement and contemplation To Tompkins these weren t just surface effects but the essential elements of de Kooning s greatness Forty years before similar complaints had been leveled His grotesque sardonic Woman paintings were seen as a betrayal of his earlier abstract phase Today this controversy is a dead issue The abstractions and the Woman paintings hang side by side in museums My bet is that the current objections will prove equally temporary As the unfamiliarity of the early 80s paintings wears off a new amended sense of continuity will emerge Our eyes will focus not on velocity but on volatility on de Kooning s ability to make his images wriggle and buckle never quite settling into the seat belt of a single compositional scheme De Kooning s best paintings from the 40s as well as the early 80s flirt with refinement and turbulence They avoid the ideological options an anarchic expressionism or traditional composition Delicacy doesn t undermine this balancing act A greater sense of control seems on the contrary to highlight it One of my favorites among these paintings Untitled V 1982 is built around a repeated shape that is like a dark letter S But repeated isn t an accurate description here since the shape is never the same twice It bends tilts swells enlarges and shrinks in each new appearance like a vacuum chamber full of snakes In the center of the picture two asymmetrical oxbows form a configuration like a grappling iron anchoring the composition The sense of order here is slight but it s enough to give the picture a momentary precarious unity To my eye this is the essential de Kooning not a slatherer but a destabilizer He creates a kind of equilibrium that is always mobile always about to tilt off to one side and disappear In 1982 and 83 de Kooning undistracted by an outside world he could no longer understand painted at an unprecedented pace completing nearly a picture a week His fat serpentine strokes and lacquer smooth planes twisted around each other arriving at exuberant new combinations that sometimes echoed his old friend Arshile Gorky as well as Henri Matisse and Piet Mondrian painters whose final work was similarly buoyant This brief period may have been the most fertile of his career In 1984 however the paintings changed again marking the start of decline De Kooning continued to paint rapidly but now he seemed to be able to juggle fewer elements Stretching his paint strokes into long narrow ribbons he retreated toward a kind of linear drawing in three colors The paintings became sinuous lattices like the web of a deranged and brilliant spider Within them an endless inventory of shapes and rhythms appears The compositions become ever more undulating and graceful But at this point the difference between supporters and detractors views begins to narrow The pictures precariousness their de Kooningness has unmistakably begun to leak away Gradually the paintings exhibit a restriction in emotional range as well They take on a cartoonish uniform cheeriness The paintings from 1987 are full of charming facility but their decorativeness is repetitive De Kooning himself seems to have left the room Still alive at 93 de Kooning is now neither artist nor channel surfer Immobilized by Alzheimer s disease he sits in his home in Springs having lived beyond what Auden called his last afternoon as himself
