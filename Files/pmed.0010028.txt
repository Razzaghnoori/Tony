 Introduction The immunotherapy of cancer holds promise in harnessing the host immune response to specifically target tumor cells without harming normal tissues Strategies involve adoptive cellular therapy or active immune induction commonly referred to as cancer vaccination Cancer vaccines may consist of whole tumor cells or tumor lysates but identification of tumor associated antigens TAAs over the past decade has made possible the use of specific proteins or peptides as cancer vaccines The anti tumor potential of TAA specific CD8 T cells has been illustrated by the demonstrated capacity of adoptive T cell therapy to reduce tumor size 1 While endogenous anti tumor CD8 T cell responses may already exist in some cancer patients 2 vaccination with TAA derived peptides and in particular heteroclitic peptide analogs increases the frequency of TAA specific T cell responses to detectable levels in many patients 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Heteroclitic peptide analogs are created by substitutions at anchor residues resulting in increased association of peptide with the major histocompatibility complex MHC 10 Consequently heteroclitic peptide analogs are predicted to be more immunogenic than their native counterparts because of more stable binding at the surface of antigen presenting cells APCs Indeed T cells capable of tumor lysis have been isolated from patients vaccinated with heteroclitic peptide 8 11 12 13 However the presence of TAA specific T cells elicited by vaccination often does not correlate with clinical responses 3 14 15 16 17 Various reasons for the paradoxical coexistence of cancer cells and TAA specific T cells within patients have been proposed 18 19 One possibility is that elicited TAA specific T cells are not optimally functional in vivo 2 18 Another possibility is that T cells inefficient in tumor recognition or lysis are induced by vaccination 20 It is becoming recognized that antigen specific T cells may have substantially different requirements for cognate peptide the peptide that is recognizable to a specific T cell clone for efficient target lysis 20 21 22 23 Recognition efficiency RE also known as functional avidity is a measure of the sensitivity of a T cell to different peptide concentrations for stimulation 24 25 26 We hypothesized that high antigen densities on APCs resulting from vaccination with heteroclitic peptide may paradoxically drive T cells of predominantly low RE which are not efficiently activated by the endogenous expression levels of native peptides on tumor cells Consequently such T cells would be ineffective in tumor cell destruction Support for this notion is emerging T cells with low RE are predominantly expanded in vitro with high peptide concentration 22 Moreover in vitro stimulation of T cells from healthy donors with heteroclitic peptides results in expansion of cells with a wide range of RE 23 A similar phenomenon may occur in vivo leading to TAA specific T cells of low RE depending on the nature of antigen stimulation 20 While isolated T cell clones with low RE have indeed been generated from melanoma patients following heteroclitic peptide vaccination the proportion of vaccine elicited T cell responses these cells represent in vivo is not clear If predominantly high RE tumor cytolytic T cells are generated then a small fraction of low RE T cells generated would be of little consequence However if predominantly low RE T cells are generated then this low proportion of high RE T cells may be an important factor in the observed lack of clinical effectiveness of current cancer vaccination strategies To address this important issue we undertook a systematic examination of the complexity of T cell responses induced by heteroclitic peptide vaccination and compared these responses to endogenous anti tumor T cell responses which develop in some patients Typically responses to vaccination are examined following in vitro expansion from patient samples which may alter the composition of cells and consequently not reveal the proportion of cells in vivo having sufficiently high RE to lyse tumor targets Although staining with peptide MHC tetramers provides a direct estimate for the number of TAA specific T cells present in vivo and intensity of tetramer staining has been employed as a parameter for isolation of high RE tumor lytic T cells 27 staining intensity does not correlate well with RE or tumor lytic potential 28 29 and cannot be considered a reliable indicator for the functional status of TAA specific T cells To analyze and compare T cell responses in melanoma patients on a single cell level we generated and examined a large number of cytotoxic T lymphocyte CTL clones derived from post vaccination or endogenous anti tumor T cell responses Each clone was analyzed for T cell receptor TCR variable chain beta VB expression RE and ability to lyse melanoma targets Importantly these clones were generated directly ex vivo through tetramer guided sorting which minimizes the selection bias that could be introduced by prior in vitro expansion Therefore data from these clones could be taken to estimate the complexity of the responses in vivo Methods Patients and Samples All patients had resected stage III or IV melanoma as determined by the 1988 modified American Joint Commission on Cancer staging system They were

each point A linear regression using least squares of percent specific lysis on recognition efficiency is shown in Figure 5A and 5B Results T Cell Responses to TAAs in Patients with Melanoma To address the complexity of T cell responses against melanoma in vivo patients with vaccine induced or endogenous TAA specific responses were selected In recent cancer vaccine trials 3 4 5 many melanoma patients who received heteroclitic peptide vaccines gp100 209 217 210M IMDQVPSFV G209 2M and MART 26 35 27L ELAGIGILTV M26 had measurable CD8 peptide specific T cell responses in PBMCs detected by peptide MHC tetramer staining In addition TAA specific T cell responses could be detected in some patients without vaccination suggesting the existence of an endogenous anti tumor T cell response in these patients For the current study we selected samples from six melanoma patients from these trials four with vaccine elicited responses patients 422 476 517 and 520 and two with endogenous T cell responses patients 132 and 461 for detailed analyses of TCR VB usage RE for the target peptide and tumor cytotoxicity The samples from these six patient had peptide specific T cell populations detectable with G209 2M tetramers patients 422 476 and 132 or M26 tetramers patients 517 520 and 461 ranging from 0 1 to 2 5 of total CD8 T cells Figure 1A Vaccine Elicited T Cells Are Functional Directly Ex Vivo but of Variable Tumor Reactivity Patient 422 had the largest detectable TAA specific CD8 T cell response 2 5 G209 2M tetramer positive and thus sufficient numbers for examination of lytic function immediately following isolation To test whether peptide vaccine induced T cell responses were functionally active directly ex vivo T cells isolated by G209 2M tetramer guided cell sorting from patient 422 were tested for lysis of peptide pulsed and melanoma target cells in microcytotoxic assays Figure 1B The directly isolated tetramer positive T cells from this patient specifically lysed T2 cells pulsed with high concentrations 1 g ml of G209 2M and native G209n peptides but not with T2 cells pulsed with a cytomegalovirus derived HLA A 0201 restricted peptide NLVPMVATV or melanoma targets This suggests that while a significant portion of the vaccine elicited T cells from patient 422 may be functional in vivo they did not have significant tumor lysis activity To assess the functional status of the smaller TAA specific CD8 T cell responses in the other five patients which were too small for direct cytotoxicity assays after sorting we utilized a novel FACS assay for degranulation based on CD107 mobilization 24 All six TAA specific populations exhibited robust functional responses ex vivo as measured by percentage of G2090 2M and M26 tetramer positive cells that mobilized CD107 and or downregulated the CD3 complex upon incubation with T2 cells pulsed with cognate peptides Table 1 86 99 6 In response to melanoma targets mel526 and Malme 3M which both express gp100 and MART 1 and are HLA A 0201 positive the two endogenous TAA specific responses samples from patients 132 and 461 also exhibited robust functional responses directly ex vivo Table 1 36 8 87 and these responses were specific as they had little response to A375 a HLA A 0201 positive melanoma cell that does not express gp100 or MART 1 and served as a negative control for antigen specific killing Table 1 2 7 and 3 In contrast the vaccine elicited responses exhibited much lower reactivity to mel526 and Malme 3M Table 1 23 8 32 5 These data demonstrate that all six TAA specific CD8 T cell responses were functional ex vivo but there were significant differences in reactivity to melanoma targets between endogenous and vaccine elicited responses To substantiate the generality of these findings we analyzed four additional patients with vaccine elicited responses One subject responded to G209 2M only patient 722 one to M26 only patient 713 and two to both G209 2M and M26 patients 721 and 735 Similar to the first four vaccine elicited patients these four additional patients six TAA specific responses in total exhibited variable reactivity to melanoma targets ranging from 13 to 49 6 Table 1 Vaccine Elicited T Cells Have Varied Capacity to Lyse Melanoma Targets To confirm and further investigate the differences in tumor reactivity between endogenous and vaccine elicited responses we reasoned that analysis of a set of clonal CTL lines that represented the tetramer positive population would provide an accurate estimate of the complexity of the TAA specific T cell response in each patient A large number of clonal CTL lines more than 200 were generated by FACS of individual G209 2M and M26 tetramer positive cells directly from PBMC samples Table 2 Up to 85 of sorted cells expanded in various sorts data not shown Randomly selected expanding clones and the tetramer positive population from which they were derived were examined for TCR VB expression using TCR VB specific monoclonal Abs and VB specific primers in PCR Diverse TAA specific T cell responses were found in the four vaccinated patients with multiple T cells expressing different TCR VB while the two endogenous responses were less diverse All but one clone derived from patient 132 expressed VB17 while two dominating T cell populations in patient 476 expressed VB14 and VB17 Table 2 The clonality of the dominant populations in these patients was evaluated by PCR fragment length analysis Table 3 Identical length fragments were demonstrated in the four selected clones from 476 BV14 and 476 BV17 populations Identical length fragments were also demonstrated in all BV17 clones from patient 132 Furthermore analysis of sorted tetramer positive cells from patient 476 demonstrated single fragment sizes for BV14 and BV17 which were identical to the fragment sizes generated from the selected clones arguing for clonality of these dominant populations Table 3 Peptide specificity and CD8 expression of each clone was confirmed by staining with G209 2M and M26 tetramers and anti CD8 monoclonal Ab data not shown To obtain an accurate reflection of the total T cell population detected with tetramer in each patient we decided to rigorously examine at least one representative clone for each subpopulation expressing a different TCR VB Table 4 Multiple clones were analyzed to determine dominating populations From patients 132 517 and 461 for which fewer clones were generated all clones were included in the analyses Table 4 To determine the effectiveness of tumor lysis by the different TAA specific T cell clones that were propagated clones were analyzed for their ability to lyse melanoma cell lines mel526 and Malme 3M A375 cells served as a control for antigen specific killing In addition each CTL clone was examined for antigen specific lysis of T2 cells pulsed with high levels 1 g ml of G209 2M or M26 peptides Efficient lysis in these experiments was defined as 40 or greater specific release of radiolabel from the target cells 10 or less specific release was categorized as low or no lysis and 10 to 40 was termed intermediate lysis All but two of the CTL clones elicited from endogenous anti tumor responses from patients 132 and 461 exhibited efficient lysis of both the mel526 and Malme 3M melanoma cell lines Figure 2 In contrast only a few clones from the vaccine elicited responses from patients 422 476 520 and 517 efficiently lysed melanoma cells The majority of clones examined from these vaccine elicited responses either failed to lyse melanoma targets altogether or lysed them with intermediate efficiency Figure 2 This lack of efficiency in melanoma cell lysis was not due to cellular dysfunction since each clone efficiently lysed T2 cells pulsed with high levels of relevant but not irrelevant peptide Figure 2 Overall the majority of clones derived from endogenous anti tumor responses patients 132 and 461 lysed both mel526 and Malme 3M melanoma target cells more efficiently than clones from vaccine elicited responses patients 422 476 520 and 517 Figure 3 These findings suggest that TAA specific T cells elicited by heteroclitic peptide vaccination have different tumor cytolytic potentials from those which develop endogenously to cancer RE for Native and Heteroclitic Peptides of T Cells from Endogenous or Vaccine Elicited Responses We hypothesized that CTL clones that did not efficiently lyse melanoma targets may be incapable of recognizing the relatively low surface densities of native peptide present on tumor cells CTL clones selected for analysis of tumor lysis were also assessed for RE for the native and heteroclitic peptides via a ten log range of dilutions This is illustrated with clones 132 1 and 476 105 Figure 4A There were considerable differences in killing of peptide pulsed T2 cells by these two clones The differences in RE for G209n native peptide displayed by the two clones highlighted in Figure 3A correlated with their ability to lyse melanoma cells the high RE clone 132 1 efficiently lysed melanoma targets whereas the low RE clone 476 105 did not Figure 4B In contrast to the differences in RE for G209n peptide similar assays revealed little difference in RE of the two clones for G209 2M heteroclitic peptide Figure 4C suggesting that these clones recognize the native and heteroclitic peptides differently and that RE for the native but not heteroclitic peptide correlates with tumor lytic potential Similar RE assays were performed for the remaining clones from each patient selected for analysis In order to compare REs of various CTL lines each clone was assigned an RE score expressed as the negative log 10 value of the peptide concentration required for 40 specific lysis at an E T ratio of 10 1 For clones 132 1 and 476 105 these scores were 11 1 and 8 3 for assays with G209n peptide Figure 4A and 11 2 and 11 2 for assays with G209 2M heteroclitic peptide Figure 4C respectively We compiled the data on clones from all patients which showed a correlation between tumor lytic potential and RE for native peptide Figure 5A and 5B Overall clones generated from endogenous anti tumor responses had higher RE for the native peptide than clones generated from post vaccine responses Figure 5C and 5D We estimated the composite RE of the overall TAA specific response composed of a heterogeneous population of T cells in vivo by summing the RE of each clone multiplied by its representation in the original mixture the representation was estimated based on the proportion of TAA specific cells expressing the same VB as the clone These composite RE values are represented in Figure 5 as horizontal bars for each response Clearly the endogenous responses patients 461 and 132 had a higher overall and more homogeneous RE for the native peptide than the vaccine elicited responses patients 422 476 517 and 520 Figure 5C and 5D Importantly the vaccine elicited clones also exhibited wide variations in RE even for the heteroclitic peptide compared to the endogenous responses Figure 5E and 5F This suggests that the variation in RE for native peptides and hence ability to lyse tumor cells for vaccine elicited responses is not merely a reflection of differential recognition of native and heteroclitic peptides by many clones Rather variations in RE may be a function of the manner in which these cells were elicited in vivo via vaccination Discussion To achieve maximal clinical responses the majority of T cells elicited by vaccination in cancer patients should be capable of responding to tumor targets We have undertaken the most detailed analysis to date on a single cell level of T cell responses elicited by cancer vaccination and have compared these with endogenous anti tumor responses To evaluate the full spectrum of T cells elicited in each patient by vaccination we utilized tetramers made with the vaccine peptides heteroclitic M26 and G209 2M to isolate such cells CTL clones were selected directly from patient PBMC samples without enrichment in culture to closely reflect the composition of the antigen specific T cell response in vivo at the time of isolation Our data revealed that T cell populations induced by vaccination were significantly different from endogenous responses while some CTLs elicited by vaccination could kill melanoma targets most were inefficient in tumor cell lysis In contrast nearly all clones from endogenous responses were efficient at melanoma cell lysis This difference was related to RE for the native peptide Clones that did not lyse tumor cells required up to 10 3 fold higher concentration of peptide for similar levels of lysis of targets compared to T cell clones that were tumor lytic Side by side comparison of endogenous responses and vaccine induced responses suggests that low RE TAA specific T cell responses may be preferentially driven by heteroclitic peptide vaccination Thus high doses of peptide and or the higher levels of expression of heteroclitic peptide on APCs may induce and actively propagate predominantly T cells with RE too low for recognition of physiological levels of the native peptide present on tumor targets These data suggest an inverse relationship between antigen density and the RE of T cells elicited This would be an important consideration in design of future vaccine strategies Differential recognition of native and heteroclitic peptides by many T cells may also account for the induction of non tumor lytic clones by heteroclitic peptide vaccines which has been suggested previously 23 32 However our data suggest that epitope density may be the dominant driving factor for RE in vivo In all of the vaccine elicited T cell responses many of the T cells generated were either of low or intermediate RE not only for the native peptide but also for the heteroclitic peptide and exhibited no or intermediate lysis of tumor targets In contrast nearly all of the clones generated from the endogenous responses were of high RE This suggests that the high dosage of peptides administered in vaccinations and the increased binding capacity of heteroclitic peptides to MHC molecules the very quality that provides them with increased immunogenicity drive the induction of many T cells with low RE for both heteroclitic and native peptides Another implication of this study is that the number of cells measured by current methods including ELISPOT or staining with MHC tetramers may not correlate directly with the RE or tumor reactivity of T cell responses to vaccination For example of the nine clones analyzed from patient 517 none were efficient in tumor cell lysis yet these cells were detectable by MHC tetramer staining T cells with low RE for native TAA do not efficiently lyse tumor and therefore are unlikely to have an impact on clinical outcome Furthermore it may be possible that low RE TAA specific T cells may interfere with elicitation of high RE T cells either by direct competition for antigen on APC surface 33 34 or down modulation of peptide MHC complexes Our data support the notion that not only quantity but quality of the T cell response elicited by vaccination may be important for clinical efficacy There are a number of strategies to increase the magnitude of T cell responses to peptide vaccines These include using various adjuvants such as incomplete Freund s adjuvant and immunomodulatory agents such as IL 12 4 GM CSF 5 anti CTLA 4 Abs 35 or heat shock proteins 36 Thus far none of these approaches have produced improved clinical outcomes Our data suggest that in addition to driving higher numbers of vaccine elicited T cells strategies to modulate the relative RE of T cell responses are also needed While the selective activation of high versus low RE T cells is relatively easy to manipulate in vitro via stimulation with limiting amounts of peptides this may be more difficult to control in vivo It is important to bear in mind that signals needed to drive a de novo na ve T cell response may be different from those required to drive further expansion of an activated T cell population 37 Thus a complete vaccination strategy may involve an initial induction phase followed by progressive shaping of the response to higher RE Although heteroclitic peptide vaccination may drive T cells of mixed high and low RE such a strong stimulus may be needed to induce an initial de novo T cell response Studies in mice suggest that once activated effector CD8 T cells may have an increase in RE of up to 70 fold compared to na ve cells 38 39 40 Thus na ve TAA specific T cells with inadequate RE to become activated by low densities of native peptides present on tumor cells may become efficient in tumor lysis upon vaccination with heteroclitic peptide This notion has support from studies in tolerized mice vaccination with a heteroclitic peptide analog recruited T cells which were responsive to secondary stimulation with native peptide 41 42 Therefore optimized use of heteroclitic peptide to induce an initial peptide specific T cell response followed by selective expansion of the highest RE tumor lytic T cells may be needed for an effective strategy with clear clinical application In summary we have demonstrated that vaccination with heteroclitic peptide at high concentrations may drive T cell responses of variable tumor cytolytic potential in cancer patients and that the ability to lyse tumor cells correlates with the T cell s RE for native peptides This represents an important but not sole factor in explaining the lack of correlation between immunological and clinical responses after vaccination for cancer Importantly the situation is different in endogenous responses in which cells are predominantly of high RE This suggests that the manner in which T cells are elicited in vivo are different in these two settings and may underlie their differences in biology
