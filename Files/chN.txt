Nacimiento Nativity SceneFrom the Spanish word nacer nacimiento is the name for a Christmas nativity scene In the Southwest the creation of nacimientos has been a tradition since the seventeenth century A nacimiento may resemble a religious altar in that it is an assemblage of many articles and objects all depicting the recent birth of Jesus Christ in the manger but a nacimiento can also include other Christmasrelated images biblical scenes and possibly artifacts relating to the life experiences of the creator The set of the nacimiento can vary in size from a small table to half a room or to the whole front yard of a home Outdoor nacimientos will have lifesize figures of Mary and Joseph and various other biblical characters and animals This custom is not particular to the Chicano community and nativity scenes can be found throughout the country during the Christmas season It is thought that Saint Francis of Assisi is the saint responsible for much of the veneration of the infant Jesus and the custom of creating nativity scenes or monuments to the birth of Christ has been going on for hundreds of yearsIn private homes nacimientos are usually set up for the first night of Las Posadas which starts on December  and continues until December  A nacimiento is left in place until El Da de los Reyes Epiphany on January  when the three kings arrive to visit the Christ childSee also Las PosadasReferences Griffith  Heisley and MacGregorVillarreal  Kitchener  Sommers Naranja Dulce Sweet OrangeA very popular old childrens game and song frequently recited in novels and

have settled and lived it is New Mexicos culture and folklore that has been historically studied the most Aurelio M Espinosa was the first Hispano a person of Spanish heritage born in New Mexico to conduct research into the culture and language of New Mexicans His most important work was published during the early part of the nineteenth century  with a series of publications in the Journal of American Folklore He collected folktales folk songs proverbs superstitions riddles childrens games and much more Students who were trained by Espinosa and who later continued folkloric work in New Mexico were Arthur Campa Juan B Rael and Espinosas son Jose Manuel Espinosa who published Spanish Folktales from New Mexico in  Rael published Cuentos Espaoles de Colorado y Nuevo Mejico in  which is considered by Amrico Paredes to be one of the best collections of Mexican folk narrative Campas work includes collections of folk poetry riddles folk songs and folk drama from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries published mostly in the s and sJohn Donald Robb  collected folk songs throughout New Mexico in the s and s using wire recorders He came to the University of New Mexico as chair of the music department in  He was a composer and educator but always had an interest in folk music The John Donald Robb Archive of Southwestern Music is located at the universitys library His two books on New Mexico are Hispanic Folk Songs of New Mexico  and Hispanic Folk Music of New Mexico and the Southwest A Self Portrait of a People Hispanic women have always been involved in creative and artistic work in New Mexico even up until contemporary times Although there have been many publications about the santeros saint makers woodcarvers tinsmiths and other male artists very little has been written about the work accomplished by women Women have created religious folk art such as santos saints retablos religious paintings straw appliqu crosses and tinwork Women wove blankets and embroidered colchas blankets Whitewashing and plastering of homes have always been womens work Those who do it are called enjarradoras and today they continue this work also making adobe hornos ovens and fireplaces for the International Museum of Folk Art located in Santa Fe Marianne Stoller writes of the work of New Mexican women artists and why they have been left out of historySeveral New Mexican women who descended from the early Spanish settlers of the region wrote personal life histories that incorporated the traditional way of life of the Hispano community of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Fabiola Cabeza de Baca Nina OteroWarren and Cleofas Jaramillo each produced several books that present the folklore rituals and customs of the New Mexicans Rebolledo discusses how these women used their writings as narrative strategies of resistance because they saw their culture and way of life slowly eroding away and being assimilated by a dominant and foreign culture Because they all came from upperclass families they were educated in Spanish traditions and language and consequently ignored the mestizo mixedrace and indigenous aspects of the culture often depicting their past in romantic pastoral terms Nevertheless they all wrote of the loss of land and loss of culture and sought to preserve the folklore customs and stories of their grandparents close friends and those who worked for themThe Penitentes the ancient religious brotherhood have attracted much research and been scrutinized by many writers and journalists De Cordova Henderson Sprott and Weigle have conducted the most perceptive and sensitive writing on the Penitentes The popular arts of colonial New Mexico particularly the santos and santeros have received a lot of attention by such researchers as E Boyd Marta Weigle and William WrothIn recent years Chicano writers from New Mexico have collected folklore from their ancestors and friends Nasario Garcia has published several collections depicting the way of life of the elders of the Rio Puerco Valley and Rudolfo Anaya has written several childrens books that bring forth the folklore of the region Because of its long history New Mexico will always be a bountiful reservoir for the serious folkloristSee also Adobe Hispano Culture Los PenitentesReferences De Cordova  Espinosa AM Jr  Henderson  Rebolledo   Sprott  Stoller  Weigle  Weigle and White Nichos NichesA nicho is a nook or niche built into a wall that is similar to a shelf inside of a home It can be as small as six inches or as high as one foot or even three feet Anything can be placed in a nicho from books to knickknacks but the usual purpose is to house a holy picture or statue of a saint Consequently in some Chicano homes the word carries almost the same meaning as altar or shrine A nicho decorated with votive candles and saints becomes the site for daily devotional prayers Nichos are also constructed as part of yard shrines to house a favorite saint or La Virgen de Guadalupe or another Madonna Yard shrines that incorporate a nicho are set up as a place of worship in the yard to commemorate a deceased relative or as a fulfillment of a vow In some parts of the Southwest these outdoor shrines are also called grutas grottos and the two words are often used interchangeably A cemetery shrine may also incorporate a nicho or a gruta Since a gruta is primarily outdoors it can be constructed as a yard or cemetery shrine Nichos that are found in front yards may be constructed of cement or wood and may appear as a small house chapelshaped or as a small cave A wroughtiron door may be installed for privacy or to prevent vandalism Yard nichos can vary in size from one foot to six or eight feet high Invariably they are decorated with plastic flowers and plants and are often painted in pastel colorsSee also Altars Grutas Yard ShrinesReferences Cash  Griffith  Ramos  Vidaurri  West Nuns Habit See Hbito
