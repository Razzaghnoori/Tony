 Introduction Cancer evolves from the accumulation of mutations and the deregulation of two classes of genes oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes The large majority of breast cancers arise in epithelia of the breast and they are thought to evolve from hyperplasia with atypia to carcinoma in situ invasive carcinoma and finally metastatic disease The molecular mechanisms leading to breast malignancies are unclear but many genetic abnormalities and epigenetic factors have been implicated including changes affecting known tumor suppressor genes p53 BRCA1 BRCA2 PTEN MMAC1 TEP1 and proto oncogenes neu ErbB2 HER2 ErbB1 EGFR PRAD 1 cyclin D1 Mdm2 and c myc reviewed in ref 1 The gene product of PTEN phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 is a lipid phosphatase that reverses the activities of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase PI3K by dephosphorylating the D3 position of its lipid products phosphatidylinositol 3 4 bis phosphate PtdIns 3 4 P2 phosphatidylinositol 3 5 bis phosphate PtdIns 3 5 P2 and 3 4 5 tri phosphate PtdIns 3 4 5 P3 2 3 the elevated levels of which are linked to the transforming ability of PI3K reviewed in ref 4 PtdIns 3 4 P2 and PtdIns 3 4 5 P3 recruit AKT also known as protein kinase B PKB to the membrane through the N terminal pleckstrin homology PH domain of AKT reviewed in ref 5 Membrane localization renders AKT permissive to phosphorylation by phosphatidyl inositol dependent kinases PDK1 and PDK2 at Thr308 within the activation loop and at Ser473 near the carboxyl terminus Phosphorylation activates the kinase domain of AKT which in turn phosphorylates target proteins on serine and threonine residues Substrates of AKT include glycogen synthase kinase 3 GSK3 p70 S6 kinase BAD Caspase 9 4E BP1 I B kinase and members of the Forkhead transcription family reviewed in ref 6 7 Constitutive membrane localization of AKT leads to its deregulated activation and can induce oncogenic transformation 8 9 All three human members of the AKT family are over produced in various human cancers AKT1 is over expressed in gastric adenocarcinomas and breast cancer cell lines AKT2 is amplified and over expressed in pancreatic ovarian and breast cancers and AKT3 is upregulated in estrogen receptor deficient breast cancer and in androgen independent prostate cell lines reviewed in ref 6 Consistent with the role of PTEN as a lipid phosphatase PTEN deficient human and mouse cells have elevated levels of intracellular PtdIns 3 4 5 P3 10 11 and demonstrate constitutive activation of AKT in the absence of growth factors 12 13 14 The relationship between components of this pathway is also conserved in flies and worms A germline mutation in PTEN is associated with multi neoplastic autosomally dominant syndromes in humans such as Cowden disease and Bannayan Zonana syndrome also known as Bannayan Riley Ruvalcaba syndrome and 20 50 of affected females in these families develop breast cancer 15 16 17 The PTEN gene is also frequently deleted or mutated in a variety of sporadic human malignancies such as glioblastoma and carcinomas of the prostate endometrium and breast Although somatic mutations in the gene have been detected in only about 1 of breast cancers loss of heterozygosity LOH at the PTEN locus 10q23 is frequently found approximately 40 and 33 of breast tumors have no detectable or reduced levels of the protein product 18 19 20 21 22 Three independent mouse lines carrying inactivating Pten mutations have been made 23 24 25 All mice homozygous for these Pten mutations die during early embryogenesis By 6 months of age heterozygous mice develop tumors of the lymphoid system colon uterus and adrenal medulla with very high penetrance and tumors of the prostate and thyroid with lower penetrance While benign mammary lesions usually fibroadenomas are found in female mice after 7 months of age few animals develop ductal carcinomas KP and RP unpublished 26 which account for over 85 of human breast cancers In an effort to develop a model for studying the effects of Pten inactivation in mammary oncogenesis we have introduced an additional genetic alteration an MMTV Wnt 1 transgene by breeding Pten heterozygotes 25 with MMTV Wnt 1 transgenic TG mice 27 Female mice harboring the Wnt 1 transgene develop extensive mammary hyperplasia early in life and 50 of them develop mammary ductal carcinomas by 6 months of age 27 This transgene has been shown to collaborate with Fgf 3 and inactivation of p53 to accelerate the appearance of mammary tumors 28 30 After a mutant allele of Pten was crossed into Wnt 1 TG mice we found that ductal carcinomas appeared earlier than either alteration alone and that LOH at the Pten locus occurred in the majority of these tumors suggesting a selective growth advantage in cells that lack Pten functions Results Wnt 1 TG mice have been used to assess the functions of a number of genetic lesions in breast carcinogenesis because tumors appear with predictable kinetics The median age at which tumors are detected is 5 6 months in MMTV Wnt 1 TG females 27 28 30 31 After one mutated allele of Pten was bred into this transgenic line tumors appeared significantly earlier than in sibling females harboring only a MMTV Wnt 1 transgene P 0 001 Fig 1A Fifty percent of Pten Wnt 1 TG female mice formed tumors by 3 5 months 2 5 months earlier than Wnt 1 TG mice Fig 1A While it took one year for the entire cohort 15 of Wnt 1 TG females with a wild type Pten background to develop tumors all Wnt 1 TG Pten females showed tumors by 5 months of age Five each of Pten mice without a Wnt 1 transgene were monitored for 7 months and 10 5 months but none developed any palpable mammary lesions These observations differ from a recent report that one of the other two Pten lines develops fibroadenomas and adenocarcinomas in the mammary tissue after 7 months of age 26 The lack of a mammary phenotype in our studies could be due to differences in the targeting constructs the genetic backgrounds or even environmental agents By one year of age approximately 15 of Wnt 1 TG males have been reported to develop mammary tumors 27 28 31 In our cross one of the four tumors from Wnt 1 TG males in an otherwise wild type background was a mammary carcinoma the other three tumors were salivary in origin with a similar histopathology to the mammary lesion The appearance of tumors was greatly accelerated in the Pten heterozygous background Fig 1B Fifty percent of males developed tumors by 5 5 months of age and all developed tumors within 10 months As in the case of Wnt 1 TG male mice without Pten mutations the majority of tumors 14 22 arose in the salivary tissue only a small number of tumors 2 22 were mammary in origin and interestingly some 6 22 were bilateral or unilateral muzzle tumors of epithelial origin similar histopathologically to lesions found in mammary and salivary tissues To determine if the wild type allele of Pten was inactivated in tumors arising in a Pten background 11 tumors from Wnt 1 TG Pten mice were examined for LOH by Southern hybridization Seven tumors had lost the wild type Pten allele see Fig 2for an example of the analysis This result suggests that in tumorigenesis cells that lack a functional allele of Pten have a significant proliferative advantage over the cells that retain the normal copy of Pten Histological examination showed that tumors from Wnt 1 TG mice regardless of Pten status were adenocarcinomas with cribriform cystic and focal papillary growth patterns However 3 of the 6 tumors that were Wnt 1 TG Pten with LOH appeared to have a higher nuclear grade more cellular stroma and a more infiltrative pattern compared to the tumors without a Pten defect Fig 3 suggesting a more aggressive phenotype In human cancer a tumor suppressor gene can be inactivated by mutations chromosomal loss promoter silencing and other means To determine if the Pten protein was produced in Wnt 1 TG Pten tumors that did not undergo LOH sections were analyzed using an immunohistochemical assay with a polyclonal rabbit antibody Abundant amounts of Pten were detected in mammary ducts from wild type mice Pten was detected at reduced levels in both hyperplastic ducts and mammary tumors that did not have LOH at the Pten allele Fig 4 suggesting that Pten was indeed made from the second allele Similar low levels of Pten were also detected in mammary ductal epithelial cells in Pten heterozygous mice that did not have a Wnt 1 transgene suggesting that the Wnt 1 transgene does not influence Pten expression As expected Pten was not detected in tumors that had undergone LOH at the Pten locus Fig 4E Inactivation of Pten promotes membrane recruitment of AKT and its subsequent activation by phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308 10 11 13 All three human isoforms of AKT have been found to be deregulated in human breast cancer cells 32 33 34 To determine if activated AKT was increased in tumors that had a Pten defect these sections were stained using an antibody that specifically detects AKT1 phosphorylated at Ser 473 and AKT2 and AKT3 phosphorylated at equivalent sites Tumors that were Wnt 1 TG Pten with LOH displayed staining of phosphorylated AKT Fig 5A Surprisingly the staining was patchy suggesting additional factors may be required for AKT activation As expected phosphorylated AKT was undetectable in hyperplastic ducts in tumors from Wnt 1 TG Pten mice and tumors from Wnt 1 TG Pten mice that retained the wild type allele Fig 5B C Several apoptotic pathways may be inhibited upon activation of AKT promoting maintenance and survival of tumor cells Cellular proliferation may also be enhanced by activated AKT which inhibits p27 and GSK 3 leading to stabilization of cyclin D1 35 However tumors from Wnt 1 TG Pten mice have low apoptotic rates 40 16 per digital camera field using a 20x objective and high proliferation rates 53 11 Neither apoptotic nor proliferation rates were affected by the status of Pten when measured by the TUNEL terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase mediated UTP end labeling assay which labels the ends of fragmented DNA present in apoptotic cells and immunohistochemical staining for Ki67 a cell proliferation marker data not shown Most Wnt 1 TG mice 38 49 developed only one palpable tumor regardless of Pten status Fifty three of 55 single sections from Pten glands that were free of a palpable mass did not show any lesions more advanced than ductal hyperplasia However at the time of sacrifice the majority 50 56 of glands from Wnt 1 TG Pten mice had intra ductal squamous lesions of various sizes Fig 3D These squamous lesions were usually multi focal and located both at the periphery of the adenocarcinomas and in other mammary glands free of adenocarcinomas Since Pten mutations are usually found in advanced tumors and the protein has been suggested to inhibit cell spreading migration and invasion 36 37 it is possible that the tumors from Wnt 1 TG Pten mice may have a higher potential to metastasize than those from mice carrying a Wnt 1 transgene in a wild type Pten background Wnt 1 TG mice occasionally show lymphoid or pulmonary metastasis 27 and serial sectioning of lung tissues from the animals reported here revealed microsocopic metastatic foci in two of five lungs from Wnt 1 TG mice bearing primary tumors 1 5 2 0 cm in size However Wnt 1 TG mice and the Wnt 1 TG Pten mice harbored metastatic foci at similar frequencies 5 10 Statistical evaluation was not performed because the sample sizes were too small Discussion Mouse models are valuable research tools for the study of the molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis and for the testing and screening of cancer therapeutic agents targeted to specific oncogenic lesions In order to produce such a model for studying the effects of Pten mutations in breast cancer we have crossed Wnt 1 TG mice to mice heterozygous for Pten Mice transgenic for MMTV Wnt 1 and heterozygous for Pten developed mammary adenocarcinomas much earlier than mice carrying either lesion alone The majority of tumors in Wnt 1 TG Pten mice had lost the wild type allele of Pten suggesting that the complete inactivation of Pten function provides an additional growth advantage to these tumors LOH at the Pten locus has recently been reported in mammary tumors arising in Pten heterozygous mice 26 but only 4 of the mice developed tumors before the age of 30 weeks and in our cross none of the Pten mice without the Wnt 1 transgene had a palpable mammary tumor before the age of 30 weeks LOH at the Pten locus has also been reported in adrenal and lymphatic tumors but not in uterine tumors and prostate lesions in Pten mice KP RP submitted 38 Activated AKT was more abundant in tumors that were Wnt 1 TG Pten with LOH as has been shown for uterine tumors in Pten heterozygous mice KP RP submitted The presence of areas unstained with antibody specific for phosphorylated AKT suggests that additional factors other than Pten may influence the activation of AKT Neither apoptosis nor proliferation as determined by the TUNEL assay and KI67 staining was significantly different between tumors heterozygous for Pten with or without LOH and those without a Pten defect This result may seem paradoxical since increased phosphorylated AKT due to inactivation of Pten suppresses apoptosis and promotes proliferation However tumors in Wnt 1 TG mice in a wild type Pten background already have highly suppressed apoptosis and accelerated proliferation rates and any incremental changes if present may be difficult to detect with our current assays Nonetheless a seemingly minor difference in either apoptosis or proliferation could have a dramatic impact on tumor growth over time Accelerated appearance of mammary adenocarcinomas in the presence of a Pten mutation suggests a synergy between Pten inactivation and the Wnt 1 transgene The apparent cooperation of these two genetic factors is further strengthened by our finding that the majority of tumors arising in a Pten background have lost the wild type allele To date heterozygous inactivation of any of the other tumor suppressor genes implicated in breast cancer including P53 Brca1 Brca2 and Rb has failed to cooperate with Wnt 1 in promoting the appearance of mammary tumors reviewed in ref 39 Therefore it is possible that the signal pathway controlled by Pten is one of the preferred partners of the Wnt 1 pathway in cancer progression although it remains possible that LOH at the Pten locus is more likely to occur than for the other alleles crossed into Wnt 1 TG mice Even though Wnt 1 has not been directly implicated in human cancers many components of the Wnt signaling pathway such as catenin APC c myc and cyclin D 1 are involved in human tumors including breast cancer reviewed in ref 40 One of the goals of mouse modeling efforts is to provide an opportunity for pre clinical testing of generalized or mechanism specific therapeutics in a defined genetic setting Many human breast tumors have reduced levels of PTEN hence inhibitors of the cell signaling pathways affected by PTEN could be tested in the model we have developed One such candidate is the rapamycin analog CCI779 which has been suggested to inhibit the AKT signaling pathway probably through inhibition of mTOR target of rapamycin a potential target of AKT reviewed in ref 41 CCI779 has been shown to have inhibitory effects on the growth of Pten deficient tumors in the uterus and prostate in mice KP RP submitted M Neshat C Sawyers submitted Since tumors arise rapidly after a copy of Pten is inactivated and with predictable kinetics this model may be useful for testing the efficacy of these therapies Results presented here and published earlier 15 16 17 18 26 have clearly demonstrated the significant impact of Pten on mammary oncogenesis Future testing will examine the tumorigenic effects caused by other kinds of genetic damage in the signaling pathways affected by Pten The TVA directed gene delivery system reviewed in ref 42 can be used to introduce viral vectors carrying genes encoding an activated form of PI3K AKT or candidate substrates for AKT into the mammary tissue of Wnt 1 TG mice This would allow the testing of therapeutic interventions directed to specific steps of the signaling pathway regulated by Pten Materials and methods Mice MMTV Wnt 1 TG mice 27 and those that carry a mutant allele of Pten 25 have been described Male Wnt 1 TG mice a mixture of FVB SJL and C57BL 6 were crossed with Pten heterozygous females a mixture of C57BL 6 and 129SvJ to generate all three genotypes used in this paper Wnt 1 TG Pten Wnt 1 TG Pten and Pten Genotyping for the Wnt 1 transgene was done using PCR as described 27 PCR using primers from the neo cassette was performed to detect the Pten knockout allele Mice were monitored weekly for tumor formation by visual inspection and or palpation most tumors were found when they were approximately 0 5 cm Most of tumors were harvested for further analysis when they were 1 5 cm in diameter Tissues were fixed in 10 buffered formalin and paraffin embedded For histological survey one H E section per block was analyzed Immunohistochemical staining and TUNEL assay Formalin fixed and paraffin embedded sections were deparaffined and rehydrated in several changes of xylene ethanol and water Antigen unmasking was achieved by boiling the slides for 15 minutes in citrate buffer pH 6 0 or 1 mM EDTA Endogenous peroxidase activity was inactivated by a 5 minute incubation in 3 hydrogen peroxide when needed Immunohistochemical stainings were performed using Vector ABC kits Vector Laboratories following the manufacturer s recommendations and as described 25 Rabbit antibodies against Pten Ki67 and AKT phosphorylated at Ser 473 were from Neomarkers Dako and New England BioLabs respectively The TUNEL assay was performed as described 25 Southern hybridization DNAs extracted from tissues and tumors were digested with Pst I followed by electrophoresis and blotted to Nylon membrane Hybridization was done in ExpressHyb solution Clontech at 60 C using a 32P dCTP labeled probe that was synthesized from a 0 9 Kb template located in intron 5 of Pten 25 using the RTS RadPrime DNA labeling system Life Technologies The probe was incubated with Cot 1 DNA Life Technologies at 70 C for 10 minutes before addition to the hybridization solution
