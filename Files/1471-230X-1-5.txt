 Background Aims MAdCAM 1 is a 60 kD endothelial cell adhesion molecule expressed on the surface of high endothelial venules in the gut and in Peyers patches MAdCAM 1 is expressed basally in these tissues and is dramatically increased in inflammatory bowel disease IBD In IBD especially Crohn s disease MAdCAM 1 acts as the main ligand for a4b7 expressing lymphocytes and recruits these lymphocytes into the intestine where they initiate and sustain chronic inflammation Several animal models and human studies support an absolute requirement for both MAdCAM 1 and a4b7 in the production of immune models of colitis MAdCAM 1 is expressed on the surface of lymphoid endothelial cells in response to several cytokines including TNF and IL lb however the signal transduction pathways involved in MAdCAM 1 are still not well understood However since MAdCAM 1 is induced by Th1 cytokines like TNF and IL 1b it is likely that its induction is mechanistically similar to that of adhesion molecules like ICAM 1 and VCAM 1 These adhesion molecules are also induced by Th1 cytokines and require activation of the NF kB PARP The activation of these transcription factors also requires the formation of intracellular oxidants since mobilization of these adhesion molecules in response to cytokines can be prevented by antioxidants like PDTC or NAC Physiologically the expression of these cell adhesion molecules also appears to be limited by the formation of NO through either constituitive or inducible forms of nitric oxide synthase eNOS iNOS It has been suggested that NO could inhibit the transcription translation of adhesion molecules through either scavenging of signal oxidants produced in response to cytokines or through covalent modification of polypeptides in the signaling pathway like IkB Here we examine the induction of MAdCAM 1 by TNF and evaluated whether endogenous nitric oxide from eNOS and iNOS or exogenous NO from rapid or slow releasing NO donors affect the expression of MadCAM 1 Our data suggest that in this model endogenous NO derived from either iNOS or eNOS does not significantly influence MAdCAM 1 expression however both rapid and slow releasing NO donors can potently inhibit the expression of MAdCAM 1 and reduce lymphocyte endothelial adhesion Materials and Methods Reagents Recombinant mouse TNF was purchased from ENDOGEN Stoughton MA DETA NO

Significance was accepted at p 0 05 Results Effect of NO on MAdCAM 1 in SVEC We investigated the effect of DETA NONOate on TNF induced MAdCAM 1 message in SVEC by RT PCR Figure 1shows the PCR products obtained with the promers which amplify the first and second IgG like domain of MAdCAM 1 7 A strong band is detected as MAdCAM 1 transcript after stimulated with TNF 20 ng ml for 12 h Pretreatment of DETA NONOate 100 M blocked the TNF 20 ng ml 12 h induced MAdCAM 1 transcript 37 3 of TNF treated while there was no equivalent change in GAPDH Figure 1 TNF induces MAdCAM 1 protein expression which is reduced by NO donors TNF 20 ng ml induced MAdCAM 1 expression is blocked both by the short acting and long acting NO donors SperNO and DETA NO respectively SperNO significantly reduces MAdCAM 1 expression at 100 and 1000 uM Fig 2 while the long acting NO donor DETA NO significantly reduced MAdCAM 1 at a only 1 10 the concentration of SperNO needed to reduce MAdCAM 1 expression 10 uM and 100 uM significantly attenuated MAdCAM 1 expresssion NO donors block TNF induces nuclear translocation of p65 Figure 2Cshows that TNF 20 ng ml significantly increased nuclear translocation of p65 a subunit of the p50 p65 NF kB complex In the presence of DETA NO 100 uM or SperNO 100 uM p65 nuclear translocation was significantly blocked as visualized by its appearance in western blotting of nuclear samples NO synthase inhibitors do not induce or enhance TNF induced MAdCAM 1 expression TNF induced MAdCAM 1 was not affected by either a non selective NO synthase inhibitor L NAME 1 mM or by a relatively selective iNOS inhibitor 1400 100 M Fig 3 Adhesion of a4b7 expressing lymphocytes to MAdCAM 1 expressing cells Having established a role of NO donors in the regulation of MAdCAM 1 expression by endothelial cells we examined effects of NO donors on the adhesion of a4b7 expressing mouse lymphocyte cell line TK 1 to TNF treated endothelial cultures Figure 4showed that control adhesion of TK 1 cells was 12 3 0 98 TNF induced maximal adhesion 29 8 1 30 p 0 001 vs untreated control at 24 h This relatively high level of adhesion was inhibited by pre incubation of endothelial monolayers with anti MAdCAM 1 antibody MAdCAM 1 antibody reduced TK 1 adhesion to 17 0 1 18 p 0 001 vs TNF treatment showing that most of the TNF induced lymphocyte adhesion in this model was MAdCAM 1 dependent Similarly treatment of endothelial monolayers with DETA NONOate significantly reduced adhesion to 19 6 0 72 of that induced by TNF alone p 0 001 DETA NONOate did not affect lymphocyte adhesion to untreated endothelial monolayers data not shown Discussion Human IBD is characterized by the extravasation of leukocytes especially lymphocytes into the gut where these cells induce and sustain chronic intestinal inflammation 8 Lymphocyte homing to both normal tissues and to sites of inflammation is regulated in part by differential expression of cell surface homing receptors and their bonds with tissue specific vascular addressins that are sites of lymphocyte recruitment from blood 9 10 11 Lymphocyte homing to mucosal lymphoid tissues such as Peyer s patches and the intestinal lamina propria involves a single chain 60 Kd adhesion glycoprotein the mucosal vascular addressin MAdCAM 1 12 13 MAdCAM 1 is expressed on endothelial cells in mesenteric lymph nodes lamina propria of the small and large intestine and the lactating mammary gland Increased expression of MAdCAM 1 on murine endothelial cells can be induced after stimulation with IL 1 and TNF 13 MAdCAM 1 has also been detected at high levels on colonic lamina propria venules from mice with hapten induced colitis 14 mice injected with TNF 15 or colitic IL 2 knockout mice 16 The interaction of the 4 7 integrin on a subset of T cells with its ligand MAdCAM 1 on high venular and lymphoid endothelial cells has been shown to be support the entry of of these lymphocytes into the gut in IBD 8 However this process is still not well understood Immune models of colitis in mice show that the MAdCAM 1 B7 integrin bond is essential to produce colitis CD45RB highCD4 T lymphocytes which normally home to and populate the colons of severe combined immune deficient SCID mice will not enter the gut after treatment of recipient animals with either MAdCAM 1 or 4 7 specific antibody This shows that this pair of molecules is clearly involved in cell traffic into the inflamed gut 17 Therefore it is possible that there may be unregulated MAdCAM 1 expression in IBD and likely that the control of MAdCAM 1 expression may be an effective potential treatment for IBD With respect to adhesion adhesion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes has been shown to be enhanced by treatment with NOS inhibitors similarly Hokari et al 18 have also demonstrated that L NAME promotes the adhesion of T lymphocytes cells to endothelium in vivo NO is an important modulator of adhesion molecule expression in both acute and chronic inflammatory states and may influence the course of IBD It is known that NO can function both as an oxidant or antioxidant depending on the availability of reactive oxygen species 19 Similarly the concentration of NO can also augment 20 21 or inhibit 22 23 oxygen radical mediated tissue damage and lipid peroxidation It has also been reported that inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthases using the non selective NOS inhibitor L NAME induces endothelial adhesion molecules ICAM 1 and VCAM 1 in HUVEC 24 25 With respect to NO in inflammatory bowel disease Singer et al 26 found that iNOS expression was significantly increased in colonic epithelia from individuals with IBD In iNOS deficient mice McCafferty et al 1997 27 reported that acetic acid induced colitis was more severe in iNOS deficient animals consistent with a protective role of iNOS derived NO in colitis De Caterina et al 28 reported that in another model NO blocked the TNF or IL 1 induced expression of VCAM 1 E selectin and ICAM 1 Similarly GSNO also reduced NF kB activation as measured by EMSA Further Binion et al 29 reported that iNOS expression in human intestinal micro vascular endothelial cells inhibited leukocyte adhesion indicating that iNOS derived NO may control inflammation in human IBD Further support of this hypothesis comes from a more recent report by Binion s group showing that individuals afflicted with Crohn s colitis have an apparent inability to express iNOS in their intestinal microvascular endothelium 29 McCafferty et al 27 30 suggest that in IBD iNOS blocks an early obligatory phase of inflammation but perhaps not the chronic phase Kubes and McCafferty 31 suggest in IBD NO may be either beneficial or detrimental and may reflect the tissue source cell type enzymatic source of NO eNOS vs iNOS and rate of NO production as well as the bioavailability of oxidants in these different models In this present study we investigated how MAdCAM 1 expression in cultured endothelial cells is altered by NO donors and by NO synthase inhibitors We have also examined how cytokines and NO modifying agents control adhesion of 4 7 expressing mouse lymphocytes in response to TNF We observed that both a short and long acting NO donor significantly reduce TNF induced expression of MAdCAM 1 expression in lymphatic endothelial cells The effects of NO donors appear to reflect their ability to prevent the nuclear translocation of NF kB The MAdCAM 1 promoter has several NF kB binding sites 32 and are necessary to induce MAdCAM 1 expression Both a short and long acting NO donor blocked MAdCAM 1 induction but the slow releasing NO DETA NO was apparently at least 10 times more effective than SperNO on a molar basis This probably reflects the need for persistently elevated NO to block cytokine signaling in this system In this model the mechanism through which NO donors limit inflammation is by NF kB inhibition since these NO donors effectively block p65 translocation into the nucleus Khan et al 33 demonstrated that NO donors blocked TNF induced NF B activation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells as measured by EMSA Similarly Spiecker 34 showed that GSNO blocked TNF induced NF B activation by EMSA in human saphenous vein endothelium However in that model I B the inhibitor of the NF kB complex was still degraded Therefore NO might limit NF kB activation through pathways independent of IkB a In that report NO was found to induce I B synthesis through activation of its promoter therefore increased IkB a might also contribute to NF kB inhibition Several other possible pathways e g p38 p42 44 MAPK and transcription factors e g SP1 and possibly AP2 Adh1 ETF PEA3 sites 32 which could also contribute to NF kB dependent gene activation and might participate in NO mediated MAdCAM 1 regulation by cytokines 35 have reported that an NO releasing derivative of mesalamine one agent currently used to treat gut inflammation exhibits enhanced anti inflammatory effects compared to the parent compound While NO donors are not currently used for treatment of IBD the literature and our data here suggest that NO donors could be beneficial An improved understanding of the interactions of these signals may improve our ability to understand the role of MAdCAM 1 in IBD and design effective therapies to treat it Competing
