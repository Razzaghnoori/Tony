 The Unexamined Game Is Not Worth Watching As an achiever I constantly look for new techniques of achievement and seek to minimize behaviors with low achievement yield Thus it is only natural that I have begun to worry about the amount of time I spend watching sports on television an activity that does not measurably advance any of my personal or professional agendas Most alarmingly sports have become a steel curtain between me and my family My wife and three daughters shun me when I turn on a ballgame Occasionally I try to relate to the kids by asking them to fetch Daddy a beer but I sense that they are drifting away that I have become for them every bit as useless burdensome and low yielding in immediate practical utility as they are for me I realized that something had to change I needed to take firm decisive action And so I made a solemn vow I would teach my wife and kids to watch sports with me Yes I would And something more I would become a better more sophisticated more deeply engaged viewer of TV sports I would become a man for whom sports viewership is not just a bad habit but a skill I have sought counsel from experts and engaged in rigorous tests in my own home What follows are some simple precepts for Next Level sports viewership The very first thing you must do before we get into any actual viewing techniques is ask yourself why sports are an important part of your life Why do sports matter Do you like sports because they show that effort practice and innovation lead to positive results Because sports are an outlet for our primitive barbarian hostilities Because in sports we discover a dramatic metaphor for our desire to move into new terrain and reach goals that can be statistically measured The answer to all these questions is Don t be stupid You watch sports for the simple reason that sports don t matter a jot You like sports precisely because of their utter insignificance You find this relaxing Always remember the pre eminent rule of the sports junkie 1 Don t start thinking like George Will Next you must configure your viewing area For help in this regard I called Steve Sabol president of NFL Films Inc the company that produces Inside the NFL for HBO Sabol I knew watches a heroic amount of football from which he gleans the highlights for his films NFL Films has a signature style Sweaty grunting muddy men move in super slow motion while the baritone narrator describes the events as though the fate of nations hung in the balance Sabol a former college football player says That s the way I wanted to show the game with the snot spraying the sweat flying Football is a very visceral sport Before we started it was always filmed from the top and it looked like a little chess set His viewing procedures are quite advanced Every Sunday he watches three games at once I have a little cockpit that s built in my den There s one set the predominant game that s on a 30 inch TV and I have two 19 inch TVs that are slanted inward So it s like a cockpit You have to have good peripheral vision and you have to really concentrate So that s the next tip 2 Get more and bigger televisions If you have only a single 19 inch television and you can t afford to upgrade just sit a lot closer If you get close enough to the set it s almost as good as going out and buying a multi thousand dollar home theater Sabol said he has to take the occasional pit stop but even that is conveniently arranged The bathroom s right by the set If I have to take a piss I can still see the screen 3 Keep your eye on the screen at all times even when you are trying to trim a child s toenails Sabol said he sits in a Relax a back chair a kind of recliner but cautions that this is not for the novice The worst case scenario for the sports viewer is the unplanned nap Those are dangerous I only recommend those for the more experienced viewers You need stamina to do this You need a good night s sleep You have to be careful about having too big a breakfast because that will put you to sleep The trick is to have a series of small snacks for a 10 hour period 4 Come to the television rested Don t eat meals graze Sabol reckons that on a given Sunday he starts watching at 11 a m and doesn t stop until 11 p m at the end of the cable TV broadcast Before his divorce his wife didn t quite understand that this was work he says Now comes the harder stuff the actual watching the seeing if you will of the actions on the screen You must keep in mind that you are not directly watching an event but rather are watching a produced and directed telecast of an event manipulated by talented but not infallible professionals To better understand how a sports program is put together I called Rudy Martzke the TV sports columnist for USA Today who watches between 40 and 60 hours of TV sports a week on the 60 inch Pioneer screen in his family room Martzke is full of facts and well educated opinions The typical Monday Night Football broadcast uses about 13 cameras compared with only about eight for Fox s primary game Sunday afternoon Goodyear s Steadycam allows sharp focus blimp shots even when the blimp is being blown all over the sky the glowing puck used on Fox hockey games is officially called Fox Trax Bob Costas at NBC is the best host in the business and Al Michaels at ABC is the best play by play guy Unseen to viewers but extremely important are the producers and directors The director is the guy who calls the shots you see on the screen He s the one who inserts the graphics says Martzke Got a guy sitting next to him who s called the technical director The director when he yells out the instructions cut to this picture that picture this camera that camera the guy who follows him up physically is the technical director The producer sits to the left of the director The producer is the one who gets in the replays the one who s in charge of the format of the show He makes sure all those commercial breaks get in so they re paid Obviously only Rudy Martzke ever thinks twice about these people but this creates a chance for you to sound authoritative when someone challenges you on your sports viewership expertise Let other people talk about who caught what pass or made what tackle you can say things like Sandy Grossman uses down and yardage graphics better than any director in the game The point of all this is 5 Never let anyone know that you ve forgotten the name of the announcer The hardest part of all is knowing what to look for when you watch television In basketball for example the referee will often blow the whistle and call illegal defense which few viewers ever see in advance This is because they are only watching the ball Illegal defense occurs when a defender plays zone rather than man to man Thus you should always look for someone who s just guarding a patch of the court standing around looking suspicious When you detect an illegal defense before the referee makes the call you have completely arrived as a TV sports viewer In baseball don t just watch the flight of the ball from the pitcher s hand toward the batter Look directly at the pitcher s hand and see if you can see what kind of grip he s using that will tell you whether it s a curve slider fastball splitter knuckleball or whatever In golf look at the wrists and elbows of the golfer as he or she putts The great ones have almost no movement in their arms wrists and hands other than the gentlest of pendulum swings In hockey change channels You will never see the puck When Sabol watches a football game he scrutinizes an area in front of the runner and including the runner It s a semicircle with a radius of about 3 yards he estimates 6 Expand your zone of attention In preliminary tests with my own family I determined that they have a long long long way to go before they are major league sports fans One Sunday I plunked my two oldest daughters in chairs directly in front of the set and channel surfed from baseball to basketball to women s golf to figure skating During the basketball game my medium sized daughter who is not quite 4 said of Joe Dumars Is that a girl So the first thing we will do with this particular daughter is work on gender identification Both daughters meanwhile have decided to become figure skaters when they grow up You can see that this is drifting into a scary area I might teach them to watch sports on television but they might decide that sports includes massive doses of Brian Boitano and Oksana Baiul My natural inclination is to watch figure skating quadrennially Mary my wife is simply a lost cause She is an extremely discerning person who can detect the most subtle spice in a bowl of soup or a whisper of colored thread in a suit jacket but for some reason she can stare at a basketball game on television and miss the important details such as the ball going into the hoop What just happened I demanded to know after Michael Jordan made a jump shot during a Chicago Bulls game I don t know I was still thinking about the last commercial she said 7 Don t pay attention to the commercials the squeakiness of the basketball court the spitting in the dugout the sweating or fluids of any kind Once the techniques of viewing are mastered there remains a major step analysis There is no point in watching if one is not really seeing anything Sabol gave me a final tip that I will carry with me the rest of my years 8 Prepare You have to come into the game prepared You have to come into watching the game with your own game plan Sabol said What are you going to look for What are the keys to the game It s a rule from scouting Be prepared Think ahead Anticipate problems and possible solutions If you pick up the book The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People you will see that one of the habits is be pro active Do not wait for the ballgame on television to come to you You can go to the ballgame mentally emotionally pro actively You can be a better sports viewer than anyone on your block anyone with your ZIP code Life is a competition Be a champion
