 Sex Machines The painter of the machine age That s the standard line on the French painter Fernand L ger 1881 1955 It s also the theme of the retrospective the first in New York in 43 years to be devoted to him mounted at the Museum of Modern Art It s easy enough to go along with too especially with Anjelica Huston s voice purring in your ear audiotapes have replaced wall panels for this show about how L ger was peerless in portraying the feel of the modern city A hulk of a man with a capacious appetite for women and red wine L ger seemed the right choice to muscle French painting out of the cafe and the artist s studio and into the world of steel girders and factory smoke He took elements from the major 20 th century schools of art Cubism but also Futurism Neoclassicism and Surrealism and forged his own peculiar idiom one that seemed as racy and street smart as slang Of the modern masters he came closest to capturing the dynamism and rhythm of our headlong century But beyond his up to the minute virtuosity L ger doesn t play his designated role of machine age hero all that convincingly Born on a Normandy farm the only child of a cattle breeder L ger never lost a palpable nostalgia for the countryside reminders of which appear in some of his most urban paintings such as the incongruous tree branches on the elevated platform in Construction Workers of 1950 By 1900 he had made his way to Paris where he first trained as an architect then studied at a couple of traditional art academies He fell in with the Cubists whose reverence for C zanne s Formalist innovations depicting landscape and figures with interlocking planes he shared Later L ger would claim he freed himself from C zanne by means of abstraction the path breaking paintings he called Contrast of Forms circa 1913 fully abstract exercises in funnels cylinders and arcs retain all their vigorous charm During World War I L ger served for a year in the worst regions of the Western Front It was a democratizing experience by his own account making him feel as he put it in an often quoted remark on a level with the whole of the French people His extraordinary Card Game 1917 uses those contrasting forms to reconfigure a traditional genre subject C zanne s Card Players is the most familiar example L ger captures a leisurely break from the battlefield routine but his tin can soldiers are still fully armored and their cards suggest an equation between war and a game of chance The earth colored table is as riven and scarred as the trenches of the Argonne After the war came The City 1919 probably his single most famous painting Some grimly monochromatic figures mount the stairway in the center of the picture returning soldiers perhaps but otherwise the city seems a cheerful colorful refuge decked with tasteful advertising posters Never has the poetry of the first machine age been so grandly and proudly exalted comments the art historian John Golding in the exhibition catalog Maybe so but there s something opportunistic about L ger s abrupt embrace of urban life It s as though after wrestling long and hard with C zanne s dictum that the artist should paint the world of nature in terms of spheres cylinders and cones L ger realized Hey here s an environment that s actually made of these shapes The cogs and pistons that dominate his paintings of the early 1920s remain unusually intimate human scale It s true that he s drawn to machinery but his favorite devices are typewriters and accordions and siphons nonthreatening mechanisms that lack the depersonalizing menacing quality of say Fritz Lang s nightmarish film Metropolis Although L ger was a Communist with pronounced sympathy for the working man his experience of factory conditions apparently was limited to what he d heard from his fellow card playing soldiers His Social Realist Construction Workers was displayed in the canteen of the Renault auto factory to predictably tepid response It was the same factory where the French philosopher Simone Weil worked long hours to experience the true lot of the worker The alienation of modern life a central theme in the work of L ger s literary friends Henry Miller and Blaise Cendrars doesn t enter the painter s resolutely optimistic vision Even New York City where he waited out World War II takes on cozy contours for L ger who was quickly hired by Nelson Rockefeller to decorate his New York apartment the fireplace surround is in the MoMA show L ger saw the city of the 1940s through a 1920s temperament reworking a drawing of 1924 into his appealing oil The Three Musicians 1944 a particular hit of the MoMA show The looming skyscrapers of Georgia O Keefe s between the wars paintings or Charles Sheeler s threatening smokestacks have no counterpart in L ger s work His Good bye New York 1946 the cover illustration for the exhibition catalog has no urban feel at all despite some free floating girders and a row of neckties glimpsed at a Times Square stall The stray fences and tree limbs from the upstate countryside where L ger spent his summers are more prominent Back in Paris he painted stilted idylls in the countryside utopias no one would want to live in The most sophisticated machinery here is the bicycle The story that MoMA s show tells about L ger his heroic struggle with C zanne his escape into abstraction his flirtation with competing schools of Modernism his late monumentality is the same story that MoMA s permanent collection tells with Picasso as the hero But there s another way to think of L ger s development As the machinery shrank in his pictures his women grew in prominence and size So many Modernist breakthroughs involved the visual dismantling of a woman Picasso s Demoiselles d Avignon 1907 on the second floor of MoMA de Kooning s Woman I 1950 51 on the third that it should come as no surprise that L ger began the same way with his systematically fragmented Woman in Blue 1912 the first piece in the exhibition Many of L ger s key paintings seem to have been inspired by the question of what women are exactly Are they companions in the human realm or visitors from the natural or even the mechanical world Are they animal vegetable or mineral The metallic moving parts of Woman in Blue yield to the Neoclassical contours of the marmoreal Three Women 1921 who are as still as the still life lunch they ll never eat has a primitive Easter Island look L ger paints a holly leaf in exactly the same black on red idiom as though the nude woman is a botanical exhibit A decade later in his Composition With Two Parrots 1935 39 the women are still bulbous and inert but there s blood in their veins The painting suggests an equation between two forms of wildlife the clothed boy holds a parrot his companion holds a woman L ger s ideas about women are inseparable from his ideas about machinery His clever Ballet M canique an influential little non narrative film he made in 1924 MoMA has it on a continuous reel intercuts dancing pistons and kitchenware with blinking eyes and a mouth that opens and closes rhythmically The idea L ger claimed was to prove that machines and fragments of them that ordinary manufactured objects have plastic possibilities In other words detached from their familiar uses and manipulated on film such objects could be animated rendered flexible and in the sculptural sense plastic Conversely L ger was also implying that human beings are composed of moving parts But the blinking eyes in his mechanical ballet are heavy with mascara while the sexy mouth shines with lipstick In his dreams of the future L ger wanted his machines to be as sexy and intimate as beautiful women and his women to be as available and predictable as household appliances
