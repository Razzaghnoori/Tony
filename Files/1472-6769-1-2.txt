 Background The seven conformer dataset The Taxol molecule is a complex diterpenoid with a conformationally immobile core consisting of the fused A D rings Side chains critical for bioactivity of the molecule and analogs are those emanating from the core at C2 C4 and C13 To evaluate the energetic performance of various computational schemes seven Taxol conformations derived from experimental data with differing torsional angles in the C13 fragment were examined The diversity of C3 side chain orientations is illustrated in Figure 2 in which the diterpenoid core A C rings have been superimposed and amplified with reference to specific torsions in Table 1 The first five are those with the highest estimated populations 4 to 35 with a G range of 0 0 1 3 kcal mol from an NMR NAMFIS analysis in CDC1 3 solution 11 12 Structure 1 corresponds to the non polar conformation observed as the predominant species in CDC1 3 or CD 2 Cl 2 as depicted in Figure 3 Characteristic of the form is the hydrophobic collapse 13 of the benzamido phenyl at C3 and the benzoyl phenyl at C2 The point is illustrated by the short 5 4 distance between the centers of the corresponding phenyl rings Conformer 2 experiences a similar collapse with a somewhat shorter ring to ring distance derived from an alternative set of torsions along the C13 side chain Table 1 With respect to the close approach between pendant hydrophobic centers 1 and 2 resemble the semisynthetic analog of Taxol Taxotere docitaxel The latter compound differs constitutionally from Taxol in that the C10 acetate becomes an OH and the NHC O Ph benzamido group is replaced by NHC O O t Bu The single crystal X ray structure 14 and the 2 D NMR CDCl 3 6d of Taxotere likewise demonstrate hydrophobic association in this case between the tert butyl and the C2 phenyl group Structure 5 is the polar form frequently found in DMSO d 6 D 2 O It too exhibits hydrophobic collapse but between the Taxol phenyl ring attached directly to C3 and the C2 benzoyl ring Figure 2 Isomers 3 and 4 are extended rotamers in which the C2 benzoyl phenyl ring is distant from both C3 terminal rings Rotamer 4 corresponds to the recently proposed bioactive conformation of Taxol bound to tubulin 9 The perspective given as 4 illustrates the T relationship between the three phenyl rings of the molecule Figure 2 The final two Taxol conformers included in our dataset 6 and 7 appear together in the unit cell of an X ray crystal structure determination 15 The latter is a C13 side chain extended structure while hydrophobically collapsed 6 is very similar to 5 Table 1complements Figure 3in providing a selected set of dihedral angles to illustrate explicitly the conformational variation among the seven Taxol torsional isomers Results Five conclusions are immediately evident from Tables 2 3 4 1 For a given medium gas CHCl 3 H 2 O there is no consistency in energy ranking within the molecular mechanics methods MM3 96 and MM3 2000 performing similar to MM3 offer no exceptions 2 None of the force field solvation models posit non polar 1 to be favored in CHCl 3 while only MM3 predicts polar 5 and 6 to be most stable in the water continuum model Table 2 3 About half of the force field protocols in Table 2suggest the extended uncollapsed conformer 4 to be lowest in energy 4 Use of 6 31G quality ESP charges as recommended for the continuum solvation models 2b 16 leads to conformer 2 a non polar type conformer distinct from 1 as the uniform global minimum for both gas phase and solution models Table 3 The next lowest conformer is predicted to be 15 25 kcal mol higher in energy while overall conformer ranking between the different force fields generally inharmonious Thus incorporation of ESP charges amplifies and alters the energy rankings 5 AM1 and PM3 calculations in the gas phase vary in suggesting 2 6 and 7 as most stable Table 4 While H 2 O solvation correctly identifies polar 6 the CHCl 3 model also favors either 6 or extended 7 rather than 1 or 2 Discussion Electrostatic interactions dominate and differ across methods For Taxol application of commonly applied force fields as well as the semiempirical methods AM1 and PM3 results in an ordering of conformational energies that is method dependent and mostly inconsistent with experimental data In an attempt to understand this behavior within the force field framework we examined the various energy contributions for each conformation and method In most cases the overwhelming factor is the electrostatic term a component that is seriously amplified by incorporating ESP charges The point is likewise illustrated by damping rather than magnifying intramolecular electrostatics Taxol includes ten polar functionalities five 3 atom units four esters one amide and five 1 or 2 atom units three OHs one ether one C9 carbonyl In one set of calculations the latter five groups were converted to the hydrocarbon analogs CH 3 CH 2 and C CH 2 respectively The optimized structures Table 5 are very similar to those cited in Tables 2and 3 but the individual global minima are shifted to different conformers When the five C O X units are converted to trans butene moieties now removing all heteroatoms and most of the electrostatics in the molecule the energy minima shift once again and the average energy spread between high and low unconstrained energy conformations i e 1 5 diminishes to an average of 2 8 kcal mol Table 5 The latter is to be compared with an average of 7 5 and 57 6 kcal mol for the fully optimized structures of Tables 2and 3 respectively The molecular mechanics results might be ascribed to the presence of low quality 17 parameters in the force fields employed Indeed MM3 and MMFF involve 74 and 62 such interactions out of a total of 439 and 555 17 and 11 respectively However MM2 and AMBER incorporate only 2 and 6 such parameters respectively yet their ability to accurately predict the purported experimental forms is not improved The two semiempirical methods each locate 2 6 conformations with energies no more than 2 5 kcal mol above the lowest but none of the calculations selects the same set of low energy conformers Modern force fields with stretch bend torsional hydrogen bond and cross terms are parameterized primarily within three bond units A B X Y Of the two additional key terms the van der Waals component operates with a very short range force and essentially prevents atom atom interpenetration In the absence of damping the single long range interaction that persists from one end of the molecule to the other is the electrostatic contribution While individual bond dipoles are characteristic of the Allinger MM family of force fields other molecular mechanics methods employ atomic charges In either case no general scheme for parameterizing the electrostatic interaction among multiple polar groups in three space in terms of conformational energies has yet emerged Similarly within a quantum chemical semiempirical framework charge polarization notwithstanding conformational energies are sensitive to method and charge distribution Inspection of Table 4reveals that unlike the force field results described in Tables 2and 3 all four semiempirical recipes predict polar conformers 5 and 6 to be the low and global minimum energy forms respectively when the aqueous solvation continuum model is employed The one exception AM1 AM1 suggests both polar and nonpolar forms 6 and 2 to be equally populated This limited success is negated however by the incorrect prediction that the same polar species are also the low energy forms in the gas phase and in the CHCl 3 solvation model In no instance do the semiempirical calculations predict either nonpolar forms 1 or 2 to be dominant in CHCl 3 As mentioned above the AM1 AM1 calculations posit equal populations for 2 and 6 within the latter regime but they simultaneously relegate nonpolar 1 to a higher energy The remaining semiempirical methods predict the empirically verified nonplar conformers 1 and 2 to be unobservable in the chlorocarbon solvent with energies ranging from 3 8 to 6 9 kcal mol above the polar collapsed conformation It might be concluded that the water model is robust while the chloroform model is ill parameterized although the AMSOL literature on solvation 18 gives little basis for this contention Alternatively the few inerrant predictions for 6 combining both structure and continuum aqueous solvation energies might well be fortuitous The likelihood that this is correct is accentuated by the fact that Taxol conformational analysis by NMR has never been performed in pure water but always as a mixture of DMSO d 6 and D 2 O 5 In addition in anhydrous methanol a solvent with a high dielectric and the capacity for explicit hydrogen bonding as in water the polar form goes undetected 5b T Taxol the butterfly conformation For the unsuspecting organic or medicinal chemist however either interpretation is equally unfortunate Faced with a large poly polar organic structure and a solvation equipped semiempirical package the user is limited by the proposition that the aqueous solvation model might provide the correct global minimum but that other conformers may or may not be assigned an appropriate relative energy In less polar chlorocarbon solvents the Taxol structure and other molecules with similar complexity do not appear to be capable of even qualitative ranking by the various methods with respect to energy An interesting but fortuitous outcome in this respect is that conformer 4 the T or butterfly conformer of Taxol is predicted to be the dominant conformation by MMFF AMBER and MM2 under various protocols Table 2 Semiempirical models likewise predict it to be of low energy though not the most stable Table 4 This conformer was assigned a low population in the multi conformational analysis of Taxol in chloroform 12 used in the fitting of the electron crystallographic density of the tubulin Taxol complex in zinc stabilized sheets and ultimately assessed as the binding conformation for Taxol in this structure 9 A unique but difficulty observed conformer computational methodology overestimates its stability and might have led to its discovery by misrepresentation While the operation of serendipity is much to be desired in the drug seeking process errant methodology is the least desired path to discovery Conclusions As a consequence of the above considerations for highly polar molecules like Taxol it is overoptimisitic to expect that conformational searching based on a computational energy criterion will yield results faithful to experiment The use of solvent continuum models clearly does not ameliorate the situation Our observations and those of Halgren 4 suggest that a given force field or quantum chemical method selected for potential application to a highly polar molecular system be carefully validated to assure that conformational energy comparisons are not spurious Until this problem can be addressed at a fundamental theoretical level it would seem prudent to employ an energy free conformational search protocol We find the NAMFIS approach valuable in this respect 11 12 19 however there are a number of equally attractive alternatives 20 that in principle can also bypass the energy catastrophe Future work will be devoted to examining a range of functionalized organic molecules in order to define the boundary of molecular polarity within which standard conformational search methodology can be applied with confidence Materials and Methods Force fields and semiempirical methods applied to Taxol The study was conducted by employing four popular force fields in MacroModel6 5 MM2 MM3 AMBER and MMFF 2 Each was used in the gas phase with two continuum solvation models CHCl 3 H 2 O 2b with default MacroModel atomic charges Table 2 To provide a comparison with MacroModel we also tested solvated MM3 96 and polarization enhanced MM3 2000 21 In addition the seven AMBER conformations were fitted with MNDO electrostatic potential ESP charges scaled to the 6 31G level 22 23 and the calculations repeated Table 3 The structures were also fully optimized with the AM1 and PM3 semiempirical methods 22 and supplemented by AMSOL SM5 4a solvation energies Table 4 24
