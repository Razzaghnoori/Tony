                            Despite the biases that a single author inevitably brings to a subject only one or a        few closely interacting authors can bring coherence synthesis and vision to a broad and        complex topic A symposium volume just doesnt do the job Few topics in biology are as        simultaneously encompassing complex and controversial as the origin of species ie        speciation Speciation is after all the process responsible for biological diversity at        least of sexual organisms so it is hardly a minor topic But even though recent years have        seen the publication of symposia on speciation and books on the evercontentious issue of        species concepts it has been  years since Verne Grants authoritative         Plant Speciation  and  years since Ernst Mayrs magisterial and        highly influential         Animal Species and Evolution the last syntheses of research on        speciation Now two outstanding new books not only treat speciation as a conceptually        unified topic in both plants and animals for the first time but also provide rich review        and analysis of a vast subject that has progressed at least as much since Mayr and Grant        wrote as in the century that preceded their work        These books are very different but wonderfully complementary Gavrilets reviews and        adds to mathematical theories and simulation studies of speciation and related issues such        as fitness landscapes and selection in heterogeneous environments A deep reading of his        book will require considerably more mathematical competence than most evolutionary        biologists including this reviewer have but Gavrilets provides excellent verbal        explanations of the models assumptions and conclusions as well as comparisons and        critiques of related models Gavrilets cites empirical studies with which he has very        broad familiarity plentifully but as a theoretician he does not evaluate them or        describe them in depth That task is undertaken by Coyne and Orr who introduce most topics        with a verbal overview of theory review empirical evidence and its bearing on hypotheses        and conclude with incisive assessments of what they think we know and what remains        uncertain or unexplored Like Gavrilets they offer a number of novel ideas or suggestions        about how to proceed Coyne and Orr have both worked mostly on speciation genetics in         Drosophila  so it is hardly surprising that their treatment of        speciation bears a strong genetic emphasis and draws heavily on         Drosophila work perforce since this is almost the only source        of evidence on some topics such as the genetics of hybrid sterility and inviability Even        the most drosophilophobic readers however will be pleased by the extent to which Coyne        and Orr have conscientiously scoured the literature on nonmodel animals and plants        To appreciate the landmark status of these books consider what has happened in        speciation studies since Mayr and Grant published theirs Mayr and Grant articulated        positions on species and speciation that had developed during and soon after the Modern        Synthesis of the s and s when modern evolutionary theory developed from a        reconciliation of genetics systematics and paleontology Mayr and Grant drew on abundant        systematic data on patterns of divergence and experimental data on genetic differences        between related species They rightly identified reproductive isolation RI as a critical        even defining property of species and allopatric divergence ie in disjunct geographic        areas as the major geographic mode of speciation They recognized that trait differences        between species including RI usually have a polygenic basis and that different coadapted        epistatically interacting sets of genes underlie incompatibility eg hybrid        sterility They emphasized the role of ecological selection as a driving force in        speciation largely by extrapolation from the primacy of selectionist thinking that        developed during the Synthesis They accepted that natural selection can reinforce        prezygotic isolation ie lack of mating or zygote formation between species and thereby        reduce production of unfit hybrids even if Mayr did not share Dobzhanskys belief that        this was the norm Mayr combined selection with genetic drift in his theory of        foundereffect speciation divergence in populations founded by just a few individuals        which became widely accepted It became Eldredge and Goulds  theoretical foundation        for punctuated equilibrium nine years after Mayrs book appeared Mayr and Grant wrote        against a background that almost entirely lacked any mathematical theory of speciation        which I suspect neither of them would have drawn on even if it had been developed any        relevant molecular data other than early allozyme studies by the time Grant published        and any rigorous phylogenetic methodology Kimuras neutral theory of molecular evolution         had not yet been published when Mayr wrote and had not been vindicated when Grant        wrote so genetic drift and a neutral nonselectionist interpretation of molecular data        were still suspect Detailed analysis of genetic architecture was decades away and of        course insights into selection and historical demography from DNA sequence data were a dim        dream at best        Coyne and Orr and Gavrilets analyze a new world of speciation studies Theoretical        studies of speciation for example now include more than  papers on one topic alone        the evolution of prezygotic isolation Gavrilets laments that the theoretical work suffers        from domination by simulation rather than analysis so that it is often hard to draw        general conclusions from models that use different assumptions but he nevertheless draws        some fairly strong conclusions as I note below Molecular studies have provided important        data on such issues as the absolute dates of speciation events the duration of speciation        and the time course of the evolution of RI The field of molecular phylogeography which        documents the history of spatial isolation and geographic expansion of populations has        developed The relation between range overlap of related species and their molecularly        dated time of divergence provides some evidence on the role of geographic versus sympatric        speciation ie speciation without geographic segregation In all these areas and        others our knowledge has increased steadily For instance molecular markers enable more        detailed dissection of the genetic architecture of species differences and support the        conclusion that they are usually rather highly polygenic but that much of the variance can        be explained by a few major gene substitutions We now have good evidence as Coyne and Orr        emphasize that at least in animals hybrid infertility is caused by differences in gene        action not by structural chromosome differences or failure of meiosis        Regarding the mechanisms of speciation evidence for the role of divergent ecological        selection in allopatric speciation is sparse because this crucial topic has been        unaccountably neglected until recently Very different kinds of data ranging from DNA        sequences to correspondence between RI and ecological divergence support natural        selection but there is hardly enough evidence in my opinion to support Coyne and Orrs        strong conclusion that at least one important debate has been settled selection plays a        much larger role in speciation than does drift p  Even more astonishing than the        paucity of studies of the role of ecological selection in speciation is the fact that the        likely role of sexual selection was not even recognized until almost  years after Mayrs        book I agree with Coyne and Orr that the theory and evidence for speciation by sexual        selection is one of the most important advances in speciation studies but it is important        to recognize that the evidence consists mostly of correlations between diversification        rates and indices of the likely strength of sexual selection as Coyne and Orr note there        are no cases in which we understand just how sexual selection has caused speciation This        is a rich largely unexplored area Gavrilets feels that divergent evolution by sexual        conflict in which females evolve resistance to males advances is a potentially important        process whereas Coyne and Orr are skeptical that this will prove widespread Coyne and Orr        remark that populations may diverge in male signals because of intrasexual selection        competition among males and that female mate preference may follow Quite so but even        though Berglund et al  summarized many examples in which male signals appear to serve        both inter and intrasexual functions this topic has been almost ignored in the literature        of both speciation and sexual selection On a related theme an important speciation        process appears to be the extraordinarily rapid evolution of male reproductive proteins        eg sperm surface proteins which may contribute to the faster male evolution that is        a cause of Haldanes rule that hybrid sterility and inviability first appear in the sex        that has two unlike sex chromosomes        Despite their very different approaches Coyne and Orr and Gavrilets arrive at rather        similar conclusions on some of the most controversial issues in speciation One such is the        role of genetic drift in speciation Gavrilets analyzes foundereffect speciation which        combines drift and selection agrees with most other theoreticians eg Barton and        Charlesworth  that it is very improbable and argues instead for his model of evolution        on holey landscapes whereby allopatric populations can evolve by genetic drift along        ridges of roughly equal fitness to different incompatible gene constitutions He admits        that the time to speciation under this process will ordinarily be very long unless        selection is involved Coyne and Orr fully accept both Barton and Charlesworths critique        and Gavriletss alternative model But while admitting the plausibility of Gavriletss        models of speciation by genetic drift they nevertheless maintain that the models seem        unnecessary when compared to adaptive ones p         Coyne and Orr appear to adopt selection as the null hypothesis for speciation whereas        drift is generally taken as the null hypothesis in much of evolutionary genetics for the        simple reason that drift operates at all loci in all finite ie real populations        whereas selection need not The burden of demonstrating that selection is         not responsible for an evolutionary event ie demonstrating a        negative is of course far heavier than the burden of demonstrating selection indeed        Coyne and Orr do not address the difficult question of what would constitute evidence for        drift Having perhaps stacked the deck Coyne and Orr find almost no evidence that drift        has contributed to speciation in nature but conclude that there is considerable evidence        that selection has done so However the amount of evidence is hardly on a par with say        the evidence for allopatric speciation It consists of only about eight studies of        ecological selection indications that diversification rates are associated with greater        scope for sexual selection selection signatures in a few genes that underlie genetic        incompatibility and a paucity of molecular evidence for bottlenecks ie opportunities        for founder events in the history of recently formed species But the evidence on the role        of sexual selection is very indirect and the high levels of genetic variation revealed in        molecular studies argue against past bottlenecks only if this is ancestral variation        rather than variation generated anew since a possible bottlenecka question that has been        addressed in only a few cases Assuming that experiments with laboratory populations can be        validly extrapolated to natural speciation processes foundereffect speciation may indeed        be a moribund hypothesis but I do not believe longterm genetic drift can yet be ruled        out and cannot agree that this important debate has been settled p         The geography of speciation continues to be one of the most difficult and contentious        topics and undoubtedly will remain so despite the careful analyses by these authors They        agree that parapatric speciation evolution of RI between neighboring populations that        exchange genes is theoretically plausible but Gavrilets notes that although it has become        clear that its likelihood is sensitive to several model parameters parapatric speciation        is difficult to model and has been shamefully neglected Coyne and Orr do not doubt that it        is a fairly common mode of speciation yet it is almost impossible to demonstrate        parapatric speciation in nature p  and no cases have been well documented        Gavrilets provides an exhaustive analysis of the many models of sympatric speciation        and identifies some key issues that have been underemphasized For example the sympatric        evolution of behavioral isolation by matching traits eg genetically independent male        signal and female preference is generally much more difficult than similaritybased        mating in which females choose males that have the same phenotypic trait as themselves        Just how common the latter is in animals is an open question that Coyne and Orr        unfortunately do not address Gavrilets also identifies the cost of female choosiness as a        critical issue many models of sympatric speciation depend on the assumption that females        always succeed in mating even if the male type they prefer is rare so their choosiness has        no cost Gavrilets criticizes some popular models of sympatric speciation on these and        other grounds and while granting that sympatric speciation by divergent habitat or host        preference is plausible he concludes that it need not be faster than allopatric speciation        and that contrary to common claims in recent theoretical papers conditions for sympatric        speciation are not wide and sympatric speciation does not occur easily p         For their part Coyne and Orr feel that the prevalence of sympatric speciation is an        empirical issue but a very difficult one and undertake a broad detailed review They        identify three examples of completed speciation in which a sympatric scenario seems        plausible I see no reason to accept one of these cases a pair of sister species of        parasites fig wasps on the same host species since allopatric speciation of a        widespread parasite need not be accompanied by speciation of its host Moreover Coyne and        Orr note weaknesses in all three cases as well as in examples of host races that have        been advanced as species         in statu nascendi  Coyne and Orrs conclusion echoes Gavriletss It is        hard to see how the data at hand can justify the current wave of enthusiasm for sympatric        speciation p          Bravi        I have indicated some disagreements with Coyne and Orr and could certainly cite others        But whatever weaknesses their book may have more ecology and phylogeny anyone are much        less important than its strengths The strengths of         Speciation are not only Coyne and Orrs comprehensive scholarly coverage        of an exceedingly broad subject but also and especially their rigorous incisive        analysis coupled with strongly stated conclusions and suggestions for how to resolve        controversies Many readers will have a visceral reaction against their position on        sympatric speciation reinforcement foundereffect speciation or other issuesbut can        these readers counter Coyne and Orrs arguments with equally cogent analysis Or are these        subjects that simply require more and perhaps more imaginative research        Together these books provide a comprehensive thoughtful synthesis of our current        understanding of one of the most important processes in evolution They are required        reading for anyone who studies species and speciation I recommend         Speciation and the nonmathematical final chapter General Conclusions        of         Fitness Landscapes and the Origin of Species to all evolutionary        biologists students and professionals alike It may not take another two decades for the        next foundational books on speciation to appear but these books will fill that role for a        long time to come
