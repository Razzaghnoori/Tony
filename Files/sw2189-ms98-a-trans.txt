 oh no i hadn t heard about Bo Jackson though what happened well Bo was uh playing football actually you know he plays both football and baseball and baseball and he was plays and during a tackle he ended up either damaging his hip or you know injuring his hip yeah plays for the Raiders and there s been arthritis and he s been out for a number of of seasons games and it just as of announced today the Kansas City Royals put him up on waivers made him a free agent so they re saying now that Bo knows arthritis and it could be actually a career ending injury uh i didn t know that so they had uh they re having actually a special on today and they were mentioning that and even though Kansas City may have dropped him some other teams may pick him up but the big thing was that Nike uh the athletic shoe company is still going to keep him on as one of there cross trainer sponsors and since that makes him more money anyhow well yeah it does he has more money out of the uh ads than he does the game itself yeah he does it it s pretty amazing though how much he can get for endorsements anymore i well i think uh Joe Montana got something like a million dollars for saying i m going to Disneyland i wouldn t be surprised whatsoever on the same program they had Michael Jordan they were saying that he gets about six million dollars for playing with the Chicago Bulls about i think two million dollars for endorsing McDonald s and fourteen million dollars for his endorsements with Nike and then of course he s got uh Wheaties also outrageous prices yeah and that s that s in a year that s uh what would you do with all that money uh i i wouldn t know what to do with it we just discussing what we d do with five thousand yeah i could make that go a lot of places it s amazing anymore there s a also a program on this evening about the a very sports intensive evening it seems to be on TV about the business of college athletics uh the uh achievement for the let s see how are they putting that uh the school let s see the academic report board review board uh the dean s being it more involved with the athletes uh huh yeah i was watching that yeah it it talked about all SMU and their the death penalty and how they re getting around all the regulations and rules and and things of that nature i guess anymore it s just a big business yeah well uh some of for most of the people i guess it is for some of them though they do it just for the love of it uh huh uh i think it also probably also more is more as you get into the the big schools the ones that the TVs are going to cover and things anyhow when you still have the the lower sides or the smaller schools they re all doing it just for the for the love of the game because they re not getting the big revenues from anyone well that s not necessarily true though you know uh i m an avid uh basketball fan of Bull uh huh and i know that the coach there gets a million dollars when he quits yeah or you know and so you know he s doing it because he wants to they actually mentioned a little on the fact that he s started to instigate a program where he s actually uh not necessary they say he s getting around the rules somewhat but it s actually sounds like a pretty good idea where he goes out and recruits other students who don t meet the minimum academic requirements to get into the college and and then qualify for a student athlete position and he takes them and signs some contract or something with them but sends them then then to junior college yeah i heard about that i haven t heard much about it though so at least that s uh some way that they re you know i i guess the best part about it you can t just drop off all scholarship scholarships because it does i would imagine at least in it s intentions help a lot of people who couldn t afford to go to school yeah but that seemed like it was actually uh you know if there s a good way to get around a rule that sounded like it was a pretty smart way you don t think yeah i don t know if it would be dishonest or honest though well uh at least it s hopefully still helping the the student yeah it s yeah it s helping the kids you re not uh going to graduate somebody who still can t read and write uh it s happened too much that s way too much yes it has yeah well we veered from the subject yeah but that s quite all right i think they just want to have some kind of normal conversation i hope so it s happened to me more than once does it yeah almost all the time really well there s been uh actually some pretty interesting interesting topics that i ve had i ve had things from uh tax reform to baseball to fishing those are the three i ve participated in i haven t had anything on fishing i ve had uh oh arts and crafts uh football basketball and baseball uh huh well heck you child rearing or child day care uh huh and couple other things i can t remember wow sounds like you participated quite a bit yeah well almost everyday the the lines are open uh huh do you normally receive the calls or is it pretty much split uh half and half is it well that s good oh you know uh i had to start out doing it i done it about five times and then uh here lately they i ve been letting them catch me um hum well that s good well it s been enjoyable speaking with you all right well you take it easy bye all righty good bye
