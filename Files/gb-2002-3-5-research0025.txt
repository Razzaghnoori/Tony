 Background Aerobic organisms produce intracellular thiols such as glutathione GSH homoglutathione 1 glutamylcysteine Glu Cys 2 glutamylcysteinylserine 3 and mycothiol 4 for protection against reactive oxygen species formed as by products of aerobic metabolism GSH is the most common of these In addition to buffering the redox status of the cytoplasm and protecting biomolecules against oxidative damage GSH provides reducing equivalents to several enzymes including ribonucleotide reductase 5 3 phosphoadenosine 5 phosphosulfate reductase 6 and arsenate reductase 7 and serves as a substrate for glutathione S transferases which detoxify potentially dangerous electrophiles GSH is found primarily in Gram negative bacteria and eukaryotes and only rarely in Gram positive bacteria Figure 1 It is not found in the Archaea or in amitochondrial eukaryotes such as Entamoeba histolytica 8 Giardia duodenalis 9 Trichomonas vaginalis 10 and Trichomonas foetus 9 This distinctive pattern led to the proposal that the genes for GSH biosynthesis may have been transferred to eukaryotes from bacteria via the progenitor of mitochondria 8 11 12 If this hypothesis is true then the genes for GSH biosynthesis in eukaryotes should resemble those from alpha proteobacteria the modern relatives of the mitochondrial progenitor 13 14 The biosynthesis of GSH Figure 2 requires only two enzymes Glu Cys ligase GshA catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between the carboxylate of glutamate and cysteine GSH synthetase GshB catalyzes the subsequent formation of a peptide bond between the cysteinyl carboxylate of Glu Cys and the amino group of glycine Each of these reactions requires hydrolysis of ATP to drive formation of the peptide bond We have analyzed the sequences of genes encoding GshA and GshB and have discovered that the evolutionary history of these genes is more complex than expected Our results are consistent with two possible explanations for the distribution of GshA genes The most likely possibility is that GshA arose in the bacterial domain and the gene was transferred to eukaryotes at an early stage in their evolution A second less appealing possibility is that a GshA gene was present in the last common ancestor and was subsequently lost from many organisms primarily those that live under anaerobic conditions GshB appears to have arisen independently within bacteria and eukaryotes subsequent to the acquisition of the GshA gene Notably in each domain the scaffold typical of the ATP grasp superfamily was utilized to provide GshB Multiple examples of lateral transfer of the GshA gene are evident the most dramatic being a trans domain transfer from an alpha proteobacterium to a plant sometime before 300 million years ago Results and discussion GshA sequences fall into three distinct groups We assembled an initial set of GshA sequences by searching the NCBI Protein database 15 using either GshA or glutamate cysteine ligase as query words The set was expanded using the output of BLAST 16 searches with the sequences from Escherichia coli Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana Some of the sequences found in the BLAST searches correspond to hypothetical proteins whose functions have not been experimentally verified For organisms that are known to synthesize GSH these sequences are likely to encode GshA However the assignment of function is uncertain for the sequences from Mycobacterium tuberculosis Streptomyces coelicolor and Clostridium acetobutylicum because these organisms are not known to synthesize GSH 4 17 The sequences in the GshA set fall into three distinct groups Table 1 that have no significant relationship to each other on the basis of pairwise sequence identities The first group consists primarily of gamma proteobacteria the second of non plant eukaryotes and the third primarily of flowering plants and alpha proteobacteria Pairwise sequence identities within each group range from 24 to 93 for group 1 from 32 to 98 for group 2 and from 45 to 93 for group 3 Group 1 corresponds to the GCS entry in the Pfam database 18 The clustering of GshA sequences into three groups was confirmed using PSI BLAST 16 PSI BLAST is an iterative form of BLAST in which sequence information from hits found with an initial query sequence is incorporated into a profile that is used in subsequent searches We carried out PSI BLAST searches using GshA sequences from E coli group 1 gi12517129 Drosophila melanogaster group 2 gi7290879 and Mesorhizobium loti group 3 gi13475748 In each case PSI BLAST converged within a few iterations three two and five respectively and no members of the other groups were found even with statistically insignificant scores data not shown Cyanobacterial sequences not shown in Table 1 are found in the PSI BLAST output for group 3 but are quite distantly related to the other group 3 sequences typically less than 20 sequence identity The lack of significant overall sequence identity between the members of these groups could indicate that these proteins arrived at a common function by convergent evolution from different progenitors or that the sequences have diverged so far that evolutionary relationships are no longer readily apparent For truly related but very divergent proteins it is often possible to identify locally conserved regions that are important for structure and or function Therefore our next approach was to search for such motifs using Block Maker 19 20 It would be ideal to search for motifs with a divergent set of proteins in which the pairwise identities are less than about 40 so that the motifs found are highly conserved because they are important for structure and or function However the high pairwise identities between plant and alpha proteobacterial sequences in group 3 made this impossible Using a query set containing six group 1 sequences seven group 2 sequences seven group 3 sequences and four cyanobacterial sequences Block Maker identified three blocks of conserved sequence Figure 3 A search of the non redundant database using a PSSM position specific scoring matrix generated from these blocks retrieved a total of 81 sequences with E values less than 10 No proteins with identified functions other than GshA were found with E values less than 7 Thus the PSSM was very effective at discriminating between GshA and non GshA sequences in the database Many of the sequences were duplicate entries of a single sequence or sequences from multiple strains of the same organism Taking this into account the search retrieved 44 sequences of known or putative GshAs with E values less than 1 A subset of these sequences representing all three groups and cyanobacteria is shown in Table 2 The p values for each occurrence of the three motifs as well as the E values for each sequence are very low in all three groups These data provide support for a real but distant relationship between the three groups of sequences as well as the cyanobacterial sequences It is difficult to generate reliable phylogenetic trees in cases such as this in which only small blocks of conserved sequence can be identified Figure 4shows a tree generated from the three conserved blocks using the parsimony method in PAUP 4 0b 21 The tree topology supports the findings reported above in that the sequences cluster into three distinct groups with the cyanobacterial sequences being most closely associated with the group 3 plant and alpha proteobacteria sequences The available information does not provide reliable information about the order of branching within each of these groups Similar findings were obtained using the neighbor joining method in PAUP A general association of eukaryotic and alpha proteobacterial sequences that would support the hypothesis that the eukaryotic gene arose by transfer from the mitochondrial progenitor is not seen The striking association of plant sequences with alpha proteobacterial sequences will be addressed below Possible explanations for the distribution of GshA lateral transfer versus massive gene loss Figure 5shows the distribution of known and putative GshA genes mapped onto a universal tree of life generated using rRNA sequences Two possible scenarios could account for the observed pattern of distribution First a GshA gene might have arisen early in either the bacterial or eukaryotic lineage and undergone a lateral transfer to the other domain Alternatively a GshA gene could have been present in the last common ancestor but have been lost in nearly all Archaea the deepest branching eukaryotes and many bacteria Although the possibility of massive loss of GshA at first glance seems unlikely careful perusal of Figures 1and 5reveals that most of the genera that lack GSH and or GshA lack aerobic metabolism and therefore do not need GSH for protection against reactive oxygen species Many Archaea all of the methanogens as well as Archaeoglobus Pyrodictium Thermoproteus and Thermofilum are anaerobes Thermoplasma although facultatively aerobic respires sulfur rather than oxygen The deepest branching eukaryotes Giardia Trichomonas Vairimorpha and Encephalitozoon lack mitochondria and therefore aerobic metabolism Entamoeba histolytica has apparently lost its mitochondria and now lacks aerobic respiratory pathways Bacteria such as Aquifex and Thermotoga are anaerobes Thus the possibility of massive gene loss in these lineages is quite plausible However a problem with this hypothesis is that it requires that the GshA gene which appears to be important only to aerobes must have originated in the last common ancestor before the emergence of O 2 which occurred only after the evolution of cyanobacteria about 2 6 billion years ago 22 The possibility that GshA arose early in the bacterial lineage and then was transferred to the eukaryotic lineage and into at least one archaeon Halobacterium is perhaps more appealing GshA may have arisen in cyanobacteria concomitant with the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis a particularly attractive hypothesis because this would have been the first time protection against reactive oxygen species would have been important Later as proteobacteria developed aerobic metabolic processes that took advantage of the growing O 2 concentration in the atmosphere the consequent production of reactive oxygen species would have given a selective advantage to microbes that acquired a GshA gene by lateral gene transfer from cyanobacteria GshA would have been advantageous to aerobic eukaryotes as well providing selective pressure for the acquisition and retention of a bacterial GshA gene Transfer of a GshA gene from the alpha proteobacterial progenitor of mitochondria as postulated previously 8 11 12 is one possible mechanism for the spread of GshA into eukaryotes Our analysis does not show a significant association between eukaryotic and alpha proteobacterial sequences that would support this mechanism Figure 4 However the extreme divergence of the sequences limits our ability to resolve phylogenetic relationships so this mechanism remains a possibility There are other possible mechanisms for an early trans domain lateral gene transfer as well For example Doolittle has proposed that protists that consume bacteria as food may incorporate bacterial genes into their genomes 23 Lateral transfer of GshA genes Lateral transfer of genes between bacteria is recognized to occur very frequently especially for genes involved in metabolism 24 25 26 Lateral transfers of genes into eukaryotic nuclear DNA from the alpha proteobacterial progenitor of mitochondria and into plant nuclear DNA from the cyanobacterial progenitor of chloroplasts are well documented Only a few other cases of lateral transfers between domains have been reported Examples include transfer of the phosphoglucose isomerase gene from a eukaryote to a bacterium 27 and displacement of several aminoacyl tRNA synthetases in parasitic and symbiotic bacteria by eukaryotic and archaeal counterparts 28 Our results show clear evidence of a trans domain transfer of a GshA gene from alpha proteobacteria to plants Figure 4shows that the data provide 100 bootstrap support to the clustering of plant sequences with the group 3 alpha proteobacterial sequences and Table 3illustrates the strikingly high pairwise sequence identities between plant and alpha proteobacterial sequences Many of the alpha proteobacteria are either plant pathogens for example Agrobacterium tumefaciens or plant commensals for example Sinorhizobium meliloti and Zymomonas mobilis The close physical association between these bacteria and plants apparently provided an opportunity for lateral transfer of the GshA gene perhaps more than 300 million years ago A partial sequence is available for GshA from the conifer Picea abies gi12580873 This sequence has 77 identity to the A thaliana sequence and thus belongs to group 3 Conifers diverged from the lineage leading to flowering plants 300 350 million years ago 29 Thus lateral transfer of the alpha proteobacterial GshA gene may have occurred before the divergence of conifers Additional sequences from other conifers and more primitive plants are needed to pin down the timing of this transfer Lateral gene transfer from alpha proteobacteria to plants is particularly intriguing because transfer and retention of a foreign gene in a sophisticated multicellular organism is more difficult than in bacteria Bacteria can acquire DNA from their environment in multiple ways transformation transduction and conjugation 26 Furthermore a transferred gene can be easily transmitted to progeny after recombination into genomic or plasmid DNA However known mechanisms for transfer of DNA into plants are more limited The best understood mechanism is the transfer of T strand DNA from the Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens into wounded plant tissues a process resulting in the formation of tumors 30 It is not known whether foreign genes can be transferred into plants by this mechanism in nature but such a process is plausible Perpetuation of a transferred gene is also not as easily achieved in seed plants as it is in bacteria because the gene must be incorporated into genomic DNA in apical meristem cells undifferentiated stem cells that produce new organs including the cones or flowers that generate male and female gametes An interesting issue is whether the group 3 alpha proteobacterial gene displaced an ancestral group 2 eukaryotic gene or whether the ancestral gene was first lost allowing the alpha proteobacterial gene to fill the functional gap Additional potential cases of lateral gene transfer are also suggested by our data GshA from Xylella fastidiosa a gamma proteobacterium clusters with group 3 rather than with the other gamma proteobacterial sequences in group 1 This organism is a plant pathogen and its physical association with plants has apparently provided an opportunity for gene transfer either from a plant or more likely from an associated alpha proteobacterium Sequences from Halobacterium sp NRC 1 archaeon Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Streptomyces coelicolor high GC Gram positive bacteria and Streptococcus pneumoniae low GC Gram positive bacterium cluster with the plant and alpha proteobacterial sequences in group 3 and a sequence from Clostridium acetobutylicum a low GC Gram positive bacterium clusters with the gamma proteobacterial sequences in Group 1 Note that synthesis of glutamyl cysteine has been demonstrated in Halobacterium sp NRC 1 31 but not in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Streptomyces coelicolor or Streptococcus pneumoniae The occurrence of GshA homologs in these organisms could reflect persistence of an ancestral GshA in only some genera in the Archaea and in the Gram positive bacteria or could be the result of lateral transfer into a limited number of organisms As discussed above it is difficult to distinguish between these two explanations although the lateral gene transfer hypothesis is most appealing Why are GshA sequences so divergent The three groups of GshA sequences are so divergent that it was difficult to demonstrate an evolutionary relationship between them This level of sequence divergence is unexpected and warrants some thought Three obvious factors contribute to divergence of sequence in orthologs First the organisms being compared may be very distant This explanation is probably not sufficient to explain the sequence divergence in the GshAs The gamma proteobacteria represented in group 1 are reasonably closely related to the alpha proteobacteria in group 3 and the crown eukaryotes in group 2 are reasonably closely related to the plants in group 3 Orthologous relationships between these groups can often be identified Of the 1 923 COGs clusters of orthologous groups 32 33 34 identified in P aeruginosa a gamma proteobacterium 80 are also found in the combined group containing Mesorhizobium loti and Caulobacter crescentus both alpha proteobacteria As a specific example the GshB sequences from E coli a gamma proteobacterium and C crescentus have 41 identity and those from Arabidopsis and human have 43 identity Detection of orthologs in even more distantly related organisms is also possible in many cases We have used PSI BLAST to find orthologs of enzymes that use glutathione including glutaredoxins glutathione S transferases glutathione reductases and glutathione peroxidases in both bacteria and eukaryotes data not shown A second reason that homologous sequences may be very divergent is that little selective pressure has been required to maintain function at the level required for the organism to succeed This situation may occur if the reaction being catalyzed is not very demanding or if the product of the reaction does not contribute to the fitness of the organism in an important way An example of the first scenario is o succinylbenzoate synthase which catalyzes the dehydration of 2 hydroxy 6 succinyl 2 4 cyclohexadiene carboxylate to form o succinylbenzoate synthase in the biosynthetic pathway for menaquinone synthesis o Succinylbenzoate synthases from various organisms have very low pairwise sequence identities compared to those seen for other members of the enolase superfamily The low sequence identities in these enzymes have been interpreted as reflecting relatively low constraints upon the sequence because the reaction is quite facile even in the absence of the enzyme because it forms an aromatic product and thus the enzyme is not required to provide a great deal of assistance 35 This scenario is unlikely to account for the divergence of the GshA genes as formation of a peptide bond is a quite difficult reaction In fact members of the ATP grasp superfamily that catalyze comparable reactions that is GshBs see further below ribosomal S6 modification enzymes D Ala D Ala ligases are sufficiently well conserved to be easily detected by PSI BLAST even though they utilize different substrates 36 With respect to the second scenario it is clear that the ability to synthesize GSH provides a significant advantage Bacteria and yeast that lack functional GshA are viable but are hypersensitive to oxidative damage 37 38 GshA deficient strains of A thaliana are viable but are hypersensitive to cadmium 39 Mice in which Glu Cys ligase has been knocked out die before gestational day 13 40 Thus low selection pressure cannot account for the high levels of divergence among the GshA sequences Finally sequences of homologs may diverge if they are subject to different selective pressures in different lineages This might occur if the protein has a second function a moonlighting function in some lineages and is subject to selective pressure that alters regions of the protein involved in that function Alternatively if a protein interacts with other proteins then differences in those partner proteins will drive changes in the regions of the protein involved in the interaction The possibility that the high level of divergence in GshA proteins is due to one of these factors is intriguing and worth experimental exploration GshB a different story A set of GshBs was assembled by searching the NCBI protein database using either GshB or glutathione synthetase as query words and from the outputs of BLAST searches with the E coli and S cerevisiae proteins as query sequences The sequences in the GshB set fall into two distinct groups corresponding to bacteria and eukaryotes that have no significant relationship to each other on the basis of pairwise sequence identities As seen with GshA PSI BLAST searches with GshB sequences from either group did not find GshB sequences from the other group A PSI BLAST search with the human GshB converged after two iterations The output contained only eukaryotic GshBs a few putative homoglutathione synthestases and a few eukaryotic proteins of unknown function No bacterial GshBs were found in the output After multiple iterations a PSI BLAST search using the E coli GshB gi121663 as an initial query sequence found 509 sequences of enzymes in the ATP grasp superfamily to which the bacterial enzyme is known to belong but no eukaryotic GshB sequences The ATP grasp superfamily 41 includes at least 15 families of enzymes that catalyze formation of a bond between a carboxylate group of one substrate and an amino imino or thiol group of a second substrate The bacterial GshBs are most closely related to ribosomal S6 modification enzymes which catalyze the addition of glutamate to the carboxyl terminus of ribosomal protein S6 Other members of the superfamily include carbamoyl phosphate synthases cyanophycin synthetases and D Ala D Ala ligases Notably many members of the ATP grasp superfamily were found in eukaryotes For example A thaliana has at least three superfamily members in the PSI BLAST output including carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 3 methylcrotonyl CoA carboxylase and acetyl CoA carboxylase However the Arabidopsis GshB is not found in the output Thus ATP grasp superfamily members in eukaryotes are more closely related to bacterial GshBs than to eukaryotic GshBs Crystal structures of GshBs from E coli 42 and human 43 are available so we are able to consider the evolutionary relationship between the two groups of sequences in the context of the structural information Figure 6 The E coli and human enzymes have the same overall structural fold which is typical of the ATP grasp superfamily 36 The human enzyme has a number of insertions and in addition has a circular permutation of the sequence that results in the movement of part of the carboxy terminal domain to the amino terminal domain The sequence identity between the E coli and human enzymes is strikingly low Even in the regions that can be structurally superimposed it is only 10 Furthermore only 2 out of 11 residues involved in binding GSH are conserved between the two enzymes 43 The structural similarity between the E coli and human GshBs indicates that the bacterial and eukaryotic enzymes could be related to each other but is not sufficient to prove that they are related to each other because the common structure might have arisen by convergent evolution from different progenitors This consideration is especially worth noting in light of the very low conservation of residues in the active site Consequently we looked for evidence of an evolutionary relationship by attempting to find proteins that might be distantly related to the bacterial and eukaryotic GshB proteins and therefore might bridge the sequence gap between them using the Shotgun algorithm 44 which was designed to facilitate searches for distant relations between proteins The algorithm performs a BLAST search with each of a set of query sequences It then sorts the hits found by all of the proteins and for each hit identifies the query sequences that found that hit A hit that is found by multiple members of two distinct groups of proteins even with low BLAST scores can be examined closely to determine whether it provides a link between the groups We ran Shotgun with a query set containing six eukaryotic GshBs eight bacterial GshBs eight S6 modification enzymes four from bacteria and four from archaea and four proteins of unknown function three from bacteria and one from the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii Sample outputs are shown in Figure 7 Generally sequences were found by either bacterial GshBs and the S6 modification enzymes or by eukaryotic GshB proteins but not by both groups There was only one exception which was a protein a putative GshB from Medicago truncatula gi 4808539 found by all six of the eukaryotic GshBs with BLAST scores above 194 BLAST probabilities less than 5 2e 31 and one bacterial GshB with a BLAST score of 63 BLAST probability of 1 0 Given the number of bacterial GshB sequences in the query set the finding of one bacterial sequence with an insignificant p value can be regarded as a chance occurrence Thus we were unable to establish any relationship between the two groups of GshB sequences using Shotgun Demonstration of conserved sequence motifs would provide supporting evidence for an evolutionary relationship between eukaryotic and bacterial GshBs In this case the Block Maker algorithm used to analyze the GshA proteins did not perform well This algorithm begins by constructing a ClustalW 45 multiple sequence alignment The circular permutation of the eukaryotic sequences with respect to the bacterial sequences as well as the extremely low sequence identities make alignment difficult and preclude the identification of blocks in the permuted region Therefore a different motif finding algorithm MEME 3 0 46 47 was used to analyze a divergent set of GshBs along with several of the proteins related to the bacterial GshBs Twelve strongly conserved motifs were identified Table 4 The pattern of distribution of these motifs in eukaryotic GshBs bacterial GshBs and S6 modification enzymes the enzymes most closely related to the bacterial GshBs is illustrated in Figure 8 Motifs 11 and 12 are peculiar to the bacterial GshB proteins and map to the substrate binding region of the protein These motifs are replaced by others in the S6 modification enzymes and in D Ala D Ala ligases data not shown while the motifs involved in the ATP binding site 1 4 6 and 5 are conserved This protein scaffold clearly provides a modular structure that is easily adapted to bind different substrates in proximity to bound ATP Two motifs 1 and 5 that contribute to the ATP binding pocket were found in both eukaryotic and bacterial GshBs as well as other members of the ATP grasp super family These motifs were present in different orders in the bacterial and eukaryotic GshBs see Figure 8 because motif 5 is involved in the circular permutation that moves part of the carboxy terminal domain to the amino terminal domain of the eukaryotic enzymes The lack of conserved motifs in the substrate binding region is consistent with the comparison of the E coli and human GshB structures which shows remarkably little similarity in this region of the protein In a case such as this one it can be difficult to determine whether common sequence motifs have arisen by divergence from a common progenitor or by convergent evolution driven by a common function The two common motifs found in the bacterial and eukaryotic GshBs correspond to the ATP binding pocket Thus we examined the possibility that motifs 1 and 5 arose by convergent evolution driven by the need to bind ATP by looking for these motifs in other proteins that bind ATP We searched the non redundant database with motifs 1 and 5 using the MAST algorithm Searches with motif 1 and 5 retrieved 145 and 40 sequences with E values less than 10 respectively Nearly all of the proteins with known functions in the output were GshBs or other members of the ATP grasp superfamily All of the 145 proteins found by motif 1 were members of the ATP grasp superfamily except for two transcriptional regulators with E values of 4 8 gi15613287 and 7 8 gi15224768 dihydroorotate dehydrogenases with E values greater than 7 from several organisms and a proline betaine transporter gi1589297 with an E value of 9 9 All of the proteins with known functions found by motif 5 were members of the ATP grasp superfamily except the LIM containing protein kinase 2t gi3273207 which had an E value of 6 2 Thus motifs 1 and 5 are characteristic of the ATP binding region of the ATP grasp superfamily enzymes The question of whether eukaryotic GshBs are members of the ATP grasp superfamily is difficult to answer with certainty because the eukaryotic GshBs are so dramatically different from the other superfamily members The two conserved sequence motifs involved in ATP binding do provide a link between eukaryotic GshBs and the ATP grasp superfamily but it is rather tenuous as it is possible that these sequences provide the best way to bind ATP within the context of this structural fold and have evolved by convergent evolution in eukaryotic GshBs and the ATP grasp superfamily members The lack of conservation in the glutathione binding region of bacterial and eukaryotic GshBs is also an important consideration We feel that the evidence for a true evolutionary relationship between the eukaryotic GshBs and the ATP grasp superfamily is rather weak given the evidence available at this time For our purposes here it is sufficient to conclude in agreement with Polekhina et al 43 that eukaryotic GshBs did not evolve directly from bacterial GshBs but rather that both evolved from ancestors that had the characteristic fold of the ATP grasp superfamily A different twist A fused GSHA ATP grasp superfamily homolog in an odd collection of bacteria In most organisms GshA and GshB are encoded by separate genes that are not in close proximity An interesting variation on this theme may occur in a small number of bacteria Clostridium perfringens Listeria monocytogenes Listeria innocuans and Pasteurella multocidans have an open reading frame ORF that could encode a GshA homolog fused to an ATP grasp superfamily member raising the possibility that this protein might combine the two activities required for synthesis of GSH C perfringens and L monocytogenes contain low levels of GSH 0 25 mol g residual dry weight that are about 20 fold lower than those found in E coli but it is not known whether they synthesize GSH or simply import it from the medium 4 Experimental determination of the function of these fused proteins is clearly needed The amino terminal part of the fusion proteins is most closely related to group 1 GshAs although the sequence identities are not high Table 5 The carboxy terminal parts of these proteins are most closely related to cyanophycin synthetase which catalyzes the synthesis of a polypeptide storage polymer in cyanobacteria and more distantly related to D Ala D Ala ligase which is involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis in many bacteria These enzymes are members of the ATP grasp superfamily to which GshB also belongs However there is no significant relationship between the carboxy terminal region of these putative fusion proteins and known GshBs see Table 5 If this part of the protein does indeed function as a glutathione synthetase then this would be another example of independent recruitment of an ATP grasp superfamily member to provide this function The occurrence of an ORF for the fusion protein in this cluster of bacteria is curious because C perfringens L monocytogenes and L innocuans are low GC Gram positive bacteria while P multocida is a gamma proteobacterium C perfringens is found in soil and sewage and is often part of the normal intestinal flora of animals and humans It causes gangrene and food poisoning in humans 48 L monocytogenes and L innocuans are ubiquitous contaminants of soil and water and L monocytogenes causes listeriosis a serious food borne illness 48 P multocida colonizes the nasopharynx and gastrointestinal tract of many animals and birds and causes a wide range of illnesses 49 Human infections are most often caused by dog or cat bites Thus the association of these bacteria with animals as either commensal or pathogenic organisms has apparently provided an opportunity for lateral transfer of the gene encoding the fusion protein The ORF for the putative fusion protein in P multocida is particularly intriguing because gamma proteobacteria typically have a group 1 GshA and a typical bacterial GshB P multocida has neither of these and neither does its close relative Haemophilus influenzae The lineage leading to P multocida and H influenzae diverged from other gamma proteobacteria approximately 270 million years ago 50 P multocida and H influenzae have considerably smaller genomes 2 014 and 1 743 predicted coding regions respectively 50 51 than E coli 4 288 predicted coding regions 52 suggesting that this lineage has undergone substantial genome reduction It is possible that the lineage leading to P multocida and H influenzae lost GshA and P multocida subsequently acquired the fused GshA ATP grasp superfamily homolog in its place Putting together the pieces thoughts on the evolution of the pathway The pathway for GSH biosynthesis involves two enzymes and it is of interest to consider which of these evolved first Horowitz has postulated that biosynthetic pathways evolve in a retrograde fashion beginning with the last enzyme in the pathway 53 This hypothesis rests on the assumption that organisms had at one time access to a supply of precursors for biological polymers such as DNA RNA proteins and polysaccharides As the supply of a given precursor dwindled the most successful organisms would be those that invented an enzyme with which to catalyze formation of that precursor from compounds present in the environment Thus there would be continuous selective pressure to add enzymes in the retrograde direction to catalyze synthesis of precursors from ever more simple constituents Evolution of a biosynthetic pathway in the forward direction was deemed unlikely as there would be no selective pressure for evolution of enzymes to produce intermediates of no further use to the organism Horowitz s proposal is logical and appealing There are cases however in which forward evolution of a pathway seems more likely For example many organisms make complex natural products whose roles generally involve killing or manipulating other organisms The pathways for building these complex structures have probably evolved in a forward direction by addition of enzymes capable of adding to the complexity of a pre existing molecule and thereby contributing to its biological potency The GSH biosynthesis pathway is most likely to have evolved in a forward direction If the pathway had evolved in a retrograde direction the Horowitz theory would postulate that GshB arose to take advantage of Glu Cys present in the environment It is unlikely that Glu Cys would have been available because formation of the high energy amide bond would be unlikely to occur abiotically Furthermore this molecule would be unstable to oxidation in aerobic environments However evolution of the GSH biosynthesis pathway in the forward direction makes considerable sense Glu Cys can serve some of the functions of GSH and therefore could be advantageous to an organism even in the absence of GshB Indeed halobacteria contain millimolar levels of Glu Cys but do not convert it further to GSH 2 However Glu Cys is not an ideal solution as it is more easily oxidized than GSH 31 Furthermore the reactivity of a thiol depends upon its pKa as thiolates are orders of magnitude more nucleophilic than thiols 54 The nucleophilicity of the thiol in Glu Cys should be diminished by the proximity of the negatively charged carboxylate Further reaction of Glu Cys with Gly to form GSH would improve its properties with respect to both oxidation and nucleophilicity thus providing selective pressure for evolution of a GSH synthetase GshB One possible source for an enzyme to catalyze the next step in a pathway evolving in the forward direction is the enzyme that catalyzed the last step as this enzyme has a binding site that accommodates the product of the last reaction and that product is the substrate for the next reaction A similar situation occurs for pathways evolving in a retrograde direction This type of enzyme recruitment which takes advantage of already existing substrate specificity determinants but requires changes in catalytic groups appears to occur rather infrequently 55 For example among 510 proteins involved in the small molecule metabolic pathways in E coli homology between consecutive enzymes in a pathway occurs only six times 56 Most often enzymes are recruited to catalyze new reactions by virtue of the catalytic abilities of their active sites and interactions required for substrate binding are then optimized The GSH biosynthesis genes however appear to be an optimal case for recruitment of one enzyme to catalyze a subsequent reaction As GshA has a binding site that accommodates Glu Cys it would appear to be an ideal progenitor of GshB which uses Glu Cys as a substrate and also catalyzes the ATP dependent formation of an amide bond However GshA and GshB appear to be structurally distinct There are no experimental structures for GshAs but recent work suggests that GshAs are homologs of glutamine synthetases 57 GshBs have a different structural fold characteristic of the ATP grasp superfamily Thus the data support a scenario in which emergence of GshA was followed in most organisms by the recruitment of a different protein to serve as the progenitor of GshB It is particularly interesting that in both the bacterial and eukaryotic lineages the ATP grasp structural fold provided the starting point for the evolution of GshB Conclusions Our analysis of the sequences of GshAs and GshBs suggests that the evolutionary history of these proteins is more complex than expected on the basis of the distribution of GSH in extant organisms Our results as well as the observation that GshA and GshB genes are generally not found in proximity in microbial genomes suggest that these genes did not evolve together Therefore we must consider the evolutionary history of the two genes separately Although the origin of the GshA gene cannot be unequivocally determined it is most plausible to suppose that it arose in cyanobacteria which would have been the first cells to require the protection conferred by Glu Cys against reactive oxygen species If this hypothesis is correct then subsequent lateral gene transfers must have occurred to spread the gene to the proteobacteria and eukaryotes as well as to at least one archaeon and possibly to some Gram positive bacteria Because of the high level of sequence divergence there is no clear indication in the sequence data as to whether eukaryotes acquired a GshA gene from a cyanobacterium or a proteobacterium After the acquisition of GshA a further improvement in protection against reactive oxygen species was obtained in most organisms by recruitment of an enzyme to convert Glu Cys to GSH This recruitment apparently took place independently in the bacterial and eukaryotic lineages since the sequence of the eukaryotic GshB is remarkably different from that of the bacterial GshBs despite the structural similarities between these two proteins At least for GshB therefore we can eliminate the possibility of transfer from the mitochondrial progenitor into an early eukaryote The emerging picture of the evolution of the glutathione biosynthesis pathway is significant because it suggests that the pathway evolved in a forward direction in contradiction to the Horowitz hypothesis Materials and methods BLAST 16 and PSI BLAST 16 searches were carried out at the NCBI
