 Sega Dreamcast Ads We ll Never See Unless you re a hardcore gamer you may not know that today saw the debut of Sega s Dreamcast video game console the first 128 bit system ever that means it s really fast and the last hope for a corporation that has gone from having one of the strongest brands in the world to having the words laggard and also ran permanently affixed to its name But even if you haven t noticed Dreamcast before today it s a safe bet that over the next few months the product is going to become inescapable since Sega is in the process of spending tens of millions of dollars on an elaborate marketing campaign that includes among other things sponsoring tonight s MTV Video Music Awards Dreamcast is incidentally quite dazzling and the NFL 2000 game from Sega in particular is the most amazing sports video game ever created But what with even more high powered game systems arriving next year from Sony and Nintendo Sega can t rely on technology alone although word of mouth should help sell a lot of the consoles And so we re getting a sophisticated pseudo grassroots ad campaign with edgy graphics and oblique slogans It s a good campaign but it s not exactly revolutionary That s not surprising since at this point in the history of marketing it seems impossible that you might actually come across something new The irony though is that the TV ads for Dreamcast that Sega has run in Japan where the system was launched last November really are like nothing you ve ever seen before They re self flagellating bitter ads that acknowledge not only Sega s past blunders in the early 1990s Sega was the dominant video game maker but it was crushed by both Sony and Nintendo when the Playstation and N64 systems but also the quixotic nature of the Dreamcast launch The ads star an actual senior managing director of the company a man named Yukawa Hidekazu who looks much like what you imagine Japanese salarymen look like In the first Yukawa eavesdrops on two kids saying Sega video games suck Playstation is much better Melancholy Yukawa heads to a bar gets drunk and on his way home scuffles with some thugs who beat him up The commercial ends with him collapsed in the doorway of his house as an offscreen voice exhorts Come on Mr Yukawa get up In the second ad Yukawa is on a remote mountaintop dressed in a business suit talking to a group of seemingly friendly children who tell him that Sega has changed for the better Really he asks at which point the children s eyes turn black and they scream No it s a joke We don t need Sega we want Playstation The earth then opens beneath Yukawa and swallows him just before he wakes up on the floor of his office to realize that his secretary has caught him daydreaming The ad ends with him reflecting on his nightmare The later ads are slightly more hopeful but the overriding tone which one Sega exec calls this sort of wacky hara kiri approach stays similar That tone has made Yukawa a cult hero He s recorded a hit single a love song to the Dreamcast and Sega printed up a limited edition of six phone cards with his image on them At a games conference in October people lined up for hours to have their pictures taken with him Most improbable of all the Dreamcast box in Japan features a photo of Yukawa san looking somehow anxious and yet charming Although the Yukawa ads are startling they make sense in the context of the Japanese veneration of what scholar Ivan Morris famously called the nobility of failure as well as what Moore calls their emphasis on culpability and accountability As such they throw into sharp relief the differences between the Japanese market and the U S market and point up a basic problem faced by a company like Sega of America This is an American subsidiary of a Japanese company trying to target a market different from the one in which its parents are rooted In other words no Yukawa ads for us
