                            As a student I always marvelled at the sight of single cells in culture moving over        artificial surfaces and exhibiting membrane ruffles and protrusions However while I found        cultured cells fascinating I always wondered how cells are able to move and regulate their        shape in the context of a whole organism where so many space constraints exist and where        all cellular processes have to be tightly regulated Some answers to my questions began to        emerge in a paper written by Baum and Perrimon  in which the authors showed the        expression and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and of actin binding proteins in a real        epithelium        The cytoskeleton is a meshwork of protein polymers extending throughout the cytoplasm        It not only provides structural support for the cell but also plays a central role in a        range of dynamic processes from signalling to endocytosis and intracellular trafficking A        particularly clear example of this is the use of actin cytoskeleton as a wool for        knitting multiple dynamic structures such as lamellae filopodia and stress fibres These        structures determine cell shape and also produce the driving force accompanying many types        of cellular movements including muscle contraction and cell division We know many details        about some of the proteins that modulate the dynamics of actin in these structures        However most of them have been found biochemically and their function has been elucidated        primarily using in vitro and cell culture assays of actin assembly What about these        proteins in the context of a developing organism How do cells generate a spatially and        temporally ordered network of actin filaments represented at the tissue level To answer        these questions we need to move to experimentally accessible multicellular organisms such        as         Drosophila  which offers virtually unlimited possibilities as a        model system for the genetic and molecular analysis of biological processes        Baum and Perrimon  analyzed the function of a number of proteins involved in actin        dynamics within the context of a developing epitheliumthe follicle cells that surround the        germ line cyst during         Drosophila oogenesis These cells have a simple polarised        arrangement of actin filaments which provides a useful system to study the spatial        organisation of the actin cytoskeleton        Taking advantage of the ability to generate clones of cells lacking specific proteins        the authors identified new functional roles for actin regulators such as CAP a         Drosophila homologue of adenylyl cyclaseassociated proteins        Enabled Ena and Abelson Abl These proteins had been well characterized in cell culture        and in vitro studies but little was known about their function in a developing organism        Clones of cells lacking CAP Figure  a protein known to inhibit actin polymerisation        maintained their epithelial polarity but had higher levels of actin and defects in the        apical actin organisation This result indicates that the inhibitory activity of CAP is        restricted to one side of the cells thus demonstrating that actin dynamics can be        independently modified at opposite poles of an epithelium Ena a member of the EnaVASP        family proteins that catalyse filament formation and Abl a protein kinase that binds CAP        in mammalian cells were found to work with CAP in this process The authors proposed that        CAP Ena and Abl regulate the level and spatial organization of actin in the follicle        cells        In contrast to the spatially restricted functions of CAP Ena and Abl profilin and        cofilin were shown to regulate actin filament formation throughout the cell cortex a more        global function that matches the results obtained in cell culture experiments In summary        this study showed how proteins can organise actin in space and began to highlight some of        the differences and similarities between cells in culture and in vivo The functions        revealed in the follicular epithelium were consistent with the roles previously shown in        mammalian systems but the experiments on intact tissue began to reveal a spatial and        temporal functional dimension that could not have been observed in cell culture        These experiments could be expanded to largescale screens St Johnston  but this        would be time consuming and could encounter the problem that some genes will be cell        lethal preventing the analysis of their function in actin dynamics However two more        recent reports Kiger et al  Rogers et al  describe a complementary and        exhaustive search for regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics by taking advantage of genomic        resources and the powerful RNA interference RNAi technique Hutvgner and Zamore         RNAi allows individual genes to be knocked out in a simple and controlled fashion        Kiger et al  used RNAi in two different cell lines of         Drosophila to screen a number of genes involved in signalling        and cytoskeletal dynamics They targeted  genes of which  produced phenotypes in the        experiment The range of phenotypes varied from specific defects in the actin and tubulin        cytoskeleton to others affecting cell cycle progression cytokinesis and cell shape They        also showed that only about  of the genes had similar lossoffunction phenotypes in        both cell lines This alone indicates an important limitation of many tissue culture        experiments since the same protein can have different effects depending on the cell type        Another valuable element of this work is that clustering of genes with similar phenotypes        leads to the identification of pathways and networks of genes that are involved in        cytoskeletal function        Rogers et al  using only one         Drosophila cell line studied the effects of proteins involved        in the formation of lamellae The authors looked at the effects of loss of function in         genes known to be involved in actin dynamics and the formation and activity of the lamella        As well as confirming the function of many proteins already known to play a role in this        process this analysis allowed them to find interactions between genes and to build genetic        pathways        Together these two studies reveal that RNAi screens in tissue culture can be a powerful        tool for finding new functions of known and uncharacterized genes and new relationships        between genes However this is only the beginning and the genes identified in this manner        will have to be tested in vivo in systems like that of Baum and Perrimon where specific        functions can be assessed in time and space within the confines of real organisms The        focus must be to understand how all these molecular events and regulation cascades operate        in individual cells to contribute to the generation of changes in a whole individual        Increasingly the attention of developmental biologists is being drawn from genes and their        products towards cells Kaltschmidt and Martinez Arias  The future it seems to me        lies in the combination of in vitro systems cell culture and in vivo studies I hope to        apply this view in my analysis of the process of dorsal closure in         Drosophila embryos as an example of how signalling pathways        coordinate and regulate the activity of the cytoskeleton in the generation of shape and        morphogenetic movements Jacinto et al
