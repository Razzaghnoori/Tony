 where do you get most of your current events oh well when the war was on i was watching the T V a lot uh huh but um i haven t been doing it so much now that it s calmed down yeah yeah i was i was uh we don t have cable so we were watching C N N a lot and then trying to switch thank goodness for remote control uh huh yeah we were switching from one station to another and in between keeping the radio on yeah C N N coverage was really good it was extraordinary yeah we um um and then you know couldn t wait for the newspaper reminded me of when i was younger the uh the time of Watergate and just couldn t get enough of it yeah yeah but uh it kind of get wrapped up in it yeah um i it was the first couple of nights sitting up and watching T V late into the evening and you just wanted to get the latest news what was happening yeah kind of like watching the Olympics huh kind of like watching the Olympics yeah yeah you just couldn t you couldn t put it down you couldn t put it down yeah after a while though it started getting a little repetitive it ran out of news it did yeah it was like you know that what was it two steps forward one step back yeah and uh but occasionally you know you d stay in tune just long enough to get the latest different tidbit or a different angle and uh you really became addicted to it for a while right right do you uh normally read the newspaper every day i try to um the newspaper comes uh in the morning and i leave for work at seven huh yeah yeah and i usually don t get a chance to sit down until after work the what the Post pretty good newspaper uh huh and at that point i try at least try to get through most most the front section and maybe you know one or two other sections yeah i don t i don t regularly watch news or uh newspaper i would say i get probably most of it from my friends you know they finally told me hey there s a war going on oh okay uh huh where do what what newspaper do you get uh there uh just the Raleigh local paper how does it how does compare have you can you compare like how does it compare to the Post oh it s it s it s not even a comparison yeah that s funny because every once in a while if my husband and i have traveled or something um and we pick up a local paper we re really shocked even in a major city at how local it is it s really provincial yeah yeah the news is the same way the news local news here is kind of lousy is it really i mean it s not much different than when i lived in Roanoke Virginia which is really small town that s that s maybe because we get so you know we re so jaded with the Post uh yeah which is really international and and it keeps reminding me you know that this we re we re really in an in an isolated different situation here and i keep saying no wonder the rest of the people in the world vote for in the country vote the way they do i mean yeah that explains it but uh i probably do watch more T V because i get home and in between say cooking dinner or something if i can catch a five or six o clock news right right i watch that usually uh before we settle down uh depending what time we get to bed we ll usually watch the ten or the eleven o clock news we have a ten o clock news here at night and that s ideal uh huh um yeah because because by ten thirty i start to fade so uh i m in graduate school so i have a really weird schedule and i don t know i really don t have time for T V and newspaper just i wouldn t i wouldn t have time to read it so i m what are you studying like yeah i remember when i was in school yeah finding the latest thing out from my friends is usually the most uh time effective yeah yeah no i can remember way back back in those days when i was in school the i think the only time we only really watched the news and this tells you how old i was was during the Cuban missile crisis yeah uh i we could just we were all centered around that television yep what s neat is seeing history happen you know that s exactly right and i d i guess that s it yeah although i do worry that how easy this one was might be a bad lesson uh to the to the younger people um you know than there is the other generation yeah um in North Carolina there was a lot lot of service men from here you know and people really saw that oh that s true yeah yeah saw it first hand that was probably the best part of the news was the uh some of the person human interest stories yeah some of it got a little i i don t know i thought it was a little too personal that they were digging each other life uh huh yeah yeah little too much maybe does it does it bother you that uh at this point in your life that you re not getting more direct news or uh no not really what are you studying i m in computer science okay yeah um i guess i see it as information age yeah how old are you i m twenty five okay then i m see i m about twenty years older yeah and i really do i do rely i do miss it i do rely on the news and uh i i guess i regret i don t get enough local really local we get some local papers but i guess i m more interested in the national or international news uh huh it s almost getting to the point where there is there s too much that overload news overload yeah you shouldn t even worry about most of the stuff i mean i don t know it s a little near sighted but uh yeah but well it s hard i ll i ll tell you though it is hard when you go to vote i mean there are so many issues and there re so many people running that you know unless you have some way of evaluating it yeah yeah and i guess the news does help well it was really nice talking talking to you okay okay did it work out your first time all right i hope so okay alright bye bye take care bye bye
