 The Muteness of Prince George Gov George W Bush R Texas announced Sunday that he is forming a committee to explore whether he should run for president After a parade of adulatory speeches from committee members he fielded questions One reporter asked whether abortion should be illegal in the first trimester That s a hypothetical question said Bush What about global economic instability I won t have specific remedies or specific suggestions until I start moving around the country Bush replied Should we build a missile defense system even if it violates the anti ballistic missile treaty I will be glad to answer all those questions once I get out in the course of the campaign Bush offered ending the press conference What a charade Bush s campaign has been underway for a year He has plotted strategy assembled a campaign team pitched to donors courted politicians and written letters to potential allies in key states His fund raisers expect to collect 10 million by the end of March For the next three months his exploratory committee will raise money and build a campaign staff Yet Bush remains clueless about many national issues and on others he knows he can only lose votes by being pinned down Moreover the longer he postpones his candidacy the longer he deprives his rivals of a target thereby starving them to death For these reasons Bush is claiming immunity to policy questions And he s getting away with it thanks to several excuses 1 I m doing my job At his press conference Bush refused to answer questions about tax cuts and other issues until Texas finishes its legislative session in May He explained that being governor is his job and that he had promised Texans he would stay home through the session I m a person who does in office what I say I will do he insisted Former GOP Chairman Haley Barbour a member of the exploratory committee seemed deeply moved I think Gov Bush s keeping his commitment to Texas shows what kind of leader George Bush is said Barbour Lest anyone contemplate the convenience of this excuse Bush spun it as a sacrifice He regretted that he wouldn t be able to visit key primary states for months Some have said Well you re gonna be too late in some state he lamented But I ve got a job to do The press swallowed this line whole Bush is understandably reluctant to leave Austin at least until the Legislature concludes its work said U S News World Report He has defied conventional wisdom by refusing to travel the country to raise money and court supporters 2 Read my principles Bush outlined his core conservative principles limited government low taxes free and fair trade local control of schools strong families and personal responsibility When asked about specific issues he referred back to his principles How exactly do you plan to preserve the prosperity of the United States asked one reporter When I start to emerge out of the state after the legislative session said Bush I m going to lay out an economic stimulus package that will do just that You heard the principles by which I ll be making decisions On foreign policy he said only that his framework would emphasize what s good for America 3 Read my testimonials To deflect scrutiny from his own views Bush stacked his committee with people who can vouch for him At the press conference President Reagan s secretary of state George Shultz and President Bush s national security aide Condoleeza Rice vouched for Gov Bush s toughness on foreign policy Reps J C Watts Jr R Okla and Henry Bonilla R Texas vouched for his racial inclusiveness Pro choice Rep Jennifer Dunn R Wash vouched for his belief in individual freedom When a reporter asked what Bush would do about Russia s meltdown Bush cited his principles babbled about missile defense and said I of course will be relying upon the briefings on details from people such as Dr Rice With friends like these who needs positions He has George Shultz advising him on foreign policy observed ABC s George Will with delight Bush s personnel moves serve him particularly well on social issues He has conspicuously courted former Christian Coalition executive director Ralph Reed and in January he made a pilgrimage to coalition founder Pat Robertson Without publicly embracing any of the coalition s positions Bush elicited from Robertson the magic words He loves the Lord Conservative pundits are particularly excited over Bush s recruitment of conservative Christian speech writer Mike Gerson Noting that Gerson wrote Bob Dole s anti Hollywood speech in 1996 Fred Barnes inferred on Meet the Press that one issue on which we re going to hear a lot from Bush is cultural conservatism 4 Read my polls Since Bush s advantages lie in politics rather than policy he steers attention to his campaign juggernaut rather than to his platform The men and women on this stage represent the best of the Republican Party he boasted at his press conference Rep Roy Blunt R Mo handed Bush a list of 80 current members of Congress who have already endorsed your candidacy and Bush s aides distributed a similar list to reporters On the weekend chat shows pundits marveled at Bush s deluge of endorsements his bottomless coffers and his godlike standing in the polls Bush never explicitly brings up money or polls because he doesn t have to But he counts on them to keep the press pining for him while he stiffs policy questions 5 Shame on you When pressured to clarify his positions Bush morphs the question into attack politics and attack journalism I will campaign on my beliefs and my principles and I will not engage in the petty politics of personal destruction he insisted A reporter asked him about conservative opponents who associate him with his father s moderation I m going to try to work hard not to play the typical political game of tearing down your opponent Bush sniffed and I would hope others wouldn t tear down my dad Bush s wife and daughters provide another handy shield I had doubts and concerns about what a campaign would mean for my family he confided to the assembled scribes I convinced my wife that I love her and I ll always love her That s the only thing that ll overcome the meat grinding aspects of national politics From the podium Dunn and Rice two of the committee s three front women implored Bush s wife and daughters to endure the campaign s trial by fire Bush has milked this protective anguish for months Never mind that according to Time he privately told several financial backers in January I love my wife And I love my daughters But they don t have a veto on this Bush s portrayal of substantive interrogation as nasty nit picking has completely suckered the media Time reported that his rivals were trying to pose litmus test questions and tear Bush down U S News accused them of picking at his credentials and warned Bush will accept only so much battering Quoting a Pat Buchanan adviser s demand that Bush take some positions on abortion taxes China homosexual rights U S News groaned that Buchanan seems poised for another round of bashing the front runner On Meet the Press Lamar Alexander said of Bush s vagueness We need to define what we mean Are we for a single rate flat tax Or are we as I am for tripling the tax deduction for each child to 8 000 Are we for affirmative action based on need as I am or based on race Are we for English for the children on the first day of school or are we for federal bilingual education programs I m arguing for plain talk not weasel words To which host Tim Russert replied Why won t you abide by the 11 th Amendment and stop criticizing George W Bush Meanwhile Bush suffers in silence as his fund raisers bleed the field dry I ll play the hand I was dealt he shrugs stoically Poor George He can t help it He was born with a silver gag in his mouth
