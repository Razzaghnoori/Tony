 Strokes of Luck The Washington Post and New York Times lead with the British government s finding based on an independent medical examination that Gen Augusto Pinochet under house arrest in England is too sick to be tried on the human rights charges awaiting him in Spain This means say the papers that Pinochet could instead return to Chile soon The USA Today final edition leads with a saber rattling leak from the DOJ Microsoft wrangle that government prosecutors will shortly offer up during negotiations with Microsoft a proposal for a breakup yielding two companies one for the Windows operating system another for software programs The story says that it s unclear where Microsoft Internet activities would go A Microsoft spokesman is quoted saying a breakup would do great harm to the industry The top non local story at the Los Angeles Times which fronts Pinochet is the Supreme Court s ruling Tuesday saying the nation s state workers including teachers do not enjoy the federal government s protection against age discrimination yet another example says the paper of the court s recent championing of states rights The NYT fronts the decision The Wall Street Journal runs Pinochet and the court one two at the top of its front page news box The papers say that a decision to allow Pinochet who was found to have suffered a series of small strokes to return to Chile is in the hands of the home secretary and may come next week The WP and LAT report that Pinochet still may face charges back in Chile The Post adds that although Pinochet was granted legal immunity in Chile in return for his step down from power it s not clear that the current government is willing to honor it On the other hand the NYT reminds that while he s been in England Pinochet has received the support of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher who it says was delighted with the doctors report The WP reports that Spain and even many human rights advocates will accept Pinochet s escape of the Spanish charges because as all the papers note the case has via the British courts created a historic precedent A former head of state can be brought to trial in another country for crimes against humanity committed in his home country while in office The WP off leads yesterday s 11 percent drop off in AOL s stock price significant notes the paper because AOL plans to purchase Time Warner with its stock USAT fronts the latest wrinkle in the Eli n Gonz lez saga It seems that the Miami family court judge who just delayed the INS plan to return the boy to his father in Cuba employed during her 1998 election campaign the spokesman for the boy s Miami relatives as well as the spokesman s wife The numbers vary a bit from paper to paper but ballpark the two received a total of 60 000 The stories say the Miami court does not require judges in this sort of situation to recuse themselves The NYT fronts an Alex Kuczynski effort reporting a surprising image manipulation at CBS News It seems that the network s evening news broadcast for Dec 30 and Dec 31 included images of Times Square with a billboard advertising CBS News But the billboard and the CBS ad are not actually in Times Square They were digitally inserted by CBS into the shot The story says the anchor on the show Dan Rather learned about the practice during the broadcast but did not protest Rather did not return a phone call from the Times By the way journalists who don t return phone calls from the press are precisely the sorts who don t hesitate to manipulate content it s all part of the belief that the rules they constantly apply to others don t apply to themselves The WP s Reliable Source says Hillary Clinton will appear on Letterman tonight Maybe the network can digitally give her a prayer in New York On the WP op ed page Cindy Williams an MIT researcher does a good nuts and boltsy job of bringing some reality to the topic of military pay raises The author notes that the alleged gap of 13 percent between civilian and military pay fails to take into account allowances for food and housing Also she notes that some of the allowances are not taxed Such details help to explain why soldiers typically earn more money than 75 percent of civilians with similar backgrounds And there are some concrete earnings examples a Marine master sergeant with 20 years in makes more than 50 000 better than a senior firefighter or police officer and both of those civilian jobs are as dangerous or more so than the typical military job And a colonel with 26 years service makes more than 108 000 And none of this includes the op ed notes re enlistment and other special bonuses The one point the author leaves out that would make her argument even stronger the very young retirement ages available to military personnel That colonel for instance can retire on a nice pension at age 47 In a letter to the NYT a working mother explains how her household handles her child s homework First ask the babysitter for help if that fails try Mom s fax if she s not traveling to close a deal if that fails try Dad s fax if he s not in court and if all of the above fail call Grandma Ro No fax available
