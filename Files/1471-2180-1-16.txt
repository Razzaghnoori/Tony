 Introduction Iron is one of the essential nutrients required by the bacteria to be able to multiply and invade a vertebrate host However as a defense mechanism availability of iron for the bacteria is limited in the host as most of it complexed to ferritin transferrin hemoglobin heme and hemosiderin 1 2 3 4 For pathogenic bacteria to be able to establish an infection it must compete with and obtain iron from the host s iron binding protein 5 The bacteria have evolved a number of diverse mechanisms utilize the host iron One of the methods of achieving this is by secretion of low molecular weight high affinity iron chelators termed siderophores and their specific cell surface receptor Iron Regulated Outer Membrane Proteins IROMPs These receptors are expressed under iron restricted conditions 6 7 8 9 The role of IROMPs in iron uptake have been reported for other bacteria like Escherichia coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria gonorrheae Antibodies directed against these proteins associated with iron uptake exert a bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect by blocking siderophore mediated iron uptake pathways 10 11 12 13 14 A baumannii is widely recognized as an emerging nosocomial pathogen and is of particular concern due to the spread of multi drug resistant strain 15 16 A baumannii has also been shown to produce siderophores and expresses IROMPs under iron restricted conditions 17 18 Smith and Alpar had shown the specific antibody response to IROMPs in patients suffering from A calcoaceticus septicemia in the convalescent sera 19 We carried out the present study to characterize the IROMPs A baumannii ATCC 19606 by producing monoclonal antibodies against them Western blot analysis was performed to study their specificity These monoclonal antibodies were tested for their in vitro bactericidal activity and opsonizing activity Apart from this their role in blocking the siderophore mediated iron uptake system was also studied Results Expression of IROMPs and effect of Iron on growth OMP profiles of A baumannii grown in CDM Fe and CDM Fe were compared on SDS PAGE and it was seen that in absence of iron bacteria developed 4 new outer membrane proteins which were absent in iron replete conditions These new proteins are in the range of 77 kDa to 88 kDa and were the IROMPs Fig 1 Monoclonal antibody production Five best reactive monoclonal antibodies were selected out of 88 clones after 2 fusions based upon their reactivity to IROMPs by ELISA These monoclonal antibodies were named as 3D 5 ABIR 1D 11 ABIR 2G 9 ABIR 1F 7 ABIR and 5D 6 ABIR All of the five monoclonal antibodies were of IgM isotypes Table 1 These monoclonal antibodies were tested in Western blots Fig 2shows the results of western immunoblots of OMPs All the monoclonal antibodies reacted with one or more OMP bands corresponding to the range of IROMPs but none reacted with the OMPs of bacteria grown in CDM Fe media Two antibodies 5D 6 ABIR and 1F 7 ABIR did not show any reactivity on Western blot this may be due to conformational changes of epitope of proteins All of the antibodies were tested against E coli and Pseudomonas aerugionsa and none of them were cross reactive with IROMPs of these two bacteria on ELISA Characterization of monoclonal antibodies Bactericidal activity All these monoclonal antibodies were tested for their bactericidal activity against A baumannii ATCC 19606 in vitro It was found that all the five monoclonal antibodies are bactericidal and they specifically kill the bacteria grown in CDM Fe media The of reduction or killing was 80 90 and various controls gave 10 20 reduction in bacterial colony Table 2 Opsonising activity It was found that human PMNs opsonize bacteria more readily when bacteria is preincubated with monoclonal antibodies as is evident by counting the bacteria within the PMNs Table 2 as compared to controls The opsonization activity of PMNs was increased 6 8 folds by prior incubation with monoclonal antibodies Uptake of Iron through siderophore The siderophore was secreted by Acinetobacter buamnnii ATCC 19606 was catechole type as determined by Arnow s method The uptake of radiolabeled iron siderophore complex by the bacterial whole cells in CDM Fe was significantly more than that in case of bacterial cells obtained from CDM Fe medium Fig 3 The control tubes incubated only with 55Fe without siderophore showed negligible iron uptake Total radioactivity bound to the filter in case of iron deficient bacteria with radioactive siderophore complex was about 85 out of the 100 radioactivity taken of the neat 55Fe In control as well as with iron rich bacteria it was not more than 15 25 This suggests that the iron uptake is mediated through siderophore The data was analyzed by nonparametric Willcoxan Rank Sum Test for two groups It was found that iron uptake by iron deficient cells was significantly more as compared to iron rich cells p value 0 05 Similarly there was a significant difference in CPM reading of iron deficient cells for uptake through siderophore p value 0 05 as compared to the control cells in which no siderophore was added Binding of 59Fe Siderophore complex to OMP The outer membrane proteins prepared from cells grown in the absence of iron bound significantly higher amount of radioactive iron siderophore complex as compared to that of the OMP prepared from cells grown in iron rich conditions p value 0 05 Similarly there was no binding of radiolabeled 59Fe alone to the filters in absence of siderophore which was put up as control This strongly indicates that OMP of CDM Fe grown bacteria contains the IROMPs and that they bind to the iron siderophore complex hence they may be the receptor for siderophore iron complex Fig 4 That binding receptor a protein was proved by preincubating the OMPs with proteinase K that abolished all the binding activity of the iron siderophore complex Fig 4 Role of monoclonal antibody in Iron pathway The iron uptake by A baumannii ATCC 19606 when grown in CDM Fe was inhibited more than 90 by monoclonal antibodies directed against IROMPs of A bauamannii as compared to bacteria grown in CDM Fe Fig 5 p value 0 05 Similarly monoclonal antibodies resulted in almost complete inhibition of binding of 55Fe siderophore complex to its receptor IROMPs which are the component of OMPs p value 0 05 But there was no effect on binding and uptake of iron siderophore complex in absence of monoclonal antibodies or with control sera Fig 5 Discussion Iron is an important nutritional requirement of living cells Iron is not readily available to the microbes which invades the human hosts 20 as a part of host defense mechanism against bacterial infections In iron starved conditions bacterial growth rate is reduced and morphological changes such as filament formation takes place which suggests an inhibition of DNA synthesis or cell division 21 22 Besides these the concentration of the proteins whose synthesis is regulated by iron are also observed to get changed 23 To acquire the iron essential for their growth and metabolism the microbes have evolved the ability to compete with host iron binding factors This is achieved by producing powerful iron chelators known as siderophores 24 25 26 27 Siderophores are secreted in the external melieu where they compete with host iron binding proteins to capture iron by forming iron siderophore complex This gets internalized through the specific outer membrane protein receptors termed as Iron Regulated Outer Membrane Proteins IROMPs We found that when A baumannii was grown in iron deficient medium IROMPs were expressed on their outer membranes with molecular weight of 88 84 80 and 77 kDa We also found that A baumannii secreted catehcol type of siderophore in the external melieu Daniel et al 28 also reported the production of IROMPs and siderophore during different phase of growth cycle in iron starved medium by A baumannii The molecular weight of these proteins described by them were in between 70 80 kDa of these 75 and 80 kDa are expressed more strongly in iron repressed bacteria They have also cloned and characterized the fur regulator gene of the IROMPs Apart from these some other high molecular weight IROMPs in Acinetobacter have also been identified by Echenique et al on SDS PAGE 29 Smith and Alpar also demonstrated the reactivity by immunoblotting against the IROMPs using the sera of convalescent patients recovering from Acinetobacter infection sera by Smith and Alpar 18 In order to further characterize the biological properties of IROMPs and role of the antibodies produced against them we raised monoclonal antibodies to the IROMPs by hybridoma technology The five best reactive and specific clones which were selected after subcloning belonged to IgM class On western blot however only 3 clones reacted with the bands corresponding to IROMPs The reason for none of the clones reacting could be due to the fact that monoclonal antibodies recognize only an epitope whose tertiary structure might be changed during denaturation conditions of SDS PAGE The anti IROMPs antibodies showed significant in vitro bactericidal activity against A baumannii grown in absence of iron Also being IgM subtype these were efficient in complement mediated lysis of bacteria They also enhanced the phagocytosis of A baumannii 6 8 folds more as compared to preimmune sera of mice in invitro experiments These results showed that the IROMPs are surfaced exposed immunodominant antigens which play significant role in virulence Earlier also the antibodies against 70 kDa IROMPs of Neisseria meningitidis have been shown to be bactericidal 9 These antibodies may have a role as protective antibodies in the course of infection inside a human host The antisera against Tbp1 and Tbp2 killed the homologous as well as majority of heterologous strains examined with varying efficiency 30 Sokol and Woods 31 have pointed out that the antibodies against pyoverdin and pyochelin receptor proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa enhances the opsonization process by polymorphonucleocytes They have also shown that these antibodies were protective in a burn mouse model system We observed that these antibodies significantly reduced the uptake of iron by A baumannii cells Meyer et al 11 and Pintor et al 13 14 have shown the specific block of iron uptake via siderophore and transferrin using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against IROMPs of Pseudomona sp and Neisseria sp respectively We also observed that the antibodies raised against the IROMPs of A baumannii also inhibited the binding of iron siderophore complex to purified OMPs The blocking in the uptake of iron resulted ultimately in the growth inhibition of the bacterium This mechanism of iron uptake may constitute an important virulence factor which can help in establishing infection in the host 26 The study of this virulence system may help in the better understanding of the bacterial pathogenesis especially in an opportunistic pathogen like Acinetobacter sp Materials and Methods Bacterial strains and growth conditions The Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606 strain was procured from American Type Cell Culture USA It was grown in Iron depleted chemically defined media CDM Fe and in iron rich CDM Fe media Outer membrane

phagocytosed bacteria Blocking of iron uptake by bacteria For studying the role of monoclonal antibodies in blocking of iron uptake pathway we purified the siderophore by a modified method of Smith 17 Briefly the culture supernatant of bacteria grown in CDM Fe medium was extracted twice with ethyl acetate The ethyl acetate was reduced to 0 5 ml by rotary evaporation Buchi rotary evaporator at 30 C under reduced pressure This sample was loaded on Whatman 3 mm chromatography paper and developed using solvent system of water Acetic Acid Acetone in ratio of 90 10 1 One portion of the chromatogram was stained with 0 1 M FeCl 3 in 0 1 M HCl The corresponding band was excised and siderophore was eluted in ethyl acetate for 48 hrs at room temperature After evaporation of ethyl acetate purified siderophore was re suspended in distilled water and stored at 80 C The type of siderophore was determined by Arnow s 41 and Csaky s method 42 The concentration of siderophore was determined using 2 3 dihydroxybenzoic acid as a standard by Universal Chemical assay as described by Schwyn s 43 2 mM of 50 l purified siderophore was incubated with either 10 M 55FeCl 3 specific activity 2 068 Mci g of

minutes At the end the unbound radiolabelled iron was removed by chromatography using sephadex G 10 as described by Rosenberg 44 The uptake of radiolabelled iron siderophore was studied by the method described by Rosenberg 44 Briefly A baumannii was grown in CDM Fe medium also in CDM Fe medium to a mid exponential phase and was washed twice with uptake medium 30 mM Na 2 HPO 4 10 mM K 2 HPO 4 10 mM NH 4 2 SO 4 1 mM MgCl 2 and 40 M CaCl 2 pH 6 9 at 4 C and re suspended in the same medium at a density of A 470 0 4 The washed cells were incubated at 37 C for 15 minutes The uptake was initiated by adding equal volume of radiolabelled 55Fe siderophore to the bacterial suspension and shaken at 300 rpm Aliquots of 500 l were withdrawn after every 5 minutes interval and filtered immediately on glass microfiber filter and washed with 2 ml of uptake medium The membranes were dried at 37 C and measured as counts per minutes on scintillation counter Pharmacia on the 3H channel In parallel bacterial cells were also incubated with radiolabelled iron alone and unlabelled siderophore as a control To look for the role of monoclonal antibodies against IROMPs in blocking the iron uptake the bacterial cells were pre incubated with 100 l of undiluted monoclonal antibody culture supernatant for 1 h at 37 C before addition of radiolabelled iron siderophore complex After incubation with antibodies the bacterial cells were washed twice with uptake buffer to remove unbound antibodies Similarly as like in uptake radioactivity retained on the filter was counted on scintillation counter on 3H channel Binding of radiolabelled iron siderophore complex to OMPs Binding of radiolabelled 55Fe siderophore complex to OMPs was carried out as described by Meyer et al 11 100 g of OMPs in 0 125 M Tris HCl pH 6 8 was mixed with 0 1 ml of siderophore labeled with 55Fe as described above The total volume of the mixture was adjusted to 1 ml with uptake medium and the reaction mixture were incubated for 10 minutes at 37 C This was filtered through 0 22 m filter and washed twice with 2 ml of uptake medium The radiolabeled iron retained on the filter was counted as counts per minutes on scintillation counter on 3H channel To determine the nature of the binding receptor the OMP preparation was subjected to digestion with proteinase K 10 mg ml for 1 hr at 37 C prior to the incubation with iron siderophore complex To test the blocking of iron siderophore to OMP s it was preincubated with monoclonal antibodies for 1 h at 37 C as described in uptake experiment and then binding assay was performed
