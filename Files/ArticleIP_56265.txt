 Regis Philbin The hottest celebrity in America is a TV star with no discernible talent who is 66 years old that s 462 in TV years whose partner is the most detested woman on television and whose claims to fame are an evening game show that no one wins Who Wants To Be a Millionaire and a morning talk show where nothing happens Live With Regis Kathie Lee Yet Regis Philbin deserves all his acclaim and more Regis has not come from nowhere He has come from everywhere Until he hit big with Live in the late 80s he was the quintessential loser a 25 year also ran A Notre Dame grad and Navy veteran he got his start in the early 60s hosting a talk show in San Diego Calif and spent the next quarter century anchoring shows in New York St Louis and Los Angeles Periodically these stints would be interrupted by a shot at the big time which Regis would invariably blow In 1964 he succeeded Steve Allen as host of Westinghouse s marquee late night show It flopped and Philbin was dumped for Merv Griffin In the late 60s Philbin spent three years as Joey Bishop s sidekick on another doomed late night show Johnny Carson s Tonight Show spanked Bishop in the ratings In the mid 70s Philbin bombed as host of a couple of game shows In 1981 he tanked as anchor of a national morning program No one could explain why Regis didn t work He was too spastic perhaps just a nerve ending as Bill Zehme who co wrote Philbin s delightful autobiography puts it Regis returned to New York in 1983 took over a morning show hooked up with Kathie Lee Gifford then Kathie Lee Johnson two years later and went national with the show in 1988 Live has been a monster hit ever since Regis and Kathie Lee quickly became figures of ridicule the embodiment of unhip He was the toothy moron she the unbearable crooner Live sounds like a joke an hour of nothing 20 minutes of host chat between Regis and Kathie Lee celebrity interviews lame stunts a trivia question Watch it once and it seems pathetic Watch it twice and you begin to see genius As host of Live or Millionaire or anything else he has ever done Regis displays no evident talent He does not interview guests well He does not tell jokes He lacks empathy He displays no particular intelligence He speaks in a bizarre voice equal parts Bronx sinus and helium So why is he the most watchable person on television In the autobiography I m Only One Man he explains his success this way I started small and learned to keep it small Small is friendlier and more real Small lasts longer This captures one of Regis gifts He has a modest but captivating comic persona He is the master of umbrage Walloped by a generation of rejection failure and sidekickdom he has perfected the persona of the aggrieved little guy His hyperactivity has mellowed but not too much In host chat his specialty Regis turns the mundane details of his life a lost wallet a urinary tract problem a disagreement with Live s producer into comic gems Most performers mask their insecurity with ego Regis shares his insecurity He can take offense at anything He is cotton candy spinning TV sugar out of thin air Kathie Lee endlessly chipper and extra perfect serves as superb foil for Regis peevishness He jabs her mocking her singing and her tedious stories about her son She punches right back It is an amusingly petty domestic drama enacted every morning at 9 Regis comic persona reinforces his second gift a perfect relationship with the camera No one talks to the screen better than Regis He is the last of the true broadcasters who can go on the air and spout about nothing says Zehme He is never at a loss to speak to the camera as if it were you This is one reason why David Letterman Larry King and other TV celebs idolize Reege Regis seems genuine on camera in part because his personality and TV persona have joined Profiles of Philbin are tedious because he has revealed everything on the show his latest squabble with his wife etc There is no secret life of Regis Philbin While criticizing sensationalistic confessional talk shows he divulges everything about himself He just doesn t have anything salacious to tell It is too bad that so many Americans are meeting Regis as the host of Millionaire click for a description of the game Though Millionaire has brought ABC its first sweeps win since oh the 19 th century the show does not do Regis justice He is a creature of sunny day not shadowy night He is restrained on Millionaire forbidden to indulge in his stories ad libs and insults His job is to make the contestants sweat but he s no good at it He s too light to play the heavy The dark suits he wears make him look like a lounge singer not an enforcer His voice cannot convey menace His attempts to daunt contestants are more genial than ominous although Is that your final answer has become a national catchphrase And Regis certainly doesn t exude the Olympian wisdom you d expect from the host He often seems more surprised to learn the answer than the contestants do Even so Reege may be the ideal game show host for this ironic age He allows the show to be both deadly serious and parody Millionaire is portentously heavy yet run by a man with no gravitas It concerns itself with something that matters a million bucks yet Regis presence makes it frivolous With a somber host Millionaire would be oppressive Thanks to Regis it is the perfect 90s experience You can enjoy it as challenge kitsch or both
