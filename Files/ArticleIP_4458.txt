 The Mother Tongue By Eavan Boland posted Wednesday Oct 21 1998 To hear the poet read The Mother Tongue click The old pale ditch can still be seen less than half a mile from my house its ancient barrier of mud and brambleswhich mireth next unto Irishmenis now a mere rise of coarse grass a rowan tree and some thinned out spruce where a child is playing at twilight I stand in the shadows I find ithard to believe now that oncethis was a source of our division Dug Drained Shored up and leftto keep out and keep in That herethe essence of a colony s defencewas the substance of the quarrel with its purpose Land Ground A line drawn in rainand clay and the roots of wild broom behind it the makings of a city beyond it rumours of a nation by Dalkey and Kilternan and Balallythrough two ways of saying their names A window is suddenly yellow A woman is calling a child She turns from her play and runs to her name Who came here under cover of darknessfrom Glenmalure and the Wicklow hillsto the limits of this boundary Who whisperedthe old names for love to this earthand anger and ownership as it openedthe abyss of their future at their feet I was born on this side of the Pale I speak with the forked tongue of colony But I stand in the first dark and frost of a winter night in Dublin and imagine my pure sound my undivided speechtravelling to the edge of this silence As if to find me And I listen I hearwhat I am safe from What I have lost
