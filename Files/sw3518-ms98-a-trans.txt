                okay Brian   hi how you doing Kevin     fine thanks   good good glad to hear that i understand are     are you a total banner   total banner no i i believe that uh the American public and i as an individual and private citizen have a right to to bear arms and to have a gun as long as i uh am responsible with it   yeah   and protect the safety and welfare of my kids and and so that theyre not playing with it and so that they cant hurt themselves or anyone else playing with it i think that education with a gun is is critical and important um however i do believe that uh guns ought to be maintained and and controlled that you cant go out and just buy one off the corner and do whatever you want with it because people that are angry or have concerns or want to get seek vengeance right away have easy access to guns and in the heat of the moment they can go and do some damage that can hurt themselves and other people so on a scale of one to ten i i think i would rate myself as a in the six or seven or eight   no   but i think that there ought to be some control but i still think that uh individuals have a right how do you feel about it   okay well so let me make sure so so you think that uh maybe a five day waiting period for handguns or that stuff would be legitimate   well i dont know if a five day waiting period would be legitimate uh that uh that might cool down some tempers i think a a one day would be sufficient the reason i say that is theres an awful lot of people who go to gun shows and if you see an awful lot of exhibits and things and if you would like to purchase a gun if that five day waiting period were in effect that you wouldnt be able to purchase one at that gun show   uh you just youd be able to buy it but theyd just have to mail it to you i suppose huh   well i dont think you can mail thing guns through the mail i dont know  i think thats a against the law ever since Kennedy was   oh okay well     assassinated so how do you feel about guns   oh really lets see i think that gun control has come up because theres been some crazies that killed people with guns and i think thats the problem that we need to address is why these people want to kill other people rather than the instrument they particularly used in the assault whether you know   umhum well do you think that there will continue to always be crazies   sure   then uh how do you propose that we prohibit those types of individuals from gaining access to guns   well we have some laws on the books that uh dont allow convicted felons to purchase guns if i understand correctly and uh i would agree a a short waiting period would be appropriate to uh take care of the heat of the moment type things but   umhum   uh i think banning semiautomatic twenty two rifles is a a bit on the extreme side   umhum   and a total ban on guns would just leave guns in the hands of criminals who dont care what the rules are anyway   okay do you uh do you feel that there is a need in the world today to have a an automatic handgun   the only purpose for handguns is to shoot people in my opinion or or you could do it just for fun you know kind of like a game but uh   well i think that the the police uh or law enforcement have a need because of the tight quarters they might find themselves but the public i dont know   i think that i should have a right to own a handgun not a automatic semiautomatic   umhum yeah not an Uzi   no no uh but i think a person needs a way of defending themselves   umhum   you saw Indiana Jones the guy came after him with that big knife   yes   and just he took care of him just one shot           yes thats true and he uh saved himself in the in the in the process also   thats right so hows work going   very fine very very   they dont let you take guns to work do they   no they thats uh thats prohibited where we work although down here in Texas uh you do have a right to to wear and carry arms with you at all times     uhhuh   thats still uh thats still you can still do that down here   can they be is it concealed or does it have to   oh you cant no it it should not be concealed   has to be on the hip   it has to be on the hip  has to be in sight so that uh       yeah that youre not uh a menace or a problem to individuals how about where you live there in Utah   can a
