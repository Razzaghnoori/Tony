 Pay Up Shrum On Meet the Press yesterday Gore adviser Robert Shrum attempted manfully to deny that his candidate had ever suggested he d make support of his policy on gays in the military a litmus test for nomination to the Joint Chiefs of Staff All Gore was doing Shrum said was restating the constitutional principle that the Chiefs are obliged to obey their commander in chief What he said was that he would insist that people appointed to the Joint Chiefs of Staff agree to support his policy as president He never said in the New Hampshire debate that he would inquire into their personal convictions His litmus test is a constitutional one civilian control of the military I defy you to find a place in that transcript where he ever said he would inquire into someone s personal position I ll bet you 10 bucks Find him saying that he s going to examine their personal convictions Nice try Bob But the transcript of the New Hampshire debate makes it pretty damn clear that Gore was saying exactly what Shrum said he didn t say The video clip played by MTP host Tim Russert might not have nailed the issue down it showed Gore declaring I would insist before appointing anybody to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that that individual support my policy But the discussion that precedes the clip does The whole context was Peter Jennings question about whether Gore or Bradley would apply a litmus test to Joint Chiefs nominees like that occasionally applied controversially to Supreme Court nominees In the context of the Supreme Court of course litmus test clearly means an inquiry into a potential nominee s personal convictions on say abortion or civil rights prior to their nomination Gore said he had rejected the notion of litmus tests on the Supreme Court by saying there are ways to find out the kind of judgment somebody has without posing specific litmus tests He then said I think that it s a little different where the Joint Chiefs of Staff are concerned because you re not interfering with an independent judicial decision As commander in chief a president is giving orders in effect or he is the superior of the officers that are reporting to the commander in chief in the chain of command I would try to bring about the kind of change in policy on the don t ask don t tell policy that President Harry Truman brought about after World War II in integrating the military And I think that would require those who wanted to serve in on the position of on the Joint Chiefs of Staff to be in agreement with that policy So yes Emphasis added This isn t quite a smoking gun but it s mighty close As Gore s boss might say it all depends on what the definition of in agreement with is It was clear to me watching the debate that Gore meant that the nominee s personal views had to be in agreement For one thing that is what in agreement means It s also what the explicit analogy with the Supreme Court litmus test implies Otherwise Gore would have said You don t need a litmus test because they have to obey the policy whatever their personal views are Or he could have used the word obey or support instead of be in agreement with This interpretation is reinforced by the reality of the gays in the military debate The president can t just order the Chiefs to change the don t ask policy since that policy has now been written into law by Congress and changing it requires congressional action That s why it would be so important for a president to know that his Joint Chiefs nominees personally support his policy so they ll be on his side in the battle with Congress and not just that they will obey him which wouldn t do the president any good Bob Don t you owe someone 10 Conflict of interest disclosure Shrum and his wife Marylouise Oates are friends of mine I ve eaten dinner at their house I ve even stayed there when in Washington God it s all too embarrassing I think Shrum may have been a good soldier in this instance attempting to defend an untenable position But in a very brief phone conversation he said he d read the whole transcript and he seemed sincere in sticking to his interpretation I admit I haven t been so understanding of others such as James Carville who haven t fed me so many meals
