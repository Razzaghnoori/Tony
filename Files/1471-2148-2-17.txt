 Background Artemisia L Asteraceae as broadly conceived by Linnaeus is the largest genus in Tribe Anthemideae 1 2 3 and one of the largest in the family 4 It is widespread in mid to high latitudes and shrubby species dominate most cold and many warm deserts in the Northern Hemisphere 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Because of the abundance of wind dispersed Artemisia pollen in the geological column it is used as an indicator of steppe climates 14 Some members are foraged by ungulates rodents birds and insects 11 15 16 17 18 19 despite the production of sesquiterpenes that afford a bitter taste to the herbage The woody species increase dramatically under grazing pressure thereby excluding desirable forage 11 20 21 Many Artemisia species are a major cause of allergies in humans 22 All Artemisia species produce aromatic oils and several are culinary herbs or used as flavorings hallucinogens vermifuges and pharmaceuticals 23 24 25 26 and some are toxic 27 Artemisia annua annual wormwood and A mexicana produce antimalarial drugs 28 29 30 and artemisinin from A annua appears to selectively kill human breast cancer cells 31 Despite the well known importance of Artemisia there is no consensus on taxonomic relationships which have traditionally been inferred on the basis of floral and capitular morphology In Artemisia s l the typical limb of the Anthemideae type ray florets are reduced to a membranous vestige giving the impression that the small capitula are composed only of disk florets referred to as disciform capitula inflorescence by Bremer and Humphries 2 In other members of the genus the ray flowers are absent thus the capitulum is composed only of disk florets i e discoid In addition plants with discoid capitula are considered homogamous since all florets are of one sexual form perfect bisexual disk florets and plants with disciform capitula are considered heterogamous with two or more sexual forms i e pistillate rays and perfect disks or pistillate rays and staminate disks Taxonomic treatments for Artemisia over the past 50 years range from maintaining a single large genus of over 500 species 32 33 34 35 36 37 to the recognition of six to eight genera from within its taxonomic boundaries 2 38 39 Artemisia of antiquity was divided into three genera Artemisia Absinthium and Abrotanum by Tournefort 40 However the concept of a more inclusive genus was resurrected by Linnaeus 41 hereinafter referred to as Artemisia s l Besser 42 and de Candolle 43 recognized four sections within Artemisia s l primarily based on the presence or absence of ray florets and the fertility sterility of disk florets 1 Abrotanum Besser Artemisia of later authors ray florets pistillate and fertile disk florets perfect and fertile receptacle glabrous 2 Absinthium Mill DC ray florets pistillate and fertile disk florets perfect and fertile receptacle hairy 3 Seriphidium Besser Besser ray florets absent disk florets perfect and fertile receptacle glabrous and 4 Dracunculus Besser ray florets pistillate and fertile disk florets functionally staminate receptacle glabrous The first phylogenetic treatment 44 recognized four sections within a broadly defined Artemisia s l with sect Artemisia proposed as the progenitor to sect Absinthium Dracunculus and Seriphidium This phylogeny was based on two hypothesized evolutionary trends loss of fertility in the disk florets and loss of ray florets Sect Artemisia and Absinthium were later united 45 and all sections were raised to the level of subgenus 46 47 i e subg Artemisia Dracunculus and Seriphidium In addition a number of authors 20 21 34 35 47 48 considered the American woody sagebrushes to have an independent origin from the woody Asian species subg Seriphidium and recognized sect Tridentatae Poljakov 38 and others 2 segregated subg Seriphidium as a distinct genus along with several small genera from within the boundaries of Artemisia s l The more recent major classifications 2 39 49 50 have agreed with the segregation of Seriphidium on the basis of discoid homogamous capitula and recognized the smaller segregate genera as well Ling 39 51 52 for instance considered Artemisia s s and Seriphidium to be distinct and sister to each other and with the small segregate and allied genera in turn sister to them 53 In their landmark monograph of Tribe Anthemideae Bremer and Humphries 2 placed Artemisia and its allied genera in Subtribe Artemisiinae In contrast to Ling s hypothesis 53 regarding sister group relationships between Artemisia s s and Seriphidium the Bremer and Humphries 2 morphologically based cladogram placed four small genera Neopallasia Turaniphytum Mausolea Picrothamnus with a total of seven species as closest sisters i e segregates of Artemisia s s the Artemisia clade sensu Bremer and Humphries whereas Seriphidium and two small genera Kaschgaria Crossostephium 3 species total were placed outside the Artemisia clade as allies to Artemisia s s In addition Sphaeromeria Filifolium Ajaniopsis and Stilnolepis 13 species total were sister to this clade of eight genera that included Artemisia s s and its segregates and allies Further Ling and Ling 54 recognized Elachanthemum as distinct from Stilnolepis i e as two monotypic genera Altogether these 12 13 genera comprise the Artemisia group sensu Bremer and Humphries According to Bremer and Humphries 2 the Artemisia group is monophyletic and defined by heterogamous disciform capitula disk florets usually bisexual and fertile ray florets pistillate or homogamous discoid capitula disk florets usually bisexual and fertile ray florets absent pollen with short or no spines associated with anemophily and thick walled cypselas devoid of ribs sometimes faint ribs are present in Sphaeromeria and Crossostephium All of the Artemisia group genera contain species that have been variously placed within the taxonomic boundaries of Artemisia s l with the exceptions of Sphaeromeria Neopallasia Turaniphytum and Mausolea Nonetheless these four genera are always considered closely related to it 2 33 37 38 55 Artemisia s s and Seriphidium are composed of approximately 380 and 140 species respectively and are geographically widespread Their species occur predominantly throughout Europe and temperate Asia as well as in western North America Sphaeromeria and Picrothamnus are endemic to western North America whereas all remaining Artemisiinae genera occur in eastern southwestern or central Asia Several biological factors may account for the disagreement and wide range of interpretation in relation to generic circumscription and subgeneric boundaries in Artemisia and its allies including rapid and recent diversification reduction in floral features associated with anemophily with the concomitant loss of potentially useful taxonomic characters multiple origins of woodiness 34 35 56 and chromosomal evolution and hybridization 57 58 59 60 In addition most studies have focused on a limited geographic region rather than studying the taxon worldwide The primary objective of this study is to construct a molecular phylogeny of Subtribe Artemisiinae including Artemisia and its allies employing the internal transcribed spacers ITS of nuclear ribosomal nr DNA The goals are 1 to test the monophyly of Subtribe Artemisiinae and the Artemisia group 2 determine the phylogenetic placements of the segregate and allied genera in relation to Artemisia s s and 3 evaluate the patterns of diversification and test biogeographic hypotheses and evolutionary trends in capitular and floral morphology in the Artemisia group 49 50 The ITS have been demonstrated to be appropriate for examining generic relationships in many plant families including the Asteraceae 61 for Tribe Anthemideae specifically 62 63 and within Artemisia 34 36 Results The PCR products of the ITS were resolved as single bands on 1 0 agarose gels Of the 520 aligned nucleotide positions for both spacers combined excluding gaps required for alignment 213 were phylogenetically informative Sequence divergence uncorrected p is 4 6 among members of the Artemisia clade 4 10 among members of Subtribe Artemisiinae and 7 17 between Subtribe Artemisiinae and the outgroup species from other Anthemideae subtribes Resulting phylogenetic trees obtained by maximum parsimony MP maximum likelihood ML and Bayesian analyses were congruent in topology All three analyses resolved three major clades for Subtribe Artemisiinae with MP the least resolved and ML the most highly resolved The topologies differed in the placement of Stilnolepis which was placed outside of Subtribe Artemisiinae by MP and at the base of the subtribe by both ML and Bayes Otherwise the tree topologies differed only in their ability to resolve relationships within the three major clades numbered 1 2 3 in Fig 1 Using MP two analyses 10 replicates with TBR branch swapping on 5000 trees per replicate and 100 replicates with TBR branch swapping on 1000 trees per replicate resulted in 30 000 equally parsimonious trees of 1056 steps CI 0 339 RI 0 707 RC 0 240 The resulting consensus trees from each MP analysis are identical in topology with little resolution achieved trees not shown Three major clades of Subtribe Artemisiinae were resolved and include 1 species of all Artemisia subgenera except subg Drancuculus as well as Seriphidium Crossostephium Neopallasia and Sphaeromeria 2 Filifolium and species of Artemisia subg Dracunculus and 3 Ajania Arctanthemum Dendranthema and Elachanthemum Kaschgaria is placed within the Subtribe Artemisiinae clade but its position is unresolved while Stilpnolepis is placed outside the subtribe The closest sister genera to Subtribe Artemisiinae are Nipponanthemum and Leucanthemella Subtribe Leucantheminae Three genera Oncosiphon Eriocephalus and Microcephala from Subtribe Matricariinae are sister to this larger clade Bootstrap analysis supported 17 ingroup nodes for the MP tree at values 50 and are indicated on the ML tree Fig 1 The ML analysis converged upon a single tree with a log likelihood value of 6970 3335 Likelihood parameters for the dataset were determined by Modeltest 3 06 for the TrN G model and included the following base frequencies of A 0 2482 C 0 207 G 0 2466 T 0 2982 r matrix values of A C 1 0000 A G 3 1857 A T 1 0000 C G 1 0000 C T 5 1655 G T 1 0000 and a gamma distribution of 0 5663 The ML tree resolved Subtribe Artemisiinae as monophyletic with Leucanthemella and Nipponanthemum as its closest sisters Within Subtribe Artemisiinae Stilnolepis and Kaschgaria form independent clades at the base of the subtribe Similar to the MP tree the same three major clades are resolved Fig 1 Bootstrap analysis of the data using ML criteria was not computationally feasible given the size of the data set Therefore as an alternative we conducted a Bayesian analysis utilizing a GTR model with 6 rate classes A C 1 A G 3 19 A T 1 C G 1 C T 5 16 G T 1 for 1 10 6generations sampled every 10 generations that resulted in a posterior probability distribution containing 1 10 5samples The analysis converged on similar log likelihood scores mean 2431 and reached stationarity no later than 2500 generations The initial burn in 2500 samples from the analysis were discarded and a majority rule consensus tree of the remaining 97 500 samples was constructed to obtain posterior probabilities and resulted in a tree with 21 ingroup nodes with a significance level 95 Posterior probabilities are indicated on the ML tree Fig 1 The Bayesian tree was identical in topology to the ML tree with the exception that the New World Seriphidium subclade was unresolved Discussion Monophyly of Subtribe Artemisiinae and the Artemisia group The ITS data provide weak support for the monophyly of Subtribe Artemisiinae Fig 1 i e 67 posterior probability as estimated by MrBayes and unsupported as measured by parsimony bootstrap analysis 50 ndh F sequence data also failed to resolve or support the monophyly of Subtribe Artemisiinae 64 In the ITS phylogeny only one genus appears to disrupt its monophyly Stilnolepis which occupies the basal most position of the ingroup However the next node up is supported at a 94 posterior probability indicating that Subtribe Artemisiinae is likely monophyletic with the possible exception of Stilnolepis The ITS phylogeny Fig 1 resolved three major clades within Subtribe Artemisiinae that correspond to the following 1 all subgenera of Artemisia minus Dracunculus 2 Artemisia subg Dracunculus and 3 the largely radiate members of the subtribe Ajania Arctanthemum and Dendranthema All three clades have segregate genera embedded within each indicated in bold and these clades are supported at 77 74 and 99 posterior probabilities respectively with the third clade also supported by a bootstrap value of 99 The Artemisia group sensu Bremer and Humphries 2 is not monophyletic because three segregate genera Elachanthemum Stilnolepis and Kaschgaria are excluded from this clade Additionally Artemisia s l is monophyletic only with the inclusion of five segregate genera Seriphidium Sphaeromeria Neopallasia Crossostephium and Filifolium Additionally this clade is only weakly supported with a 63 posterior probability and bootstrap support 50 Placement of segregate and allied genera Three of the eight segregate and allied genera that we examined were placed outside of the Artemisia group including Stilnolepis Elachanthemum and Kaschgaria whereas the remaining five were placed within it including Seriphidium Sphaeromeria Neopallasia Crossostephium and Filifolium However many of these placements are among the most weakly supported branches of the resulting phylogenetic trees Fig 1 Stilnolepis Elachanthemum and Kaschgaria are excluded from the clade of the Artemisia group and are in part sister to all remaining Artemisiinae genera in the ITS phylogeny Stilnolepis and Elachanthemum are monotypic genera that occur in Central Asia that are often treated as a single genus Stilnolepis 2 However our ITS phylogeny supports Ling s treatment of them as two distinct genera 54 Neither genus appears to be a member of Artemisia s l or the Artemisia group Both genera are discoid with corymbose capitula but whether either genus possesses spineless pollen a synapomorphy for the Artemisia group or is wind pollinated has not yet been determined 2 37 Kaschgaria a genus of two species from China and central Asia is also placed outside of the Artemisia group but clearly within Subtribe Artemisiinae 94 probability in the ITS phylogeny Kaschgaria was removed by Poljakov from Artemisia s l on the basis of stellate corolla hairs and was considered more closely related to Seriphidium than Artemisia s s even though it is disciform rather than discoid 2 Kaschgaria possesses spineless pollen 2 37 Therefore placement of Kaschgaria and Elachanthemum outside of the Artemisia group is intriguing because if these placements remain robust wind pollination may have arisen more than once in the tribe or insect pollination may be secondarily derived within Subtribe Artemisiinae in the radiate genera clade 3 of Fig 1 Four of the small allied segregate genera are embedded within the clade of the Artemisia group in addition to the large segregate genus Seriphidium Fig 1 Filifolium is sister to species of subg Dracunculus and together comprise a sister clade to all remaining Artemisia species and four segregate genera moderately supported at 74 probability Monotypic Filifolium occurs in China and Korea and was previously considered a species of subg Dracunculus on the basis of sterile disk florets Cassini 65 segregated subg Dracunculus as Oligosporus with the sterility of the central florets as the defining synapomorphy that unites these species Fig 2b Bremer and Humphries 2 noted that Mausolea and Picrothamnus share this trait and suggested that Oligosporus should be resurrected and defined to include these three segregate genera Mausolea was segregated by Poljakov 38 from Artemisia s l by marginal flowers that lack corollas Picrothamnus was established by Nuttall but reduced as A spinescens Hall and Clements and according to Bremer and Humphries 2 is essentially Dracunculus with two autapomorphies spiny habit and cobwebby pilose cypselas Thus two taxonomic treatments are viable 1 the recognition of two subgenera within Artemisia s l subg Dracunculus and an expanded subg Artemisia or 2 the resurrection of Oligosporus following Cassini to include species of subg Dracunculus Filifolium and perhaps Mausolea and Picrothamnus Unfortunately we were unable to obtain ITS sequences for Mausolea or Picrothamnus Monotypic Crossostephium was treated as a segregate genus of Artemisia by Bremer and Humphries 2 It is distinct from Artemisia by the presence of a coroniform pappus however it was once placed near A californica by Gray 45 and Rydberg 47 on the basis of deeply ribbed cypselas Crossostephium occurs in the Phillipines Taiwan southern Japan and China whereas A californica occurs in western North America Based on the ITS results we conclude that Crossostephium is allied with Old World Seriphidium and several Artemisia subg Artemisia species and A californica is sister to most of the New World species of Seriphidium Fig 1 Although placements of both are weakly supported 68 and 57 probabilities for Crossostephium and A californica respectively Fig 1 Neopallasia is a genus of three species that occur in central Asia including southern Siberia Mongolia and China 2 It was segregated from Artemisia by Poljakov 66 on the basis of several autapomorphies including pectinate leaves central sterile florets at the apex of the capitulum ovoid lanceolate anther appendages and a rosette shaped arrangement of cypselas on the receptacle Poljakov 66 and Bremer and Humphries 2 contended that Neopallasia is closely related to Artemisia subg Drancunculus However the ITS data place Neopallasia sister to Asian species of Seriphidium and some members of Artemisia subg Artemisia close to Crossostephium This placement is moderately supported at 87 probability Sphaeromeria is considered closely related to Artemisia s l although it was once treated as a section of Tanacetum 55 It is a small genus of nine western North American species and has no autapomorphies that distinguish it from Artemisia s l Bremer and Humphries 2 suggested that it might be more closely related to Kaschgaria a genus composed of two species that occur in central Asia and China They are similar in habit and have similar inflorescences that are slightly elongated However in the ITS phylogeny Fig 1 Sphaeromeria is distant to Kaschgaria Rather its placement is unsupported within a Seriphidium subclade that contains several anomalous North American species some of which have been placed in sect Tridentatae However because of the lack of support for placement of Sphaeromeria we are hesitant to suggest that it be submerged in Artemisia s l without further study However it does not appear closely related to Kaschgaria Seriphidium palmeri is an anomalous species that was once treated as segregate genus Artemisiastrum The ITS phylogeny places it among New World subg Artemisia species in agreement with previous studies 34 35 and not in agreement with Bremer and Humphries 2 who place it near Seriphidium sect Tridentatae This is a strongly supported relationship at 100 bootstrap and 99 probability Thus Artemisiatrum should not be resurrected with S palmeri more closely related to the New World species of Artemisia subg Artemisia rather than with the New World Seriphidium species that comprise sect Tridentatae Infrageneric classification of Artemisia s l While this study is incomplete with regards to subgeneric boundaries because only a limited number of Artemisia species was sampled from this large genus some preliminary conclusions can still be made on emerging patterns of the derived phylogeny Artemisia subg Artemisia is not supported as monophyletic with its species placed in six different clades in the ITS tree Fig 1 It is apparently defined taxonomically on the basis of plesiomorphies heterogamous disciform capitula with perfect fertile disk florets and pistillate ray florets and needs to be re circumscribed Artemisia subg Absinthium is monophyletic 96 probability 76 bootstrap in the ITS phylogeny and differs from all other subgenera by a hairy receptacle However it is embedded within a clade of species of Old World subg Artemisia Thus we agree with Gray 45 that the species of subg Absinthium should be merged into subg Artemisia Similarly Old World Seriphidium species are monophyletic 96 probability but should also be subsumed within Artemisia subg Artemisia Previously the origin of the Tridentatae was unresolved with competing hypotheses from the New World Artemisia species vs Old World Seriphidium species being equivocal 34 35 The current ITS phylogeny suggests that the closest relatives of Tridentatae lie among the New World species of Artemisia in agreement with McArthur and Plummer 20 perhaps sharing a common ancestry with A filifolia and A californica in addition to Sphaeromeria although monophyly for this subclade is unsupported by the ITS data Seriphidium sect Tridentatae does not share a most recent common ancestor with Old World Seriphidium species and it should not be treated with the Old World woody artemisias as we and others have previously suggested 34 35 36 Seriphidium sect Tridentatae is characterized by discoid homogamous capitula with the exception of S bigelowii which has occasional heterogamous disciform capitula of one pistillate ray floret and two perfect disk florets a character that was previously considered a plesiomorphy or secondary reversal in S bigelowii 2 Based on ITS and chloroplast phylogenies of sect Tridentatae we previously concluded 34 35 that S bigelowii was perhaps misplaced and should be excluded from the Tridentatae In addition we explained 34 35 an unexpected relationship between it and A filfifolia as possible hybridization and introgression involving bidirectional gene flow rather than recent common ancestry because heterogamous disciform A bigelowii differs from heterogamous disciform A filifolia by perfect disk florets instead of female sterile disk florets Sphaeromeria also has heterogamous disciform capitula with pistillate ray and perfect disk florets as does heterogamous disciform S bigelowii suggesting that it is indeed a plesiomorphy The occasional appearance of disciform capitula in S bigelowii might be explained by introgression of genes or alleles from A filfolia that control ray expression a phenomenon observed in discoid Senecio squallidus and radiate S vulgaris in Europe 67 While this is speculative it is consistent with hypotheses that hybridization and introgression are widespread in sect Tridentatae 68 and may explain occasional heterogamous disciform capitula in S bigelowii 34 35 However there may be many genetic and developmental mechanisms that affect ray formation and control floret fertility 69 70 Artemisia subg Drancunculus is monophyletic and is sister to all remaining Artemisia species It perhaps combined with Filifolium Mausolea and Picrothamnus could be treated as a separate genus Oligosporus following Cassini or as one of two subgenera of Artemisia In the latter case all remaining species of Artemisia including subg Absinthium and Artemisia and Seriphidium including sect Tridentatae would collectively form a much expanded subg Artemisia Thus Artemisia s l should either be treated as two subgenera i e a largely expanded subg Artemisia Clade 1 of Fig 1 and Dracunculus Clade 2 of Fig 1 or as two distinct genera Artemisia and Oligosporus Both clades are moderately supported at 77 and 74 probabilities and include several segregate genera as well Therefore we favor retaining the Linnean concept of the genus with subg Dracunculus conserved and the numerous segregate genera eventually being subsumed within Artemisia s l Sister group relationships of Subtribe Artemisiinae Sister group relationships of Subtribe Artemisiinae were unresolved on the basis of morphology 2 However an ITS phylogeny of Francisco Ortega et al 62 that primarily focused on the origin of Macaronesian endemic genera of Anthemideae revealed a possible sister group relationship of Leucanthemella and Nipponanthemum Subtribe Leucantheminae to Subtribe Artemisiinae Monotypic Nipponanthemum occurs in Japan and the two species of Leucanthemella occur in Eastern Europe and the Far East in Manchuria Korea and Japan An ITS phylogeny of Subtribe Leucantheminae 71 also excluded these two genera from that subtribe which is otherwise Mediterranean in distribution congruent with a chloroplast phylogeny based on ndh F for the entire tribe 64 The ndh F phylogeny failed to support the subtribal classification of Tribe Anthemideae sensu Bremer and Humphries and failed to resolve the intergeneric relationships or support the monophyly of Subtribe Artemisiinae However this study resulted in the recognition of the importance of biogeography in the evolution of the tribe as a whole with a major divergence between relictual South African genera and Northern Hemisphere Eurasian genera where members of Subtribe Artemisiinae were placed Our ITS phylogeny of Subtribe Artemisiinae that included 40 outgroup genera from seven Anthemideae subtribes also supports a sister group relationship of Nipponanthemum and Leucanthemella to Subtribe Artemisiinae Fig 1 A close resemblance of Nipponanthemum and Leucanthemella to the Asian genus Dendranthema of Subtribe Artemisiinae was previously noted by Bremer and Humphries 2 when they provisionally placed these genera in Subtribe Leucantheminae The ITS data clearly support a sister group relationship between these two genera and subtribe Artemisiinae and their exclusion from Subtribe Leucantheminae Both Leucanthemella and Nipponanthemum are radiate supporting a radiate ancestry for Subtribe Artemisiinae Evolution of floral traits The genera that comprise the Artemisia group are closely related and were considered monophyletic on the basis of ancestrally disciform heterogamous capitula and spineless pollen with discoid capitula secondarily derived by the loss of ray or marginal florets Fig 2 Phaeostigma and Ajania which are sister to the Artemisia group in the Bremer and Humphries 2 cladogram contain some species that were once classified as Artemisia s l since they are also disciform However these two genera were removed from Artemisia s l and on the basis of spiny pollen have been considered transitional between the Artemisia group and four radiate genera Tridactylina Arctanthemum Brachanthemum and Dendranthema Our ITS phylogeny places disciform Ajania sister to radiate Arctanthemum derived from within the Arctanthemum Dendranthema clade rather than sister to the Artemisia group Thus disciform Ajania does not appear to be intermediate between radiate Artemisiinae and disciform Artemisia and allies Furthermore the tentative placement of disciform Kaschgaria and discoid Stilnolepis sister to the entire subtribe suggests that there may have been multiple origins for disciform as well as discoid capitula Biogeography A complex scenario for the origin and diversification of Artemisia and Seriphidium and subsequent parallel evolution of the two genera in the Old and New Worlds was proposed by Ling 39 49 The putative common ancestor to both sister genera was hypothesized to have existed in northern Asia based on reported fossil pollen records that date the taxa to the early Oligocene or lower Eocene of the lower Tertiary with speciation accompanied by migrations during the Tertiary and Quaternary periods forced southward by the advancing polar ice sheets Hypothesized migrations out of northern Asia purportedly occurred along three lines 1 westward into Europe with gradual migration into North America western Asia Asia Minor the Mediterranean and Africa 2 eastward into Siberia into western North America and into eastern Europe and 3 further south into Asia primarily during the Quaternary Seriphidium is clearly embedded as two distinct clades within Artemisia in the molecular phylogenies making a sister group relationship unlikely According to Ling 39 49 a pro Absinthium ancestor in northern Asia gave rise to members of Absinthium which directly gave rise to Abrotanum which subsequently gave rise to Seriphidium An Absinthium origin for Seriphidium has also been proposed on the basis of flavonoid data 72 The ITS data do not support a sister group relationship of members of subg Absinthium to the remainder of Artemisia s l In contrast Absinthium is embedded within a derived clade composed of both Old and New World members of subg Artemisia A proposed secondary diversification occurred during the Himalayan uplift in the late Tertiary and resulted in a center of diversity that today harbors 116 species of regional endemics of Artemisia s s A more detailed examination of Artemisia s l is necessary to more fully evaluate this hypothesis Hall and Clements 44 proposed a sister group relationship of subg Artemisia to remaining subgenera This hypothesis is also not supported because subg Artemisia is not monophyletic In contrast the ITS phylogeny supports an early divergence of subg Dracunculus from the remaining Artemisia subgenera It appears that the New World species of Artemisia s l are paraphyletic and that the North American lineages arose once with at least one back migration to the Old World by some members of subg Artemisia and Absinthium Fig 2 Alternatively the North American lineages may have arisen twice independently Graham 73 suggested that the most convincing earliest fossil pollen records for Artemisia are late Oligocene from Central Europe In all likelihood Subtribe Artemisiinae and Artemisia s l originated in Eurasia sharing a relatively ancient common ancestry with Asian members of Leucantheminae and South African members of Subtribe Matricariinae 64 Conclusion The ITS data do not support the segregation of numerous small genera or Seriphidium from within the boundaries of Artemisia Two major clades for Artemisia s l are supported and include subg Dracunculus and subg Artemisia with the segregate genera and subgenera of Artemisia embedded within subg Artemisia Additionally three segregate genera are placed outside of the Artemisia clade For Subtribe Artemisiinae the Artemisia group of species are sister to the radiate genera Additional molecular markers are necessary to further resolve relationships within the Artemisiinae before making taxonomic decisions to subsume all segregate genera within Artemisia s l Methods ITS sequences were obtained for 57 species representing 11 genera of Subtribe Artemisiinae and 41 outgroup species from seven additional Anthemideae subtribes Voucher specimens were deposited in herbaria see additional file 1 Total genomic DNA was isolated from fresh or silica gel dried leaves using the 2X CTAB procedure 74 75 The ITS region was amplified using primers of White et al 76 as previously described 34 For unpublished sequences the spacers were sequenced on an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer using capillary sequencing and Big Dye Terminator Chemistry Applied Biosystems Inc Foster City CA The sequence boundaries of the spacers were determined by comparison to published Artemisia sequences 34 and complete sequences were deposited in GenBank see additional file 1 All ITS sequences were aligned using Clustal W 77 with manual gap adjustments made to improve the alignment see additional file 2 nexus doc Additional file 1 Microsoft Word file of list of sample species examined with source of published sequences voucher information and GenBank accession numbers Click here for file Additional file 2 Microsoft Word file of aligned data matrix used for phylogenetic analyses in PAUP Click here for file MP analyses were performed using the software PAUP 4 0 78 assuming unordered character states and equal character state weighting Gaps were treated as missing data The HEURISTICS search option was used ignoring invariant and uninformative characters Random addition of sequences for 10 replicates with TREE BISECTION RECONNECTION TBR branch swapping on 5000 trees per replicate and 100 replicates with TBR swapping on 1000 trees per replicate were performed using the following settings MULTREES STEEPEST DESCENT MAXTREES 30 000 and accelerated transformation ACCTRAN Strict consensus trees were constructed and bootstrap values were calculated as measures of branch support 79 using the following bootstrap parameters 100 bootstrap replicates 5000 MAXTREES per replicate random addition sequence TBR STEEPEST DESCENT and MULTREES In addition the Consistency Index CI Retention Index RI and the Rescaled Consistency Index RC were calculated as measures of homoplasy in the data An ML analysis was also conducted as a preferred alternative to MP since comparative studies have shown that in most situations MP can fail to resolve an accurate phylogeny and generally underestimates bootstrap support 80 Model based analyses such as ML estimate actual site changes from observed by taking into account various aspects of molecular evolution such as multiple hits and among site rate heterogeneity Simulation studies have shown that ML is typically more accurate and robust than MP 81 82 Thus an ML analysis of the data was conducted by employing an heuristic search in PAUP using TBR branch swapping on a starting tree based on neighbor joining ACCTRAN and STEEPEST DESCENT under the TrN G DNA substitution model 83 This model was selected using a Hierarchical Likelihood Ratio Test HLRT in Modeltest version 3 06 84 Because bootstrap analysis using ML is not computationally feasible for large data sets 85 we conducted a Bayesian analysis as an alternative employing optimization parameters similar to the nucleotide substitution model that we used for ML 86 87 The distinction between ML and Bayesian inference is that Bayesian provides probabilities for hypotheses not probabilities of data given a hypothesis 85 87 88 Bayesian analysis uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo MCMC methods to approximate posterior probability distributions that are a direct estimation of branch support because they are the true probabilities of the resulting clades under the assumed models unlike bootstrap values 87 88 Additionally bootstrap values and posterior probabilities derived from Bayesian analyses for multiple data sets appear to be correlated 88 The Bayesian analysis was conducted with the software MrBayes 2 0 89 A GTR substitution model with 6 rate frequencies was selected as the most similar model to the Trn G substitution model the latter model is not available in MrBayes Four MCMC chains were used with initial random starting trees The analysis was run for 1 10 6generations with trees sampled every 10 generations resulting in 1 10 5samples The analysis reached stationarity at 2500 generations and these burnin samples were excluded from the majority rule consensus tree of 97 500 samples which was generated with PAUP to obtain the Bayesian posterior probabilities Authors
