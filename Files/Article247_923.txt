 Is Furby a Must Buy Here s a brief sordid history of toys of the year Fisticuffs have erupted over Cabbage Patch Kids Tickle Me Elmos have been stockpiled and scalped for bank breaking prices Beanie Baby counterfeiters have taken rubes to the cleaners and this year s toy of the year Furby is already sold out of several chains and is being auctioned off on eBay for up to 200 apiece I first got suspicious about Furbys when I read their online instructions which sounded like an excerpt from a pornographic version of G B Shaw s Pygmalion Before you play with me please follow these simple steps Turn me upside down and open my battery door Insert four 4 AA batteries into my battery compartment PLEASE DO NOT CLOSE THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT YET While holding me upside down put your finger in my mouth and hold down my tongue switch then hit Reset button While holding my tongue switch please close my battery door and secure the screw I will now wake up and tell you my name I am now ready to play The doll looks more like a Gremlin than a Galatea furry big ears big eyes no neck The source of its appeal however is Galatea like You teach it learns It has a motor internal speakers a computer chip a light sensor a sound sensor and touch sensors so in addition to old hat tricks like blinking and dancing Furby knows whether you re in the room and will talk sing and generally act cute But most importantly Furby responds to Pavlovian conditioning When you first get the Furby for instance you can tickle its stomach and it may or may not give you a kiss If it kisses you and you immediately pat it on the back you increase the likelihood of it kissing you next time you tickle its tummy Furbys also have their own language Furbish which is heavily influenced by the languages of Thai Chinese Mandarin and Hebrew Over time your Furby will abandon Furbish and begin to learn English actually it doesn t really learn it s just programmed to begin speaking more English words after a while The Furby can even communicate with and teach other Furbys tricks and songs by means of infrared signals similar to the ones in a TV remote control device If one Furby sings a lullaby the other will fall asleep and snore If you play music the Furbys will dance together This is all very cool from an adult s perspective From the child s perspective though the Furby has drawbacks such as The Carapace Issue In order to protect the various motors there has to be a rigid plastic shell under the fur which makes the thing hard to hug Although press materials call it a cuddly standalone animatronic pet in my book animatronic cancels out cuddly The Work Issue Who wants to train a toy to kiss you when every kid knows that a regular stuffed animal kisses you every time you touch its plastic nose to your cheek The Breakability Issue The delicate plastic ear bones are just begging to be snapped and the toy s many cool functions spark curiosity about how it all works In order to satisfy that curiosity you have to skin Furby and crack open the internal plastic shell Another way to see Furby s innards is to check out the exquisite Furby Autopsy Home Page The Grown Up vs Kids Issue As soon as you read that Furby s unique language is heavily influenced by the languages of Thai Chinese Mandarin and Hebrew you know that this is a toy that parents will like more than kids Same goes for all the tricks Furby learns that are cool in concept but boring after about a week Is your child too young for a Furby Will it create more frustration and heartbreak than happiness Is 30 retail or up to 200 online too much for what you get Do you want a furry animatronic pet that burps and worse after you feed it by pushing down on its tongue These questions are all worth considering before you join in on a Furby auction break into a cold sweat over the grim warning on Furby fan pages WAL MART NOW OUT OF FURBYS or smuggle a stun gun into Toys R Us to disable the competition Eliza Truitt
