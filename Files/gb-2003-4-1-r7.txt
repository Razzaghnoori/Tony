 Background DNA microarray experiments simultaneously measure the expression levels of thousands of genes generating huge amounts of data The analysis of these data presents a tremendous challenge to biologists and new tools are needed to help gain biological insights from these experiments Although the data are generated for individual genes examining a dataset on a gene by gene basis is time consuming and difficult to carry out across an entire dataset One way of accelerating the pace of data analysis is to approach the data from a higher level of organization This can be done using data driven methods such as hierarchical clustering and self organizing maps 1 2 which identify groups of genes with similar expression patterns A complementary approach is to view the data at the level of known biological processes or pathways Identifying those groups of biologically related genes that are showing a large number of gene expression changes will create an informative description of the biology that is occurring in a particular dataset making it possible to generate new hypotheses and identify those specific areas of biology that warrant more detailed investigation One tool that assists in the identification of important biological processes is GenMAPP Gene MicroArray Pathway Profiler 3 a program for viewing and analyzing microarray data on microarray pathway profiles MAPPs representing biological pathways or any other functional grouping of genes When a MAPP is linked to a gene expression dataset GenMAPP automatically and dynamically color codes the genes on the MAPP according to criteria supplied by the user GenMAPP is a useful starting point for pathway based analysis of gene expression data but there are several critical requirements to be met before this tool can be used to identify correlated gene expression changes across all biology On a practical level pathway based analysis of microarray data needs to be automated so that all possible pathways can be explored Identifying correlated gene expression changes in an individual pathway is often interesting but it is necessary to know if the gene expression changes seen on a particular pathway are unique to this pathway or are occurring in many other pathways Equally important to automation is expanding the pathway information that is digitally represented GenMAPP currently has over 50 MAPP files depicting various biological pathways and gene families but this is still only a small fraction of all known biology 3 Several other pathway programs such as KEGG 4 EcoCyc MetaCyc 5 Pathway Processor which uses KEGG 6 and ViMAc 7 are available for integration with microarray data analysis but these programs focus on well defined metabolic pathways and like GenMAPP would benefit from a broader base of pathway information To address this issue we have used information available from the Gene Ontology GO Consortium 8 The GO Consortium is creating a defined vocabulary of terms describing the biological processes cellular components and molecular functions of all genes The GO is built in a hierarchical manner with a parent child relationship existing between GO terms Curators at the public gene databases are assigning genes to GO terms to provide annotation and a biological context for individual genes In addition to providing gene annotation GO also provides a structure for organizing genes into biologically relevant groupings These groupings can serve as the basis for identifying those areas of biology showing correlated gene expression changes in a microarray experiment While GO has been used to annotate microarray data both by hand and by some software packages 9 10 11 there has been no automated way to use it for pathway based analysis We have developed a tool called MAPPFinder that dynamically links gene expression data to the GO hierarchy For each of the 11 239 12 as of May 6 2002 GO biological process cellular component and molecular function terms MAPPFinder calculates the percentage of the genes measured that meet a user defined criterion This is done for each specific GO node and for the cumulative total of the number of genes meeting the criterion in a parent GO term combined with all of its children giving a complete picture of the number of genes associated with a particular GO term Using this percentage and a z score see Materials and methods the user can rank the GO terms by their relative amounts of gene expression changes MAPPFinder therefore generates a gene expression profile at the level of biological processes cellular components and molecular functions rapidly identifying those areas of biology that warrant further study Figure 1 MAPPFinder and GenMAPP are both available free of charge at 13 Results and discussion The MAPPFinder browser Viewing the MAPPFinder results as a ranked list is informative but it does not take full advantage of the fact that GO is arranged in a hierarchy MAPPFinder also presents the results in the context of the GO hierarchy Figures 2a 3a showing the entire hierarchy color coded by the percentage of genes changed Users can step through the hierarchy expanding those branches of the tree that are showing gene expression changes moving from broad terms to more specific categories Often the ranked list of terms will show many interrelated terms and it is necessary to view the results in the hierarchy to identify the relationships among them For example the terms RNA metabolism RNA processing mRNA processing and mRNA splicing appear as upregulated in Table 2 However the tree view Figure 2a clearly shows that mRNA splicing is a child term of both RNA splicing and mRNA processing which are in turn child terms of RNA metabolism Similarly the terms main pathways of carbohydrate metabolism catabolic carbohydrate metabolism and glycolysis also appear as downregulated in Table 2 The MAPPFinder browser Figure 3a shows that glycolysis is related to main pathways of carboyhydrate metabolism through the hierarchical relationship between these terms The MAPPFinder browser also provides three search and navigation functions First the user can search by a keyword or an exact GO term name Second the user can search by a gene identifier to find which GO term s the gene is associated with For example searching for the gene alpha myosin heavy chain using its SWISS PROT identifier MYH6_MOUSE or its MGD identifier MGI 97255 finds the GO process terms striated muscle contraction cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis protein modification and muscle development Third the user can expand the GO tree automatically to show all nodes with a minimum number of genes or minimum percentage of genes meeting the criterion or with a minimum z score The terms meeting the filter are highlighted in yellow to clearly indicate the results of the search Once the GO terms of interest have been identified with MAPPFinder the user will want to know exactly which genes are associated with these terms and exactly which genes are being differentially expressed This can be accomplished using GenMAPP Selecting a GO term in the MAPPFinder browser automatically builds a MAPP containing the genes associated with that GO term and all of its children and opens this MAPP in GenMAPP Figure 3bshows the MAPP generated by selecting the GO term glycolysis in the MAPPFinder browser The genes on the MAPP are color coded with the same criteria used to calculate the MAPPFinder results significantly increased and decreased at the 12 5 day embryo time point Clicking on a gene on the MAPP opens a back page containing annotations gene expression data and hyperlinks to that gene s page in the public databases By integrating GenMAPP and MAPPFinder it is possible to seamlessly move from a global gene expression profile at the level of all biological processes components and functions to a detailed description of the gene expression levels for the specific genes involved For example a closer examination of the glycolysis MAPP indicates that hexokinase I is upregulated in the 12 5 day embryo and isoforms II and IV are downregulated as compared with the adult heart This is consistent with hexokinase I being the predominant isoform in the embryonic heart 21 Expanding MAPPFinder beyond GO GO is a good starting point for analyzing microarray data in the context of biological pathways but this is by no means the only way to group related genes Instead of representing each GO process as an alphabetical list on a MAPP it would be more useful to represent the relationships between these genes as a fully delineated pathway As a start in this direction GenMAPP org 13 has created over 50 MAPPs depicting metabolic pathways signaling pathways and gene families MAPPFinder can incorporate any MAPP file into its analysis to augment the GO hierarchy For the FVB benchmark developmental dataset we have run MAPPFinder on an archive of 54 mouse MAPPs available from 13 see Additional data files for the complete results These results for the 12 5 day embryonic time point agree with the GO results showing that the expression of genes involved in the metabolic pathways tricarboxylic acid cycle 83 3 of 12 genes measured z score of 5 91 and fatty acid degradation 69 2 of 13 genes measured z score 4 82 is significantly decreased In addition the significantly increased criterion identified genes encoding ribosomal proteins 71 1 of 45 genes z score 6 75 and genes involved in the cell cycle 53 3 of 15 genes z score 2 4 The archive of MAPPs provided by GenMAPP is in no way comprehensive The growth of this archive depends on assistance from the entire biological community Our hope is that as MAPPFinder users see the added utility of viewing the GO biological processes as fully delineated pathways they will use GenMAPP to organize the gene lists into more descriptive biological pathways Figure 3cgives an example of how the genes from the GO term glycolysis can be rearranged using the tools in GenMAPP to depict the full pathway showing the direction of the enzymatic cascade metabolic intermediates and cellular compartments GenMAPP org is currently accepting submissions of new MAPP files MAPPs contributed by the community will be included in the downloadable MAPP archive MAPPFinder is a necessary complement to current analysis tools By approaching large datasets from a higher level or organization MAPPFinder helps to ease the data analysis and shorten the time necessary to gain a biological understanding of the microarray data MAPPFinder has greatly expanded current pathway based tools by using the large amount of annotations available from the GO This broad analysis will help identify biological processes that have not yet been implicated in a particular experimental condition and begin to make connections between biological processes previously thought to be unrelated MAPPFinder is available for yeast mouse and human data We plan to extend the program to many of the other species that are in GO and updates will be available at 13 Materials and methods Gene expression data The publicly available mouse microarray dataset the FVB benchmark set for cardiac development maturation and aging was obtained from the CardioGenomics Program for Genomics Applications 14 These data compare healthy mouse hearts at different time points during development using male and female FVB N mice Specifically this dataset examines heart tissue from 12 5 day embryos 1 day neonatal mice 1 week mice 4 week mice and adult mice at 5 months and 1 year Our analysis focused on the 12 5 day embryonic time point and the control adult mice Three Affymetrix U74A version 1 arrays were used for each time point For the embryonic time point three hearts were pooled for each array because of their small size To improve the statistical power in our analysis the 5 month and the 1 year mice were combined into a single group of normal adult mice Signal intensity values were obtained with Affymetrix MAS 5 0 software Signal values less than 20 were raised to 20 and the log base 2 was taken Log folds were determined from the average of each time point when compared with the average of the combined control group P values were calculated with a permutation t test The statistical analysis was done using the multest package of the R statistical programming language 22 These data were imported into GenMAPP and the resulting GenMAPP Expression Dataset file gex was exported to MAPPFinder MAPPFinder requires a user defined criterion for a meaningful gene expression change In this case we combined a fold change with a statistical filter to determine significance We are using a fold change of greater than 1 2 with a p value of less than 0 05 to define a significant gene expression increase and a fold change of less than 1 2 with a p value of less than 0 05 to define a significant gene expression decrease To determine the overall number of gene expression changes in each GO term an additional criterion of a fold change greater than 1 2 or less than 1 2 and a p value of less than 0 05 is used data not shown It is important to note that while we have used gene expression data generated from Affymetrix GeneChips data from other microarray platforms and other techniques such as SAGE serial analysis of gene expression can be used equally easily Linking the expression data to Gene Ontology MAPPFinder builds a local copy of the GO hierarchy using the three ontology files Process Component and Function available from GO 12 The directed acyclic graph DAG structure of GO 23 allows a node to be a child of multiple parents This makes the navigation visualization and computation of the MAPPFinder results more difficult than if the GO were stored in a classical tree structure To ease the programming necessary to implement the MAPPFinder algorithm the DAG structure was converted to a classical tree For each node of the DAG that contained multiple parents multiple copies were inserted into the tree representation of the GO using local identifiers to handle duplicate GO terms This tree structure maintains the true path rule enforced in the GO DAG structure MAPPFinder handles this conversion internally and to the user the GO hierarchy seen in the MAPPFinder browser will be identical to that seen in other GO browsers The links between the GO terms and the genes in the expression dataset are made with the gene association files 15 These associations are taken from the European Bioinformatics Institute 24 for human genes the Mouse Genome Database MGD 16 for mouse genes and the Saccharomyces Genome Database SGD 25 for yeast genes Currently the genes in the input data must be identified with GenBank SWISS PROT or SGD identifiers MAPPFinder uses a relational database to link the expression dataset to the gene association files The MAPPFinder database relates gene expression data to the appropriate gene identifrcation systems for each species Figure 1 For human data the gene association files use SWISS PROT identifiers requiring a SWISS PROT to GenBank relational table to link datasets using GenBank accession numbers to the GO annotations For yeast data the gene association files use SGD identifiers A SWISS PROT to SGD relational table is also included for expression datasets using SWISS PROT identifiers For mouse data the GO gene association files use MGD identifiers requiring a GenBank to MGD relational table and a SWISS PROT to MGD relational table MAPPFinder takes advantage of the fact that MGD is also related to UniGene allowing additional ESTs that are not in the MGD GenBank relational table to be used as gene identifiers With this intermediate step many more GenBank identifiers can be linked to GO annotations Currently there is no direct relationship between SWISS PROT and UniGene so a similar intermediate step was not used for human data Calculating the MAPPFinder results MAPPFinder calculates the percentage of genes measured within each GO term that meet a user defined criterion and this measurement is known as the percent changed MAPPFinder also calculates the percentage of the genes associated with a GO term that are measured in the experiment and this measurement is known as the percent present Calculating the percent present is necessary to determine how well represented a GO term is in the dataset The GO gene association files 17 are potentially problematic because they treat each GO term independently removing the implicit parent child relationship As a result looking at the GO terms individually is often uninformative because the number of genes associated with any one term is smaller than the actual number of genes involved in that process component or function To address this issue we calculate the nested percentage for a parent term with all its children below it in the hierarchy By combining the child terms with their parent the results incorporate genes associated with the entire branch of the hierarchy providing a much more accurate representation of the number of genes involved in that process component or function As more specific branches of the GO are examined the denominator of the two equations will become smaller and the user can find their desired level of specificity One complication that arises from this method is that in some cases a gene is associated with both the parent and child terms or multiple child terms When the percentages are calculated for the sub tree we ensure that each gene is only counted once so that genes with multiple annotations are not weighted more heavily Another complication that arises while calculating the MAPPFinder results is the issue of multiple probes of the same gene on the array In this case the features or duplicate genes are clustered to one unique gene If any of the instances of this gene on the array meet the user defined criterion then that gene meets the user defined criterion The number of unique genes is also used to calculate the z score meaning that the statistics are based only on a single occurrence of each gene in the dataset A statistical rating of the relative gene expression activity in each MAPP and GO term is also provided It is a standardized difference score z score using the expected value and standard deviation of the number of genes meeting the criterion on a GO term under a hypergeometric distribution The z score is useful for ranking GO terms by their relative amounts of gene expression changes Positive z scores indicate GO terms with a greater number of genes meeting the criterion than is expected by chance Negative z scores indicate GO terms with fewer genes meeting the criterion than expected by chance A z score near zero indicates that the number of genes meeting the criterion approximates the expected number Extreme positive scores suggest GO terms with the greatest confidence that the correlation between the expression changes of the genes in this grouping are not occurring by chance alone P values are not assigned to the GO terms or MAPPs because while such a standardized difference score could approximate a normal z score for an individual MAPP the lack of independence between GO terms and the multiple testing occurring among them most certainly makes the normal p value for such a z score unreliable As a result p values are not assigned to the GO terms and MAPPs The z score is calculated by subtracting the expected number of genes in a GO term or MAPP meeting the criterion from the observed number of genes and dividing by the standard deviation of the observed number of genes The equation used is or where N is the total number of genes measured R is the total number of genes meeting the criterion n is the total number of genes in this specific MAPP and r is the number of genes meeting the criterion in this specific MAPP Therefore if two GO terms contain the same number of genes the term with the greater number of genes meeting the criterion will receive a higher score Dividing by the standard deviation adjusts for the size of the GO term ranking a GO term or MAPP with a large number of genes meeting the criterion higher than a GO term or MAPP with the same percentage of genes changed but fewer total genes The MAPPFinder
