 Talking the Talk Dear Jodi My high minded self desperately wants to begin our week with an in depth discussion of the troubling article on the back page of this morning s Wall Street Journal entitled Drop in Food Stamp Rolls Is Mysterious and Worrisome This story triggered by a GAO report out this week is a cautionary reminder of the unintended consequences of Bill Clinton s signing the Republican welfare bill Amid all the triumphant rhetoric about the orderly transition from welfare to work it seems that many people who are still entitled to food stamps aren t getting them for reasons that include ignorance new state restrictions and the general down with the welfare state ethos of the age But try as I might my tabloid sensibility keeps being drawn back to the flap over Hillary Clinton s interview with Lucinda Franks in the debut issue of Talk I particularly love the discreet four paragraphs buried on Page A 10 that the New York Times devoted to this topic in my edition of today s paper Like everything else about Hillary the interpretation of this interview completely depends on your pre existing opinions of her For example the Murdoch owned Hillary hating New York Post has a vintage headline on their second day story Shrinks Hillary s Got Poor Excuse for Hubby Meanwhile the Mort Zuckerman owned pro Clinton Daily News finds different experts who claim that HRC s analysis was probably correct when she said her husband s philandering was rooted in an emotionally abused childhood Personally I pity New Yorkers myself included who will be emotionally abused by every element of this Senate race But I also cannot help but be awed by Tina Brown s ability to dominate the news One last thought on the Times lead story on the demise of the Christian Coalition as a potent political force As someone who covers politics I ve long been amused by the cult that surrounded Ralph Reed and the Christian Coalition I m referring not to born again Christians but to political reporters Uncomfortable with religion and culturally out of step with fundamentalism the boys and girls on the campaign buses overhyped a phenomenon that they didn t understand the rise of the Christian Right Only now are the Times and the rest of the press belatedly offering a corrective revision Many more thoughts but I should get about the business of getting these yawn filled Monday morning reflections posted Eagerly awaiting your response Walter
