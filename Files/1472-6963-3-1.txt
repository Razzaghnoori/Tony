 Background Origins of PRWORA In the 1990s Congress moved to reform public spending by reducing the number of beneficiaries on welfare rolls Reforms focused partly on immigrants following testimony from the General Accounting Office estimating that slightly more than half of the Supplemental Security Income SSI benefits provided to elderly persons were collected by noncitizens in 1995 13 14 In justifying PRWORA 15 the House Ways and Means Committee stated that it had been a basic tenet of US immigration policy since 1882 that legal immigrants should not be eligible for public benefits Though Congress did not rescind emergency Medicaid from illegal immigrants the legislation cited a compelling government interest to remove the incentive for illegal immigration provided by the availability of public benefits 13 PRWORA was among several pieces of legislation in the mid 1990s including California s Proposition 187 in 1994 and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 16 that embodied substantive immigration policy changes the specific provisions of which have been enforced in varying degrees according to government priorities PRWORA legislation and states responses PRWORA made several key reforms restricting public assistance for qualified immigrants 17 Prior to the implementation of PRWORA qualified aliens were eligible for the same federal means tested benefits as US citizens PRWORA makes an important distinction between qualified and non qualified immigrants The term qualified alien is used synonymously with legal immigrant and designates a noncitizen who falls into one of the following categories 1 persons lawfully admitted for permanent residence 2 persons granted asylum 3 refugees 4 persons paroled into the United States for at least one year 5 persons for whom deportation is being withheld and 6 persons granted conditional entry The term non qualified alien includes nonimmigrant visitors and undocumented illegal immigrants After PRWORA legal immigrants were declared ineligible for nonemergency Medicaid for their first 5 years in the country with some exceptions as described later The Immigration and Naturalization Service INS estimates that there were 10 5 million 350000 legal permanent residents residing in the United States as of April 1996 18 To qualify for Medicaid coverage after the ban noncitizens must not receive public benefits during the 5 year period 15 Legal immigrants receiving benefits at the time of enactment on August 22 1996 were denied continuation of those benefits starting January 1 1997 Benefits both before and after PRWORA for non qualified aliens remained restricted to emergency Medicaid Before PRWORA states did not consider immigration status in granting Medicaid assistance After PRWORA however most legal immigrants arriving after August 1996 were barred from Medicaid and other state funded assistance at states discretion Exceptions were made for 1 refugees 2 persons granted asylum and persons whose deportation was being withheld 3 armed forces personnel or veterans and their dependent family members and 4 legal permanent residents with 40 qualifying quarters of work 15 Under pressure from the White House and immigrants advocacy groups Congress restored some Medicaid benefits to certain legal immigrants as part of the Balanced Budget Act BBA of 1997 19 20 Under the BBA a legal immigrant could qualify for Medicaid not restricted to emergency Medicaid through SSI eligibility if he or she was lawfully in the United States and receiving SSI benefits on August 22 1996 and subsequently certified under the SSI program as blind or disabled Immigrant populations and use of health care Noncitizens in the United States numbered approximately 17 8 million in 2000 or 6 5 percent of the total population 21 Previous research has shown noncitizens to be more economically disadvantaged and to possess lower levels of health insurance than naturalized and native citizens Census data suggest that noncitizens are more likely than citizens to be poor 29 vs 16 despite the fact that noncitizen families are as likely as citizen families to have at least one full time worker 82 vs 85 22 In their report on insurance rates for Hispanic immigrants the Commonwealth Fund Task Force on the Future of Health Insurance found that the longer Hispanic immigrants had been permanent residents of the United States the more likely they were to be covered by employer related insurance 23 Among low income immigrants in the United States in 1999 59 were uninsured compared to 30 of low income citizens 22 The Kaiser Commission reports that immigrants may underutilize health care regardless of insurance coverage out of fear of jeopardizing their citizenship eligibility by incurring costs as public charges 22 Objective Using data from several sources we present snapshots of information currently available and consider how the financial impact of PRWORA on hospitals might be estimated Based on a review of relevant literature we hypothesized that uncompensated hospital care would be more prevalent in states with lower rates of health insurance coverage higher percentages of foreign born residents used to approximate the population of interest affected by PRWORA higher rates of poverty and greater percentages of teaching hospitals 22 23 24 25 26 We outline the limitations of available data and discuss what information is needed to accurately estimate the outcome of interest Methods Our goal was to examine the effects of PRWORA on hospital uncompensated care expenditures The analysis consisted of two parts a series of data snapshots to describe relevant information and a multivariable regression to model drivers of uncompensated care costs The regression analysis was conducted at the state level because no single source of data includes both patients immigration status and the amount of uncompensated hospital care provided thus precluding hospital or patient level analyses We collected the following state level data for the period from 1994 through 1999 foreign born noncitizen population health uninsurance rates percentage of teaching hospitals as a proportion of all hospitals reporting data per state and each state s decision regarding whether to implement the PRWORA Medicaid bar for legal permanent residents or to continue offering nonemergency Medicaid coverage using state only funds These factors are thought to influence expenditures per admission for uncompensated hospital care 22 23 24 25 26 and were examined at the state level for the period from 1994 to 1999 for a total of 300 observations 6 years 50 states State level data on the percentage of the population uninsured and the percentage of the population comprised of foreign born noncitizens were obtained from the 2000 Current Population Survey March Supplement a detailed description of which is available elsewhere 21 Because the Medicare program covers virtually all Americans aged 65 and older data on insurance coverage rates among nonelderly populations were used As the closest available proxy for the percentage of legal immigrants per state we used the foreign born not a US citizen category available in the Public Basic Monthly Survey for 1994 to 2001 State level poverty data were obtained from the historical poverty tables of the Census Bureau 29 Poverty thresholds are stable across all regions and are adjusted for inflation every year using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers CPI U Aggregate data on uncompensated care were obtained from the American Hospital Association s AHA nationwide Annual Survey of Hospitals 30 AHA defines bad debt as the provision for actual or expected uncollectibles resulting from the extension of credit Charity care services however are provided free of charge to individuals who meet certain financial criteria and are never expected to result in cash inflows Total uncompensated care for hospitals on the state level was estimated as the sum of bad debt and charity care For each state we obtained a sample of all hospitals for which both charity care and bad debt data were available yearly from 1994 to 1999 We calculated uncompensated care per hospital admission as a per capita estimate of uncompensated care These estimates were adjusted to 1999 US dollars using the medical care component of the CPI Teaching hospital status also was obtained from the AHA Annual Survey of Hospitals The AHA defines teaching hospitals as those that are members of the Council of Teaching Hospitals of the Association of American Medical Colleges Teaching hospital percentage refers to the percentage of hospitals classified as teaching hospitals out of the total number of hospitals in a state reporting data to AHA for the years of interest Although every state excluding Wyoming and South Dakota chose to preserve Medicaid coverage for immigrants who were eligible before the enactment of PRWORA i e entering the United States before August 22 1996 states decisions varied on whether to implement the 5 year bar on Medicaid eligibility for qualified immigrants after the enactment of PRWORA Fourteen states California Connecticut Delaware Hawaii Illinois Maine Maryland Massachusetts Minnesota Nebraska Pennsylvania Rhode Island Virginia and Washington maintained Medicaid eligibility for qualified immigrants entering the United States after August 22 1996 through state only funds 31 We included a dichotomous variable in the model describing each state s implementation decision A multiple regression analysis was conducted to test the hypothesis that total uncompensated care the sum of charity care and bad debt per admission would be affected by a state s percentage of foreign born residents poverty rate uninsurance rate percentage of hospitals and the state s implementation decision Because total uncompensated care was heavily skewed we used a log transformed variable as the dependent variable The resulting log linear model has the convenient property of measuring the relative change in the dependent variable uncompensated care for an absolute change in a given predictor variable controlling for other predictors in the model Each year from 1994 through 1999 was entered into the model as a categorical variable omitting 1994 as the reference year We used the Huber 32 and White estimator 33 34 clustered on states to obtain robust error estimates that allow for the lack of independence of observations within a given state over time Statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 6 0 Stata Corporation College Station Tex and SPLUS statistical software Insightful Corporation Seattle Wash This project was approved by the institutional review board of Duke University Medical Center Results Data snapshots state population and hospital characteristics Immigrant population Figure 1displays the

California are also among the states with the highest percentage of foreign born residents although California did not implement PRWORA s Medicaid eligibility bar State implementation decisions Of the 6 states with the highest immigrant populations 70 of the total immigrant population of the United States California and Illinois were the only states that preserved Medicaid coverage for qualified immigrants through state only funds 22 Thirty six states eliminated Medicaid coverage during the 5 year bar 7 31 Poverty Figure 3displays the poverty rate for each state according to US Census data

18 and New York 17 Uncompensated care Figure 4shows the amount of uncompensated care per admission provided by the states with the highest numbers of legal permanent residents California Florida Illinois New Jersey New York and Texas from 1994 through 1999 and the average uncompensated care cost per year for the three year periods before and after PRWORA s enactment Regression model Exploratory analyses showed that uninsurance was highly correlated with the state s poverty rate r 0 70 In addition percentage foreign born and percentage teaching hospitals were highly correlated r 0 30 To avoid collinearity and create a more robust model poverty rate was dropped from the final multivariable regression model percentage of teaching hospitals was dichotomized assigning a value of 1 to states with 5 or more teaching hospitals Both the dependent variable uncompensated care per admission and percentage foreign born were used in log form due to nonnormal distributions revealed in exploratory analyses Results of the multivariable regression modeling Table 1 suggest that controlling for time and a state s foreign born population percentage of teaching hospitals and implementation decision a 1 increase in a state s uninsured population yields a 4 1 increase in the amount of uncompensated care provided P 001 Controlling for all other variables a 1 increase in the log of a state s foreign born population yields a 2 2 increase in uncompensated care though this result was only significant at the 10 level Percentage of teaching hospitals greater than 5 was found to be a weak predictor of uncompensated care but was not significant P 601 A state s decision to implement PRWORA did not independently predict uncompensated care expenditures in our model The trend variables corresponding to years were not significant Discussion PRWORA marked large scale changes in health immigration and welfare policy in the United States Patients hospitals and state and federal governments have all had a stake in PRWORA s enactment An accurate monetary estimate of the effects of PRWORA on hospital uncompensated care due to changes in Medicaid coverage would be useful to policymakers as PRWORA periodically comes up for consideration of renewal and as anecdotal evidence of an adverse financial impact on hospitals continues to mount We hypothesized that hospital uncompensated care expenditures would be greater in states with higher percentages of foreign born residents lower rates of insurance coverage and higher percentages of teaching hospitals Measured at the state level hospital uncompensated care expenditures were not statistically significantly related to percentage foreign born percentage of teaching hospitals or states implementation decisions in our model higher uninsurance rates emerged as the only significant predictor of uncompensated hospital care expenditures This finding suggests that efforts to reduce the number of people uninsured or underinsured would reduce hospitals expenditures on uncompensated care This implication reinforces claims that high rates of uninsurance in United States have negative effects but does not directly address our original hypothesis about the immigrant eligibility provisions of PRWORA As with other studies that have combined disparate data sources to assess the impact of PRWORA on the health or welfare of would be beneficiaries 4 data limitations posed a significant challenge to these analyses The proxy of percentage foreign born may not have accurately captured the population of interest legal immigrants arriving after August 22 1996 who were no longer eligible for nonemergency Medicaid coverage Using the foreign born category from the Census data relies on the assumption that states with higher foreign born populations would also have a greater number of legal immigrants whose eligibility for nonemergency Medicaid would be affected by PRWORA However the foreign born noncitizen category used in Census data defined as any person not born a citizen of the United States and not naturalized includes categories of persons exempted from PRWORA s Medicaid cuts such as asylum seekers and refugees Given that PRWORA requires states that provide health services to report illegal immigrants to authorities it is unlikely that accurate data on immigration status and date of entry into the United States can be collected in the health care setting In addition it is unlikely that any institutional review board would approve the collection of such data in present circumstances Because the main effect of PRWORA was to restrict Medicaid eligibility thereby increasing demand for uncompensated care the present analysis focused on state level parameters linked to demand for medical care Uncompensated care reimbursement pools common in states with former all payer rate setting systems led to increased uncompensated care expenditures throughout the 1990s In a deregulated health care system however states tended to use these funds to expand Medicaid and or Medicaid managed care thus shifting the focus of the pools to reimbursement for charity care only 35 Because of the non uniformity of states approaches to uncompensated care pools their limited use and their changing roles over time we did not include this factor in our final model A monetary estimate on a national state or hospital level of the financial impact of PRWORA remains difficult to ascertain due to data limitations Ideally such research would compare the costs before and after 1996 of the nonemergency care that hospitals provided both as charity care and as bad debt to the category of immigrants who lost nonemergency Medicaid eligibility due to the implementation of PRWORA We would expect the extent and implications of this financial impact to vary according to both hospital characteristics and the populations served Because a patient s immigration status is not recorded concomitantly with hospital resource use in any hospital state or federal database it is not currently possible to isolate charity care and bad debt expenditures on nonreimbursed services for patients whose eligibility for Medicaid has been changed by PRWORA An additional complicating factor is the possibility that as a result of PRWORA hospitals may provide and bill for services as emergency services that previously were categorized as nonemergency services in order to secure Medicaid payment Similarities in income related eligibility criteria for emergency and nonemergency Medicaid would facilitate reclassification Further research should examine the extent to which providers reclassify services Traditionally safety net hospitals have been supported though public funds such as disproportionate share hospital DSH payments The Medicaid DSH payment is based on the assumption that certain hospitals in addition to providing care to Medicaid enrollees also serve indigent persons who are ineligible for Medicaid However there are some indications that public support mechanisms to hospitals may be in jeopardy 36 First DSH payments are large and repeatedly become targets for budget cuts by federal and state governments As a result of provisions in the BBA for example it has been estimated that federal spending on Medicaid DSH will decrease by 11 or 5 8 billion during the period from 1998 through 2002 Since more Medicaid beneficiaries are being cared for in private facilities public safety net hospitals may be affected by both competition for fee for service patients and decreases in overall DSH allotments 37 Finally safety net hospitals typically use Medicaid revenues to help fund uncompensated care decreases in Medicaid reimbursements may therefore further impede hospitals ability to provide services to the uninsured 38 Existing studies of trends in uncompensated hospital care expenditures have focused primarily on supply side covariates such as uncompensated care pools Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments and the degree of competition in the local health care marketplace 25 28 36 39 40 While a focus on such hospital characteristics has helped to elucidate the factors that affect uncompensated care at the hospital level the present study sought to examine the impact of the PRWORA legislation by identifying state level characteristics affecting total hospital uncompensated care per state from 1994 to 1999 Because data used for the regression model came from multiple sources comprehensive year by year figures from 1994 through 1999 were available for all factors in the model only at the state level Because PRWORA gave states the option of changing Medicaid coverage state level information is useful in understanding how PRWORA was implemented across the United States However to better assess the effects of PRWORA on hospitals detailed hospital specific information at least at the level of metropolitan statistical area MSA would be needed on the immigration status of populations served Data limitations currently hamper efforts to obtain a monetary estimate of hospitals financial losses due specifically to PRWORA To better quantify the impact of health policy regulations on health care providers better data sources particularly at the MSA level are needed Competing interests None declared Authors Contributions
