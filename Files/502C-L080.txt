 August 9 1994 Name Address City ST Zip Dear Name You may remember bumping into me somewhere along your path through college I have been with the Department of Manufacturing Technology for about thirty years twenty five years as chairman and have recently retired As I recall I ve never asked you for a contribution until now At the last Honors Convocation the faculty established a scholarship award in my name to honor an Outstanding Student from our department I was moved excited and very surprised by this gesture from the faculty who funded this award from their pockets George F Badger the recipient of the award was equally surprised not to mention a little better off financially I am concerned however about the plans that exist for continuing this award in the future The intent is that the faculty will contribute to the award annually Unfortunately times and members of the faculty change but the need for our students to receive scholarship awards will continue at an unprecedented rate As I see it this can only be done through the establishment of a scholarship fund which will generate sufficient income to support this award I hope you will join me in supporting this scholarship opportunity by sending your check today made payable to the Peale Scholarship Fund I hope this letter finds you and your family in good health I am always happy to hear from you about your accomplishments career family etc Sincerely Robert E Peale Professor Emeritus P S Many corporations will match your gift to the School of Engineering and Technology so I ve enclosed a Double Your Dollars brochure for your convenience
