 Party of Virtue Party of Vice Campaign 98 dispatches from New York and South Carolina Senate and governor The important thing for a pundit is to be sure of his or her opinions There is no penalty for being sure of one thing now and sure of something else later Until 6 p m ET when the first returns came in the analysts were certain that there would be no message tonight This would be a status quo election no big issues were galvanizing voters nothing enormous would be decided But by 7 45 p m the effort to impeach President Clinton was dead as a dodo and MSNBC pundits were wondering how long it would be till enraged Republicans deposed Newt Gingrich as speaker of the House By 9 p m when Chuck Schumer s New York Senate victory was announced the evening had officially become a Democratic Rout The best line of the night came from Sen Fred Thompson R Tenn when some cable news anchor asked him to assess the election results so far When these things aren t going your way you say It s still early So I guess it s still early In terms of seats changing hands the Democratic victory though remarkable is very small Tonight s real landslide victory belongs to two other parties First the Party of Virtue It was a clean sweep for the good guys In tight race after tight race voters have rejected the venal and the wicked North Carolina dumped embarrassing Sen Lauch Faircloth in favor of John Edwards who can t possibly be worse Alabama dropped its ill behaved governor Fob James New Yorkers had the wisdom to retire their chief sleaze Sen Al D Amato in favor of Schumer who has all D Amato s good qualities and only half of his bad ones Maryland re elected a harmless mediocrity Gov Parris Glendening over a holy terror Ellen Sauerbrey And to prove that the Party of Virtue is bipartisan Illinois may drop ethically challenged Sen Carol Moseley Braun Any one of those results constitutes a minor improvement in American politics All of them together constitute a near miracle Tonight s actual miracle Reform Party candidate Jesse The Body Ventura leads in the Minnesota governor s race America has had plenty of athlete politicians and plenty of actor politicians Now at last we can have both in one package a pro wrestler The other big winner Tuesday night oddly enough was the Party of Vice There is much crowing about the resurgence of the Democratic Party in the South given Fritz Hollings Senate victory gubernatorial upsets in South Carolina and Alabama and a probable gubernatorial win in Georgia Why has this happened Because the Democratic Party has become the Lottery Party In Georgia retiring Democratic Gov Zell Miller instituted a hugely popular state lottery that has raised tens of millions of dollars for public education Democrat Roy Barnes who promised to continue Miller s policies is winning the election to succeed him In Alabama and South Carolina the incumbent governors Christian conservative Republicans Fob James and David Beasley resisted efforts to start Georgia style lotteries They are both getting thrown out of office defeated by Democrats running on pro lottery platforms Who says the lottery is a sucker s gamble As they do during the final week of every campaign the Turnout Bores have hijacked the 98 election They have persuaded most of the media that this campaign is a pudding without a theme that there are no galvanizing issues and that everything hinges on which party does a better job getting its core voters to the polls The question Can my blacks and seniors beat your Christian conservatives Never mind that every election hinges on turnout Accept that the Turnout Bores are onto something In fact why not take their theory a step further The election depends on turnout And what more than anything does turnout depend on The weather of course To that end Slate offers a real Election Day forecast predicting the outcomes of close Senate and gubernatorial races based on the Tuesday weather map in Monday s USA Today Why USA Today It does not suffer from the notorious liberal meteorological bias that afflicts the New York Times and the Washington Post In the interest of accuracy Slate has updated the predictions based on USA Today s Tuesday forecast The updated predictions appear in italics after the original predictions According to USA Today most of the country will experience cloudy but good weather Tuesday Rain will fall from Idaho to Georgia At first glance the map looks like good news for the GOP They have close races in many of the rain drenched states and rain generally benefits Republicans who can count on fervent conservatives to get to the polls in any weather But a closer analysis of the weather map suggests Mother Nature actually favors the Democrats this year The survey starts in the Northeast and works its way clockwise around the country It covers most but not all close Senate and gubernatorial races New York Cool and cloudy but no rain Democrats should turn out smartly in New York City helping Chuck Schumer unseat Sen Al D Amato Maryland There is a 30 percent chance of rain in Maryland which means that there is a 30 percent chance of an Ellen Sauerbrey victory in the governor s race Her fervent Republican followers would go to the polls in a typhoon Gov Parris Glendening s supporters are so unenthused that they ll stay home if it merely drizzles It s raining in Maryland this morning Chalk this one up for Sauerbrey North Carolina A deceptive forecast The rain ought to help incumbent Sen Lauch Faircloth but it actually favors Democratic challenger John Edwards Showers are expected only in the western half of the state which is especially conservative The rain could suppress Republican turnout in the west without lowering Democratic turnout in the center of the state Edwards scores an upset The updated forecast suggests it will rain across the entire state suppressing Democratic turnout too This will help Faircloth win South Carolina As in North Carolina the election could hang on how far east it rains Northwestern South Carolina the only part of the state that s supposed to get rain is heavily Republican If this forecast holds Republicans upstate may stay home but Democrats in the southeast won t Democratic Sen Fritz Hollings should hold his seat and gubernatorial candidate Jim Hodges should upset Republican Gov David Beasley If it rains across the whole state Republican Bob Inglis could go to the Senate and Beasley could keep the governorship More bad news for Democrats Tuesday s forecast calls for rain across the state Beasley and Inglis benefit Georgia Showers over the entire state will deter Democrats Republican incumbent Sen Paul Coverdell and Republican gubernatorial candidate Guy Millner will win their tight races It stops raining in the western half of the state perhaps raising turnout in Democratic Atlanta Kentucky A bitter pill for Democratic Senate candidate Scotty Baesler who has been running even against Republican Jim Bunning Bunning s campaign manager was quoted on Monday saying that if it rains we win Forecast rain across the state Republicans pick up a Senate seat Nevada Dry and warm as always This will slightly help Democratic incumbent Sen Harry Reid in his tossup race with Rep John Ensign California Clear weather throughout the state keeps turnout high and aids Democratic Sen Barbara Boxer and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Gray Davis They win easily Rain in Northern California could cut Democratic turnout This may lead Republican Senate challenger Matt Fong and gubernatorial candidate Dan Lungren to upset victories Washington News flash It s not going to rain in Seattle Turnout in the Democratic city will be heavy and Sen Patty Murray will hold off Republican challenger Linda Smith Oops Now it is supposed to rain in Seattle Wisconsin Cold but dry which should give a small boost to Democratic Sen Russ Feingold And the wild card pick Illinois Sen Carol Moseley Braun has been rising in the polls but she still seems to trail Republican challenger Peter Fitzgerald Good news for Moseley Braun in USA Today Chicago her stronghold will have dry weather and heavily Republican downstate Illinois will be soaked She holds her seat against all expectations The new forecast says Chicago weather will be dismal just as bad as it is downstate Sorry Carol We promise that these Slate predictions are just as reliable as the weather forecasts they re based on
