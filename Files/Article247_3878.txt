 Embarrassment of Riches Michael Lewis The New New Thing is the best book ever written about Silicon Valley There I ve said it Said it to you wondering to be sure whether you agree do you said it to the readers of Slate but most of all I ve said it to myself Michael Lewis The New New Thing is the best book ever written about Silicon Valley There I ve said it again I suspect I ll be saying it a few more times before our back and forth is finished three days hence From my point of view the reason for keeping this central truth front and center at all times is that the book s flaws are the kind that tend to drive me completely batty And so my natural tendency is going to be to harp on what he s done wrong rather than what he s done right And what he has done right is something big and important He has absolutely captured what Silicon Valley is like at this moment in history how crazy it is how the old rules have been turned upside down how it is filled with the sense that anything is possible and that everyone will soon be rich if they aren t already You would think other people would have done this by now but they haven t And that is because very few people have Lewis ability to capture something deep with a few deftly written scenes There is a wonderful scene for instance that comes shortly after the book s central character Jim Clark decides to start a health care Web site eventually named Healtheon Now the first point of course is that Clark doesn t really have a clue what this company is going to do Doesn t matter The venture capitalists are practically pleading with him to be allowed to invest in it Then he goes out and hires one person an engineer he knew back at Silicon Graphics which he also founded That night the engineer goes home only to find that his fax machine is already overflowing with r sum s from all the other engineers who want in not even caring what the company will do All they know is that it s an Internet startup headed by Jim Clark the man with the magic touch as Lewis describes him and that s all they need to know And then after that engineer has hired a handful of his buddies to start the company they fly to Boston to meet with the bureaucrats at Blue Cross Blue Shield to explain how they re going to transform the health care system Which they know nothing about We sat up all night reading all this literature about health care Lewis quotes one Healtheon employee as saying We asked What s the problem we are going to solve here Even more amazing Clark by then has largely wandered off After all his job in his view is to come up with an idea however unformed and then cause money and people to coalesce around it The trick Lewis writes in one of those wonderful Michael Lewis sentences was for Healtheon to get itself designated by the financial markets as the Official Health Care Sponsor of the Miracle Economy For this Clark reaps billions once the IPO takes place as it inevitably does and gets to be viewed as great Silicon Valley visionary It s all quite mind boggling and as I say I really think Lewis has done a terrific job rendering this new world in all its insane particulars There is another scene I feel compelled to mention the one in which the investment bankers and the company executives meet to decide about taking Healtheon public that is by itself worth the price of the book And now please allow me to gripe for a few minutes Is it possible that Michael Lewis has too much talent for his own good After reading this book I think it is and that s what made me so nuts as I was reading The New New Thing There is no problem he can t solve no hole he can t fill with a graceful turn of the phrase But that also means that when confronted with the choice between doing a little extra digging and writing his way around a problem he chooses the latter every time The thing that struck me particularly in this regard was Healtheon s IPO The original IPO was canceled because at the time it was scheduled to take place the market was tanking and the company s road show had been a bust But then some months later Healtheon goes public and is a huge success What happened in the interim We have no idea because Lewis never bothers to tell us All he says is No one asked how a company the stock market deemed unworthy was now suddenly desirable It just happened Well that may be nice writing but it s pretty unsatisfying journalism In fact I don t know if you noticed or not but Lewis never once explains what Healtheon is supposed to do It is supposed to somehow insert itself in the system but how Lewis has a lot of fun showing how fuzzy the concept is at the beginning but by the end of the book Healtheon is an actual company with an actual product that does what exactly I couldn t begin to tell you Of course maybe the problem is that this book was written with great haste There seems to be a belief among publishers that if you don t get your Silicon Valley book out fast it will be outdated before it s published And maybe they re right What do you think And what do you think of the amount of time Lewis lingers over Clark s damn boat I ll be happy to tell you what I think about that tomorrow though I guess I ve already tipped my hand
