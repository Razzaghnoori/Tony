                     Hi my name is Alexis Manser         I was born in  in Warren OH         My family is actually from Niles OH and Im half Lebanese from my fathers side and half German on my mothers side         Um when I was young my the story that stands out most in my mind is this story that my dad would tell me that he learned from I think it was one of his uncles Uncle Joe or Uncle Johnny         And um it was a story about this character named Jehilehi         And this is obviously just some made up name my uh great uncle came up with but and my my dad loved these stories as a child himself and related them to me when I was a kid         And                     Sorry can I just ask you how old you were when you heard these stories                     Ah         Well I guess my dad started telling me these stories when I was about three four up until whenever still I mean sometimes hell be joking around at the dinner table and still tell me these stories         But um and the thing was Jehilehi was this hero this brave guy and he had this motorcycle         And         he he would always be saving a woman from some bear or something or some some some wild creature         And he would you know at the climax of the story my dad would you know the stories were always varied and they were improvised never the same plot but he would you know get on his motorcycle and speed away into the mountains and fight this bear and save the damsel in distress and they were just pretty exciting stories especially when you are a kid you know         And then um my mom I remember her         She would read me a lot of books actually and and she would sing me a lot of songs         She wouldnt actually make up stories out of the blue but um and the songs that she would sing um I cant remember the name of this one but I always remember it was about         I sort of remember the words but she told me them when I was very little like I dont know like four or five maybe even younger and it was always about how um her and my dad loved me so much and there was always I dont know         See there was candy in the story         I just remember like it about it was being about candy and sweetness stuff like this         Uh sorry Im being vague but and um she would read me um a lot of Grimms fairy tales often and the one I remember most is um the one about the oh what was it the one with the hang on a second                     Hansel and Gretel                     I now recall the stories she would read to me         It was the one about the girl the dancing shoes or something like this these princesses had uh cast a spell cast on them and they had to dance all night with these shoes and until the shoes wore out and their feet were all sore         And then finally I I forget how the story went but I always remember her reading me this one story and I just loved it         And she oh well this this I guess both my parents imparted to me was this this album they that we used to have         It was um actually the story of Hansel and Gretel and they I think I would like listen to it everyday because I just loved it and they would put it on the record player and ah I would sit in a little rocking chair that we had in our living room and listen to it and I was kind of scared at the part where the witch was going to put them in the oven but          and my dad would come in and hed sit with me and comfort me         But I loved it so much even though it was scary to me I dont know why but um and also actually my grandma which I call Situ and thats grandma in Arabic         She um told me stories about when she was young         When I was a kid I would ask her like you know where where she grew up and what it was like in her neighborhood and she would tell me that oh when she was little that all of her cousins and all of her she had a big family her sisters and brothers and stuff         They all lived on the same street in Youngstown OH         And back then Youngstown supposedly she tells me was a much nicer place than it is these days         You know crime capital of the world         But um she she would tell me about how the kind of trouble they would get into and and how strict her parents were         And if she she would go to the store and buy them bread         And one day she went to buy them bread and she came back with the incorrect change and so her dad got very angry with her and made her go back to the store and and I guess the guy had given her too much money back and she hadnt told him that he had made a mistake and so she got in trouble way way too much trouble you know unnecessary trouble and she had to walk all the way back to the store and I dont know she just made it out that to seem like in a lot of ways back then times were seemed so much better and yet so much harsher in a lot of ways         And supposedly you know it snowed more back then and ah but you know family was closer knit I guess so you know pros and cons in every every case but and my my grandpa called Jidu in Arabic         He told me stories about when he was in the war he flew a fighter jet and he well when I was young he never really got much into the details being as I was little kid but he would tell me um about the buddies he met um during the war and some of the turmoil and stress it caused him and um my family on my dads side as I guess you can tell now is obviously a lot closer than on my moms side ah because my grandparents on my dads side well his parents had more kids than my moms parents did and and also my moms ah parents died when I was too young really to remember anything they would have said         Um so so also um my dads sister and brothers they spent a lot of time with me when I was little and they they made up little tales about         my my dad has has a very imaginative and inventive kind of family and they would always be making up these characters and telling me stories about them         Like Fred Fredimecusson and um Connie Connie Bujane and um         um          oh lets see Ralph Rasselbossum and                     And how old were you when they told you these stories                     Well I was the age at which they told me stories just it varied         I mean it was really pretty much all through my childhood you know up until I reached a certain age to where I didnt find it so interesting anymore but um I guess it would be somewhere under  or  that they would tell me these stories and um it usually would be at night and wed be back in this little bedroom I always would sleep in         And when Id stay the night at my grandparents house itd be a holiday and all the aunts and uncles of mine would be at the house and they were always very loving and and you know actually um some of the stories I remember very much so were the ones that my Uncle Dave would tell me         Wed wed build a bonfire outside because my grandparents they lived out in the country and wed build a bonfire and he would always tell these scariest ghost stories and he would make everyone of them up and they were so incredibly intricate         The plots I just I just remember just being so well told         We would sit around the fireplace my cousin Matt and my cousin Jamie and Jeremy and he would tell me these stories about you know this boyfriend and girlfriend         I remember this one where one day they were um they were driving down the road and actually I think this one might be a generic tale but uh um they went to a gas station or something and the guy gets out of the car to pump gas and the girls been sitting in there but its been a while         So she looks around for him in the parking lot and she doesnt see him and shes worried you know         Because hes spent you know going on minutes and minutes now         And um so she gets out of the car to find him and the gas station attendant runs out of the the um the gas station and he tells her not to get back in her car         Hes like yelling at her Dont get in your car         Dont get in your car          And shes shes scared because this guys all frantic and so she runs around and gets in the drivers side and she decides to drive off         Well shes driving down the road and she going down this dark country road         And he said the name of it was Duck Creek Road which was actually a road that my grandparents lived on         Hes trying to scare us even more         And the girl the girl um stops underneath this tree to catch her breath shes really nervous and scared         She doesnt know where her boyfriend is and she hears this after a little while shes sitting with her head on the steering wheel she she she hears this thumping on the top of the car                     Sorry can you just give me one second                              So she gets out to check what this noise is and shes shes looking on the car she sees nothing and so finally she sort of warily looks up and sees her boyfriend hanging from a tree limb and his leg is brushing against the top of the car and shes shes so obviously scared at this point         She screams she runs down the road just to get as far away from the scene as she can and honestly after that I dont remember what happens but something         happens         And anyways the point is my my uncle told these stories so much better and he he just the way he talked and the way he enunciated certain words and the way and the level and pitch at which he would speak was just he was amazing         So uh thank you thank you for this time for listening to me ramble about my stories         I hope you have a wonderful wonderful day         Thank you         Good Bye
