 Background Proteorhodopsin is a 249 amino acid membrane protein native to several uncultured species of proteobacteria which are a component of marine plankton 1 Addition of retinal to E coli expressing pR was shown to cause a reddish coloration of the bacteria with an absorption maximum near 520 nm The pR contained in the bacterial membranes was shown to act as a light activated proton pump but only when retinal is present Time resolved UV vis studies at pH 8 also revealed that the protein undergoes a photocycle similar to that of wild type bacteriorhodopsin but with a predominance of the O intermediate instead of M The bR photocycle has been characterized by spectroscopic methods as having six principal photointermediates bR K L M N and O Each intermediate has a distinct absorbance maximum the most studied are bR 570 nm M 412 nm and O 640 nm since these are the ones that can be produced in the highest concentration at physiological pH values Monitoring of the absorbance at individual wavelengths after photoexcitation is used to determine the relative concentrations and decay times of each of these photointermediates The L M transition in bR is characterized by the deprotonation of the Schiff base to Asp 85 producing the distinctive 412 nm absorbance maximum of M and by so called fast proton release the ejection of a proton from a different unknown residue into the external medium on the 10 100 s time scale depending on pH Reprotonation of the Schiff base from Asp 96 occurs during the M N transition with an absorbance maximum of 560 nm 2 The N O transition involves the reprotonation of the Asp 96 from the cytoplasmic space Like bR pR consists of seven transmembrane helices that include in the membrane interior all of the residues conserved among archaeal rhodopsin proton pumps In particular analogues of Asp 85 Asp96 Arg 82 and Lys 216 of bR are present in pR Conspicuously absent are analogues for Glu 194 and Glu 204 of bR The latter as well as Arg 82 have been implicated in fast proton release In particular mutagenesis of Glu 194 or Glu 204 in bR results in loss of fast proton release 3 4 The absence of homologs for these residues in pR leaves open the question of whether it carries out fast H release Experiments described here demonstrate that pR does indeed undergo fast H release at least under elevated pH conditions that resemble somewhat those of the proteobacteria s native open ocean environment We also demonstrate that there is a post translational modification of at least one of the three native cysteines when pR is expressed in E coli Both of these discoveries were made possible through purification methods for pR described herein Results Purification PR was obtained in 85 purity assuming that values of 280 and 546 for pR are the same as for bR solubilized in DMPC cholate SDS mixtures at pH 8 280 7 85 10 4cm 1M 1and 551 4 8 10 4cm 1M 1 5 This assumption is actually expected to underestimate the purity of pR produced by up to 20 since the pR we expressed has 10 tryptophan and 14 tyrosine residues as compared to 8 tryptophans and 11 tyrosines in bR from H salinarum The absorbance of contaminant proteins was assumed to be 1 1 for a 1 mg mL solution By using these assumptions the relative concentrations of pR and other proteins can be determined from the absorbance spectra of the various fractions fig 1 The resulting purity values correlate well with those Coomasie stained SDS PAGE gels see below The OG extract of cholate washed membrane pellets starts out at a pR content of 7 total protein w w The Phenylsepharose column increases the purity level to 24 with approximately 5 loss The final purification step by hydroxylapatite column chromatography produces pR with 85 purity and a further loss of 60 i e the overall yield of the two column procedure was 30 Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Relative to protein standards the apparent molecular weight of bR is 25 000 while the apparent molecular weights of pR wt and pR TCM are 36 000 and 31 000 respectively fig 2 lanes E and C respectively SDS PAGE fig 2 also confirms the estimates of purity level based on the assumed 280 546 ratio identical with that of detergent solubilized bR Interestingly the pR appears to be a doublet band whose relative concentrations remain almost unchanged during purification This doublet is also present in the less purified sample of pR TCM with both bands shifted down by approximately the same amount fig 2 lane C Subsequent SDS PAGE analysis of pR samples that had been stored for periods of time up to several months indicate that after sitting for several weeks in octylglucoside solution at 4 C the largest post translational modification on wild type pR is eliminated presumably hydrolysed off of the cysteine s leaving only a 31 000 MW band indistinguishable from that seen for pR TCM data not shown Furthermore after boiling for several min in gel loading solution this cleaved wild type protein as well as the TCM both give an extra artifactual band near 36 000 dalton The latter band a singlet is coincidentally at almost the same apparent MW as the doublet from the uncleaved post translationally modified wild type pR fig 2 lane E These potential artifacts should be taken into consideration in any attempt to reproduce the results in Fig 2 Photocycle kinetics and flash induced proton concentration changes Photocycle kinetics were measured at 400 500 and 580 nm in the presence of the short chain lipid DHPC This lipid does not support the formation of closed bilayer vesicles but rather forms micelles like a detergent The time resolved measurements showed no positive 400 nm absorbance signals at pH 8 0 or lower Fig 3 This is somewhat in disagreement with B j et al 1 who detected small 400 nm transient absorbance increases upon photolysis at pH 8 0 However we observed a transient 400 nm absorbance increase at an elevated pH of 9 5 fig 3 At pH 9 5 in the presence of DHPC and observing transient changes at 500 nm fig 4 pR undergoes a 2 phase decay after the initial unresolved absorbance decrease Multiexponential fits show that the first decay phase has a time constant of 4 s in good agreement with the 4 s rise time of the 400 nm signal Fig 4 The amplitude of this decay represents about 80 of the initial absorbance depletion The second phase of the 500 nm absorbance decay occurs with a substantially slower time constant of 0 5 s returning the remaining 20 of initial absorbance change The slowest decay components of the positive 400 nm signal and the negative 500 nm signal follow similar kinetics although the amplitudes of these components differ by a factor of 3 At pH 9 5 the 580 nm trace has no significant positive values indicative of an O like intermediate although in agreement with earlier measurements 1 at lower pH values a red shifted transient is the predominant positive absorbance signal data not shown Figure 5shows a different type of time resolved measurement probing not the pR chromophore but rather pH changes in the protein environment Proton concentration changes in the aqueous bulk phase were measured with the pH sensitive dye cresol red which has a pK a of 8 2 8 5 The bottom trace in Figure 5shows the absorbance change of the indicator during the pR photocycle The negative signal is indicative of a pH decrease corresponding to transient H release from the protein into the solution The best fit time constant for the release phase is 6 s The positive 400 nm trace in fig 5 reproduced from fig 3 shows that the proton release and uptake follow kinetics very similar to the apparent formation and decay of M as is typically seen in bR near neutral pH 6 7 21 However no proton release signal could be observed for pR at pH 6 or 8 data not shown Discussion Purification of pR Meaningful comparison of intrinsic physiological properties of pR and bR depends on the purification of pR The E coli expression system can easily be used to prepare pR at 85 purity with similar or less effort and time than required for bR purple membrane production from S9 H salinarum The initial purity level of the OG solubilized cholate extracted membrane is about 7 pR by weight Phenylsepharose column chromatography separates proteins on the basis of hydrophobicity and has been used previously in hR purification 8 9 10 As an initial purification step the Phenylsepharose column achieved a substantial increase in protein purity to 25 along with removal of most of the lipid The final purification step utilizing a hydroxylapatite column has been previously used with rhodopsin 11 This column proved to be more efficient as a final step in the purification than as a preliminary one because large amounts of contaminant protein tended to slow the flow rate drastically This step of the purification yielded an increase in protein purity to 85 The overall yield of pR from membrane through the column purifications is 30 Most of this loss 65 occurs during the hydroxylapatite column Molecular weight differences B j et al reported a molecular weight for wild type pR of 27 kDa based on the predicted amino acid sequence of the protein 1 Its 249 amino acids barely exceed the 248 of mature bR which has a molecular weight of 26 000 However we observed a significantly higher apparent molecular weight 36 000 for wild type pR on SDS PAGE gels Fig 2 lanes D and E Post translational modification of pR must almost certainly account for some of the observed molecular weight difference between pR and bR Lipids or sugars covalently bound to the protein surface would not be removed during the purification procedure and could cause a higher apparent molecular weight Cysteines are frequently a site of lipid association with membrane proteins e g mammalian rhodopsin which has two palmitoyl molecules attached to cysteine residues Therefore we compared the SDS PAGE gel mobility of wild type pR to that of a cys less mutant pR TCM The elimination of the three possible sulfhydryl attachment sites lowers the apparent molecular weight of the pR TCM by 5 000 Fig 2 lane C From this we conclude that at least one of the three cysteines in pR is probably modified post translationally However this by itself does not account fully for the anomalous mobility of pR on SDS PAGE gels because pR TCM is still approximately 5 000 higher in molecular weight than bR according to SDS PAGE fig 2 lanes A C Only 2 600 of this can be accounted for by the V5 eiptope and poly histidine tail that are appended to the C terminus of pR by the pBAD TOPO expression vector that we used 1 There is undoubtedly a further post translational modification of unknown nature Spectral comparisons B j et al reported an absorbance maximum for pR of 520 nm in E coli membranes using a difference bleaching technique to remove interfering absorbance bands from other membrane components in the impure pR sample 1 We confirmed this result using crude E coli membranes without detergent present data not shown However we observed an absorbance maximum of 546 5 nm for pR in OG at pH 7 at all stages of purification Fig 1 Small blue shifts were observed for pR samples in OG when measured at pH 8 and 9 5 8 and 16 nm respectively data not shown For the pR samples reconstituted in DHPC which were used for flash photolysis experiments the absorbance maxima were similar to those measured in OG spectra not shown A chromophore absorption maximum near 540 nm was also obtained by using difference spectroscopy of pR in crude E coli membranes solubilized in OG spectrum not shown However for pR measured directly in crude E coli membranes i e not solubilized in OG we obtained the same value 520 nm as reported previously 1 Solubilization in detergent presumably leads to structural distortions of the native protein conformation and therefore a change in the absorbance properties of the chromophore However the direction that max for pR would have to shift upon solubilization in OG is inconsistent with the pattern for bR whose max decreases when it is solubilized in OG 12 Furthermore pR in OG showed resonance Raman spectra D Dunmire R A Krebs and M S Braiman unpublished data indicative of a chromophore structure very close to native light adapted i e all trans bR in purple membrane However there is one major difference pR in OG exhibits an upshifted doublet C N Schiff base band consisting of two components of nearly equal intensity These appear to correspond to the presence of two distinct subpopulations of pR at least when expressed in E coli and solubilized in OG micelles The different values of max for pR in membrane state 1 and OG solution might be related to the presence of these multiple subpopulations but this connection remains unclear Principal photointermediates of pR Of the six principal photointermediates present in bR four can be discerned from the time dependent visible absorbance traces from pR in fig 4 along with previously published time traces at 600 nm 1 the resting state pR M N and O The resting state with an absorbance maximum of 546 nm see above provides the baseline spectrum for the difference time courses reported The M intermediate of bR has an unprotonated Schiff base group giving rise to a blue shifted max 400 nm Likewise in pR an increase in the 400 nm absorbance should indicate formation of a deprotonated Schiff base and therefore the presence of an M like intermediate Interpretation of the 500 nm time course trace is more complicated As in bR it likely involves decay of M to N as well as from N back to bR The absorbance maximum of the N intermediate in bR is 560 nm corresponding to a protonated Schiff base This is not very different from max for the resting state of pR 546 nm The likely spectral overlap between pR and its own postulated N photoproduct complicates the determination of amounts of each that are present The slow 500 ms decay observed in both the 400 nm and 500 nm time courses indicates an equilibrium between the M and N intermediates that remains until pR returns to its initial resting state B j et al reported a strong positive 580 nm transient absorbance increase in suspensions of membranes prepared from E coli expressing pR 1 This positive absorbance difference is indicative of O intermediate formation We looked for its presence in partially purified samples reconstituted in DHPC in the pH range 6 11 Data are shown only at pH 9 5 see Fig 4 Our observations at pH 9 5 do not show any evidence of O intermediate formation Fig 4 Only at lower pH values was a clear positive 580 nm absorption change observed data not shown This is in agreement with results on bR for which O formation is also enhanced at lower pH values and becomes small or nearly unobservable in the alkaline range Dependence of the M intermediate on pH Deprotonation of the Schiff base linkage of the retinal and Lys 216 is dependent on its pK a which changes between photointermediate states The Schiff base readily undergoes deprotonation in the M intermediate However no M intermediate formation occurs below a pH of 9 figure 3 instead the O intermediate predominates 1 Predominance of O at lower pH values is also observed in bR However in bR the M intermediate is detectable at low and high pHs but has a longer lifetime at higher pH due to a long lived equilibrium between M and another intermediate N 13 It seems likely that an N intermediate of pR is similarly in equilibrium with its M intermediate based on the fact that the transient positive 400 nm absorbance increase is smaller than the negative 500 nm bleach and the time course at 500 nm shows a partial return to baseline on a timescale of 50 s The difference in pH dependence between the pR and bR photocycles can likely be attributed to differences in the microenvironment of the Schiff base and is perhaps related to absence of Glu194 204 in pR These adaptive differences presumably optimize the proteins to operate at maximum efficiency in the niches that their respective organisms occupy In the case of the proteobacteria which in the open ocean pH 7 8 8 0 occupy a signficantly more alkaline environment than halobacteria perhaps the proton release group is simply not under any evolutionary pressure to be capable of deprotonating in the M state at neutral pH In this view the principal role of E194 and E204 in bR may to modulate the pK a of the H release group in the M state to a value lower than the pH of the organism s external environment Fast proton release in pR Under the same conditions where M is observed pH 9 5 and in 1 DHPC pR undergoes fast proton release during its photocycle Fig 5 The pH indicator dye Cresol Red was used to detect pH changes in the bulk aqueous phase These turn out to be similar to those observed for bR in the pH range 5 5 10 After photoexcitation pR like bR presumably ejects a H from a residue near its extracellular surface decreasing the pH of the solution When the N O transition takes place in bR H is taken up from the medium raising the pH once again The H signals from pR measured with Cresol Red occur on a time scale similar to that assignable to M and N decay returning to baseline about 1 s after photolysis There is a clear kinetic correlation between M and or N intermediate formation and fast H release in pR The linkage between these two phenomena is further supported by the observation that neither a transient 400 nm absorbance increase nor fast H release is shown to occur at pH 8 0 and below Nor is either observed in the absence of a reconstituting lipid DHPC in these experiments In bR the ejected proton is thought to originate from a triad of amino acids R82 E194 E204 However in pR a homolog of only one of these three residues the arginine is present This raises doubts about previous conclusions regarding the specific roles of these 3 residues in fast H proton release in both pR and bR In particular the apparently obligatory roles of E204 and E194 in fast H release in bR are not matched in pR Therefore even in bR it is less likely that these groups themselves change protonation state between bR and M to provide the H released to the bulk medium Instead it now seems more likely that E204 and E194 merely help to lower the pK a of the H release group from above 8 the apparent value for pR into the vicinity of 6 for bR It also seems very unlikely that the specific structural configuration of 2 carboxylic acid groups and arginine in bR could be conserved in pR even if as suggested previously 1 other surface carboxylic acids in pR could substitute in some ways for the roles of E194 and E204 in bR The only way that the H release mechanism can be strongly conserved between bR and pR is if arginine itself serves as the principal donor group for fast H release in both with nearby residues such as E194 and E204 merely modulating the pK a of the arginine in the M intermediate However it remains unclear how the pK a of Arg 82 in bR could be made sufficiently low in its M intermediate to serve as the H release group at pH values down to 6 0 Alternatively it is possible that the fast H release we observe from pR at pH 9 5 may differ from that in bR One possibility is that in pR the released proton could come directly from the chromophore counterion Asp 97 This would be consistent with a proposed mechanism for fast H release that has been observed above pH 10 in the bR mutant E194Q 14 In this mutant Asp 85 was detected by low temperature infrared difference spectroscopy to be deprotonated only in the N intermediate and not in M 15 It is not clear yet whether Asp 85 deprotonation in an N like state could account for the proton release kinetics of pR Fig 5 or whether the M intermediate itself might have a partially deprotonated Asp 85 The reason for the requirement of DHPC in M intermediate formation and fast proton release is unclear Delipidated bR in octylglucoside is fully capable of M formation and presumably proton release although with altered kinetics 12 16 The requirement for pR to be in lipid to show fast H release and M formation stems either from a protein lipid interaction needed to establish a stable active tertiary structure or from the need for the phosphate group in DHPC to act as a proton release group The latter seems unlikely due to the DHPC molecule being zwitterionic at pH 9 5 with no proton on the trimethyl modified nitrogen of the choline Hence the DHPC most likely interacts with the protein to effect minor structural changes needed to place the active site residues in their functional configuration Conclusions A comparison of the primary sequences of pR and bR at first glance seems as to preclude fast H release as part of the proton pumping mechanism of pR due to the absence of residues analogous to Glu194 and Glu 204 of bR However fast H release is indeed observed in pR under conditions where an M intermediate is formed Glu194 and Glu 204 in bR play a role in fast H release that is apparently not required for the mechanism of the bR family of proton transporters It is therefore necessary to conclude that either the H release groups in pR and bR are non homologous surface carboxylic acid residues as suggested previously 1 or else that a conserved non carboxylic acid residue i e Arg82 94 or Asp85 97 is the H release group in pR The higher pH requirement for the M intermediate of pR presumably corresponds with adaptation to the more alkaline oceanic environment in which the proteobacteria are found The necessity of reconstituting pR with some lipid before it is capable of photocycling shows that the presence of lipids facilitates pR in assuming its fully active structure E coli expressed pR has post translational modifications including 4000 daltons of substituents at one or more of its three cysteines Such post translational modifications might also play a role in explaining the different physiological properties of pR and bR Materials methods Protein expression and detergent extraction Proteorhodopsin was expressed by E
