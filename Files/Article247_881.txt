 The Lovely Linda She can t dance She can t sing but she s got to be a part of that pop music thing The words of Marshall Crenshaw who once played John Lennon in Beatlemania came to mind this afternoon with the news of the death of Linda McCartney For most of the 1970s Linda was one of the most universally ridiculed figures in pop music her shortcomings as a singer and musician all too vivid on Paul s records and especially his tours In the 80s one wag got his hands on a soundboard tape of Linda s microphone during a performance of Hey Jude and radio stations put its one flat note into heavy rotation That combined with the image of Linda as groupie in shutterbug s clothing conjured up by an infamous piece from the Clay Felker era at the Village Voice established Linda as a figure of almost singular unpopularity the almost courtesy of Yoko Ono who in the public s addled mind bore the added stigma of breaking up the Beatles Why this should be when it wasn t her idea to join Wings in the first place and when by all available evidence she kept Paul McCartney wildly happy and with him raised a flock of spirited children whose achievements are beginning to come to light Had she been born 20 years earlier she would have been the decorative spouse who kept the creator satisfied as she gave him a stable home two decades later she d have been Baby Spice with a brain Courtney Love on speaking terms with her biological father Paula Abdul as a photographer instead of a choreographer Paul now becomes the odds on favorite for next year s Album of the Year Grammy but it s worth noting that the Big Moments in his life John s death in particular have not brought out the best in him For 30 years now audiences hoped he d serve up wrenching emotional music his version of Mother from Plastic Ono Band and it just doesn t seem to be in his nature All the same the critical re assessment of Paul is already upon us and Linda s death will speed things along That assessment will overrate Paul s post Beatles output in particular I m guessing the music he makes next just as Tug of War was overrated in the wake of John s murder and underrate his work in the Beatles an explosion of pop craftsmanship without precedence overshadowed by Lennon s mediagenic personality and subsequent martyrdom I feel like in couple of months it ll be safe for me once more to admit that Paul was my favorite Beatle Bitch Bitch Bitch I ve always been grateful to Elizabeth Wurtzel for teaching me the meaning of the word Schadenfreude It was a concept that came up a lot in the days immediately following Tina Brown s installation as editor at The New Yorker as many journalists of my acquaintance gleefully counted down the moments until Wurtzel was deposed as pop music critic Her writing since certainly confirms that rock n roll was not her ideal subject but the idea that the value of her provocative thoughts is somehow debased by her candor about her personal life or by her willingness to appear topless on the cover of her book is hilarious In case you missed it that battle was fought in the 80s and Madonna won So get over it My first and only conversation with Wurtzel during a sort of job interview placed her on my short list of Fluff Folders right alongside Warren Beatty and Diane Sawyer Fluff Folders are people so charming on first meeting that if one were to ask me Can you do my laundry tonight my only response would be Fluff fold A Magazine About Nothing There s plenty of buckshot being sprayed at Lynn Hirschberg and Vanity Fair in the wake of l affaire Seinfeld in which the sitcom icon obtained a pre publication copy of a VF story being written about him VF says their investigation indicates the Hirschberg gave Seinfeld the piece herself Hirschberg denies the charge Believe whom you will but it s Jerry who behaved most caddishly by reading a yet to close story about himself requesting corrections firing his publicist and afterwards his stated pleasure in the story notwithstanding leaving both writer and magazine twisting in the wind publicly by not taking the blame for wanting to check out the piece in advance Like he doesn t know that s against the rules Chris Connelly
