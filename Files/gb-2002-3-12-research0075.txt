 Background Aneuploidy is a common feature of cancer Genetic alterations such as amplification deletion translocation and rearrangement could result in either gain of function or loss of function mutations in genes that modulate aspects of cell proliferation differentiation motility and survival Whereas cytogenetic profiling techniques such as comparative genomic hybridization CGH 1 have been useful in finding genetic abnormalities other experimental approaches are frequently used to identify which specific gene s drive selection for the genetic aberration and contribute most to tumor progression Common gene identification techniques include determining if a candidate gene contains a sequence mutation and or determining if the candidate gene or gene product is abnormally expressed As mutation analysis and protein expression studies are time consuming increasingly high throughput gene expression profiling is being used to identify abnormally expressed genes within a region of cytogenetic change 2 3 4 5 6 Recently several groups have observed that chromosomal changes can lead to regional biases in gene expression values both in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in human tumors and tumor derived cell lines 2 3 7 8 These studies suggest that a fraction of gene expression values 15 25 are regulated in concordance with gene dosage A computational technique termed comparative genomic microarray analysis CGMA has previously been used to identify regions of allelic imbalance indirectly from gene expression profiles of human tumors 8 CGMA predicts chromosomal amplifications and deletions by organizing gene expression data by genomic mapping location and scanning for regions that contain a statistically significant number of gene expression values that change in the same relative direction In this study we apply CGMA analysis to a large hepatocellular carcinoma microarray dataset to demonstrate its validity as an alternative to CGH and to identify candidate genes in regions of frequent cytogenetic change Primary liver cancer in adults is the sixth most common form of cancer and the fourth leading cause of death from cancer worldwide 9 10 Through the examination of hepatitis B virus HBV and hepatitis C virus HCV induced tumors two landmark CGH studies have suggested that a subset of cytogenetic changes frequently occurs in HCC 11 12 These include frequent gain of chromosomes 1q 6p 8q 17q and 20q and frequent loss of chromosomes 1p 4q 6q 8p 13 16 and 17p 11 12 In particular gain of chromosomes 1q and 8q has been associated with the early development of HCC 12 whereas loss of chromosome 4q has been linked to increased aggressiveness of established tumors 11 To determine whether gene expression data could be used to identify cytogenetic changes accurately we applied CGMA to a microarray dataset of HCC tumors and compared the CGMA predictions to existing CGH data For HCC CGMA was able to predict nearly all chromosomal aberrations identified previously by CGH In addition from the gene expression data we also identified a set of genes whose expression values change most within the regions of cytogenetic change These genes may represent candidate genes whose expression changes drive selection for chromosomal gains or losses Results CGMA predictions of cytogenetic changes Normalized log transformed gene expression data from 104 HCC gene expression arrays 13 were obtained from the Stanford Microarray Database 14 As CGMA analysis yields more intuitive predictions if the tumor expression data is compared to a normal tissue reference the original HCC gene expression data was mathematically transformed such that the pooled cell line reference was replaced by a normal tissue reference 3 see Materials and methods Using this transformation gene expression values from the tumor sample are compared to corresponding values from non cancerous tissue Genomic regions that contain a disproportionate number of genes that change expression in the same relative direction that is show a gene expression bias may indicate an underlying chromosomal gain or loss Figure 1a 2 3 7 8 Chromosomal regions that contained a gene expression bias with at least 95 confidence a sign test z statistic of at least 1 96 see Materials and methods were identified for all 104 HCC expression profiles Figure 1b In addition genomic regions that contained significant gene expression biases in at least 35 of non replicate samples were identified Figure 1c A 35 threshold was chosen because in previous CGMA profiling experiments this threshold yielded the highest CGMA to CGH agreement 8 and data not shown CGMA predicted frequent gains for chromosome 1q gained in 72 of tumor samples 6p 56 8q 49 17q 46 20q 46 5q 42 19P 37 and 12q 35 Frequent chromosomal losses were predicted for chromosome 4q lost in 66 of tumor samples 17p 48 13 39 16 37 and 8p 35 To determine if CGMA predictions were consistent with other cytogenetic profiling studies the CGMA data were compared with data from two of the largest CGH profiling studies 67 and 50 samples respectively using HCC tumors 11 12 Of the 13 regions detected by CGMA 10 77 were also implicated by CGH Figure 1c CGMA also detected three gained regions chromosomes 5q 12q and 19p which were not implicated in the CGH analysis CGMA failed to discover two regions of loss detected by CGH chromosomes 1p and 6q It is noteworthy that these particular losses were not identified in both CGH studies These data suggest that CGMA predictions produce results very similar to traditional CGH profiling studies Comparison to previous HCC studies To date there have been at least 20 reports on the application of CGH to HCC 11 12 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 To determine whether the differences between the CGMA predictions and the two large CGH studies were similar to the experimental variation observed between different HCC CGH studies predictions produced by CGMA were compared to 13 different HCC CGH profiling studies Figure 2 CGMA produced 10 of 13 77 predictions that matched a consensus chromosomal aberration profile On average each CGH study matched the consensus profile in 78 14 of the chromosomal regions analyzed Therefore the variation in CGMA results was similar to the variations between independent CGH studies These results suggest that CGMA profiling is able to predict regions of frequent chromosomal imbalance in HCC as well as CGH profiling As only 4 of the 104 4 samples analyzed scored positive for HCV infection we could not use this dataset to detect significant cytogenetic differences between HCV infected verses HBV infected individuals data not shown CGMA predictions of multifocal tumors Included in the set of HCC gene expression profiles were several cases in which multiple tumor nodules were removed from the same patient In some cases the nodules had related gene expression profiles patients HK63 HK64 HK66 whereas in other cases tumors from the same patient had distinctive profiles HK65 HK67 HK85 33 In particular in patient HK67 the gene expression profile from nodule HK67 1 was distinct from the expression profiles from nodules HK67 2 and HK67 3 33 Array CGH was used previously to determine the cytogenetic profiles of the tumor nodules from this patient 33 Array CGH identified common cytogenetic abnormalities in patient HK67 s tumors including loss of chromosome 15q an unusual gain of chromosome 19q and loss of the centromeric region of chromosome 22 However additional cytogenetic changes were found in tumors HK67 2 and HK67 3 that were not present in HK67 1 The cytogenetic profiling data coupled with the observation that HK67 2 and HK67 3 were both smaller in size and had an increased mitotic index suggested that HK67 1 was the primary tumor and HK67 2 and HK67 3 were divergent HK67 1 subclones To determine whether CGMA predictions agree with this monoclonal origin hypothesis CGMA profiles of patient HK67 s tumor nodules were isolated and organized by hierarchical clustering Figure 3 CGMA also detected the common chromosome 19q gain and chromosome 15q loss in the HK67 tumors CGMA did not identify a common loss on chromosome 22 however CGMA identified other genetic aberrations 8q 16q and 19q consistently found in the HK67 tumors CGMA also identified additional aberrations 2q 5q 12q present in H67 2 and H67 3 that were not found in H67 1 Taken together the CGMA data supports the hypothesis that the H67 2 and HK67 3 tumor nodules probably arose from HK67 1 but that additional distinct cytogenetic events had occurred in these nodules during tumor progression In contrast tumor nodules from patient HK64 have very similar gene expression profiles and very similar cytogenetic profiles as predicted by CGMA suggesting that these tumors have common origins and these nodules have not diverged significantly from the original lineage In addition tumor nodules from patient HK85 showed distinctive expression profiles and distinct HBV integration sites 33 Similarly the tumors from patient HK85 also show distinct CGMA predicted cytogenetic profiles reflecting the independent transforming mechanism Figure 3 Identification of candidate genes in regions of frequent cytogenetic change Frequent cytogenetic abnormalities suggest that tumor modifying genes oncogenes or tumor suppressors may be driving selection for the amplification or deletion of these particular genetic regions 6 11 12 34 35 36 An advantage of using CGMA profiling rather than traditional molecular genetic profiling is that access to gene expression data is inherent in the analysis CGMA allows cytogenetic analysis and the candidate gene approach to be performed with the same dataset For example the c myc oncogene has been postulated to drive selection for frequent chromosome 8q amplification Though c myc is located on a region that both CGMA and CGH identify as frequently gained c myc s expression is increased more than twofold in less than 6 of the samples In fact in 52 of the HCC tissue samples c myc s expression is downregulated Table 1 This implies that increased c myc expression is not driving the selection for the amplification of chromosomal region 8q in these samples In the small region of chromosome 8q presented in Table 1 two other genes for squalene monooxygenase and pro2000 do show increased expression in a majority of HCC samples Consistent with previous reports examining gene expression levels in regions of cytogenetic change expression levels for a large percentage of genes in this amplified region remain unchanged 3 5 8 The set of genes that are consistently misregulated in regions of frequent cytogenetic change as predicted by CGMA are shown in Table 2 Platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha is consistently downregulated in a region of frequent cytogenetic loss and this suggests that loss of a member of this receptor gene family is important in HCC progression It has previously been reported that a transcript PRLTS with sequence similarity to the extracellular domain of platelet derived growth factor receptor may also be a tumor suppressor for HCC 35 In addition consistently increased expression of the pituitary tumor transforming gene 1 oncogene PTTG is observed in these samples Table 2 PTTG maps to chromosome 5q a region that was identified as frequently changed by CGMA but not identified in the majority of CGH profiling studies PTTP overexpression in NIH 3T3 cells induces these cells to form tumors when injected into nude mice Overexpression of this gene may result from frequent chromosomal amplification and may participate in HCC tumor progression CGMA prediction software To assist in identifying regions of unidirectional gene expression bias we have constructed a web based program that processes two color gene expression data and identifies genomic regions that contain gene expression biases The input for this program is a simple tab delimited gene expression matrix file consisting of columns for the probe sequence identifier probe name and gene expression ratios Because different microarray technologies use different identifiers to describe the microarray probe the program translates probe sequence identifiers ids such as GenBank accession numbers and UniGene cluster ids to Ensembl transcript ids using precompiled sequence comparisons After data analysis a summary table is displayed showing chromosomal regions that show significant 0 05 unidirectional gene expression bias highlighted in either red or green indicating either increased or decreased expression biases respectively The program can also send several output files to the user via e mail These files include a summary report that contains the z statistic for each chromosomal region positive for upregulated regions and negative for downregulated regions and a list of genes located in regions of frequent cytogenetic change The program is available at 37 Discussion In this study we have used gene expression profiling data to predict cytogenetic changes that frequently occur in HCC Two landmark CGH analyses identified 12 different regions of frequent imbalance However one study found 8 regions and the other study found 11 11 12 Five of these 12 regions were not found in both experiments CGMA successfully identified 10 of 12 regions previously distinguished by CGH CGMA also detected three regions that have not been implicated by these CGH studies On average however 22 of genomic regions indentified in a particular HCC CGH study are not constantly identified in other studies Therefore the three inconsistent CGMA predictions 3 of 13 23 are comparable to the inconsistencies between independent CGH studies for HCC Three additional regions were identified by CGMA that were not identified by CGH While these CGMA predicted regions were near the 35 cutoff for detection they could represent other regions of allelic imbalance yet to be detected by CGH It is also possible that biological mechanisms other than cytogenetic change could influence expression in large genomic regions and produce regional gene expression biases Additional molecular genetic work will be required to resolve these differences If CGH data are not available for a particular cancer type but gene expression profiling data are then CGMA could allow rapid prediction of the cytogenetic abnormalities that frequently occur within that cancer type Moreover in instances where gene expression profiling reveals previously unrecognized cancer subtypes CGMA could determine whether cytogenetic differences are responsible for these different subtypes In cancer types where traditional cytogenetic profiling has already been carried out CGMA predictions could serve to confirm existing cytogenetic profiling data and be used further to examine candidate genes whose expression changes most within a region of frequent cytogenetic change In this way CGMA can be combined with the candidate gene approach to identify genes that are directly involved in tumor progression Conclusions CGMA can be used to indicate chromosomal imbalances by detecting chromosomal regions that contain a disproportionate number of gene expression values that change in the same relative direction This analysis provides good evidence that CGMA is a practical alternative to CGH cytogenetic profiling when gene expression profiling data is available Materials and methods Normalization and filtering Normalized log transformed gene expression data for 104 HCC samples and 76 corresponding non cancerous liver gene expression profiles 13 were obtained from the Stanford Microarray Database 14 Genes that were present in at least 75 of samples 10 037 genes were used for further analysis In this study both the tumor samples and normal tissue samples were compared to a pooled cell line reference 3 To allow comparison of tumor gene expression values to gene expression values from surrounding non cancerous tissue new gene expression ratios tumor verse normal T N were estimated To create the new ratios log transformed non cancerous tissue ratios N U were subtracted from the log transformed HCC tissue ratios T U for each gene such that log 2 T N log 2 T U log 2 N U If an HCC sample did not have a corresponding non cancerous sample the global mean of the non cancerous tissue gene expression ratios were used CGMA analysis To identify regional gene expression biases gene expression values that map within a given chromosomal arm were collected and a sign test for a one sample mean median was used to determine whether a significant upward or downward bias was present in the expression values An exception was made for chromosomes 13 16 21 and 22 These chromosomes are more telocentric and therefore only their q arms were tested for expression biases Sequence comparisons were used to map microarray probe sequences the sequences that are placed on the microarray to predicted Ensembl transcripts Ensembl version 6 28 8 Included in the Ensembl transcript annotations are chromosomal mapping locations at base pair resolution Redundancy introduced by replicate probes on the array and or multiple probes mapping to the same gene were eliminated by averaging expression values that map to identical transcripts Of the filtered set of 10 037 genes 6 274 genes 63 were unique and had associated genomic mapping information A sign test for the one sample mean median was used to determine whether a significant number of genes that map to a given chromosomal region change in a unidirectional manner The algorithm scores a gene as up or down regulated if the magnitude of the expression value change is at least 1 8 fold The sign test computes the probability in the form of a z statistic of finding x upregulated genes out of n genes that change in a given genomic region For simplicity the z statistic is computed using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution such that z 2 x n sqrt n Genomic regions that contained less than 15 changed gene expression values were excluded from further analysis On average 160 gene expression values were located to each genomic region The sign test z statistic can be converted to a significance value based on the two tailed z statistic z 2 critical values For example if z 1 96 then 0 05 if z 2 58 then 0 01 and so on
