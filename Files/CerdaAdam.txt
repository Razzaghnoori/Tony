 You re not going to hear yourself on the tape OK go ahead OK Adam is now going to talk about the music industry Go ahead Adam The music industry well you want more of the juicy sordid details Hold on OK go ahead The music industry I had a dream once of becoming a musician most specifically probably a producer slash rapper writer extraordinaire in the music business and all of my hopes and dreams were shattered once I actually got involved in the music industry Um specifically I guess more the recording aspect and dealing with the people that you have to deal with in the music industry on a day to day basis in that supposedly creative environment and um where to begin Let s see I started in the music industry when I was very young um as a DJ and How old were you My mother thought how old was I I was probably 12 or 13 years old My and I somehow managed to convince my my mother and stepfather of the time to uh get me a couple of turn tables and started mixing songs and scratching and doing all that D J stuff And uh it was cool and it went on like that for a while And uh as I continued I got more into actually making the music that people would I guess rap over and from there I hooked up with a few different people that were rappers if you will and and uh kind of developed my own interests in actually writing words and that sort a thing And this is I guess after after high school kind of right before college actually while I was in college before I went away to school while I was still in Brooklyn And so I was working with a few people anyway um went away to school and got more into it and managed to do a little business deal with a few friends of mine that enabled me to get some equipment to actually produce music on a more professional level And anyway uh anyway went on from there started doing a lot of stuff in college working with um one person specifically You can stop it Anyways where was I from that interruption Was working with somebody in college and um a kid by the name of Phil and uh you know we put a few demo tapes together and that kind a thing And he was more active in naturally shopping and and some some positive feedback But really what we were the subject matter and content probably was a bit far into the hip hop audience Um it seemed like we were more interested in kind of promoting a level of consciousness and most other people were interested in talking shit about gang banging you know the whole gangster rap thing and that got really big So NWA and some of the other Dr Dre and just some other people that were kind of involved in that So anyway so we uh got some response and and kind of adjusted things but after uh after a while we kind of went our separate ways I uh went off to do my thing and he went off to to some other things and uh anyway um to make a long story fairly short I got married and being married gave me a little bit of freedom as far as what I need to do to make money because my wife was working and making enough to support us So I was able to get out into the actual music industry the recording industry and unfortunately one aspect of the recording industry when you get started a lot of times you have to do either very low paying or non paying internships to get into the recording studio Specifically I mean if you want to work at work at one of these places they they uh generally have a lot of free help so uh you re not going to make a whole lot of money doing this and they expect you to put in a full time schedule so you really can t work another job But at any rate I had this this freedom and um the girl had come into my life to to go and pursue this dream so um I started working at place called D D Studios which was known for doing um a lot of hip hop music kind of stuff similar to what I was interested in and I was hoping I d be able to make some some connections at least maybe do a little bit of networking there and uh I met some pretty cool people did some really kind of really interesting projects um but What kinds of people Well let s see people that I ve met A a DJ by the name of Funk Master Flex who put out a few albums and I don t even remember what they called The Mix Mix Tape Volume one and two and three to whatever it is now and a guy by the name of D J Premier who worked with um Gangstar a group called Gangstar and uh another guy named Jerry O Danagar who also worked with a guy named Jay Z who s pretty popular right now um a guy from out west named Exhibit and uh basically a very a kind of a close knit group of people that did this professionally that that really mostly came from Brooklyn and a few other areas of New York City Anyway the studio itself was kind a dingy it wasn t very professional It was really dirty and had a reputation as being such um kind of a grungy atmosphere environment but where you could do what you wanted to do and get stuff done and what have you From there that was kind of frustrating me a little bit going into um sessions every day or every night and having 15 people around me smoking fat blunts drinking forties of Old English and really not getting a whole lot of stuff done that was it was it was just depressing And uh seeing people with no real creative potential getting paid to do music wasn t very encouraging or inspiring to me So I needed to get out of that environment Um so I began looking around for other studios that I thought might uh have a higher level of professionalism From there I went to a place called Battery Studios which had everything that that I was looking for It was uh a very established studio and had put out a lot of um I guess well known artists and it was actually it was affiliated with Jive Records um and Jive Records I guess at the time had their big act was the Backstreet Boys and they were recording the Backstreet Boys first American released album So I got to work on that a little bit um and I actually met the whole the whole other caliber of artists But then also a lot of the same that uh that deal with the D D and it was a much cleaner environment They they definitely had a lot of pride in in the appearance of the studio and how well it was maintained which was nice It was nice to at least be working for people who seemed to care about where they were and how things were handled And I met some interesting people there and um D Angelo was probably one of the most interesting people that I met there and just just one of the most down to earth artists that I I have met in the industry Um also a pothead but not really so consumed with it necessarily Sort of it was just kind of how he worked He did things very slowly and I don t think that wasn t necessarily the weed that he smoked I think he just had a style of working and that was how he did it I also worked with The Roots while I was there and their sessions were just hectic You didn t like them I liked them but yeah no I like them but they I think which CD does shehave Um Things Fall Apart I don t know Black cover Black cover Black cover with white black and white Black and white yeah I think I have credit on that CD actually You do Yeah on some of the songs yeah If if it s Things Fall Apart yeah my name is in the album binding as an assistant engineering credit on the creative cut track So what did you actually do I helped people put their music and their vocals to tape Basically um the engineer is pretty much the one that that mans the the mixing board and adjusts all the volume levels and equalizes the the different instruments and sounds and separates things and adds effects to it echoes and So do they actually change the tone of people s voice They can change the tone of people s voice yes Do they do it a lot They don t do it a lot but with with artists um that really can t sing very well that are very big artists that they need to have a perfect sound on the recording they do There was one particular woman I don t recall her name I think her first name was Patricia and I don t really recall her last name but she was a French artist They were comparing her to the French Mariah Carey is actually what they described her as and I I never heard of her before being there and haven t really heard anything of her since but I remember they were doing an album of hers and everyday after they would do it they would give a digital tape to a different engineer who would then take it in the back room and correct her voice Basically if she couldn t hit a note he would digitize it so that she did Um And they did that a lot with her specifically Don t they do that a lot with like Britney Spears and people like that Well with Brittney Spears I think what they probably do is they um they ve got a lot of back up singers that can sing and they kind of blend her voice into theirs when she can t quite do it And another another technique that they kind a use is chorusing where they will allow you to basically record your vocal the same the same verse or the same whatever the same words the same lyrics on a few different tracks and they ll kind a blend it all together so that it it almost sounds like one very full voice They also have a lot of uh effects processors that they can run it through that will add harmonics that will kind of smooth out the voice You know echoes and stuff like that It just kind a fills it out a little bit makes it a little easier on the ear especially if they can t sing but Well Battery Studios was great but it was just uh it was just hectic because once if if they actually liked you and they liked how you worked there and you got along well with the artists and the engineers and stuff like that they would work you to death I had had put in several weeks that were between 60 and 90 hours a week Tiring Yeah I mean it was kind a it was rough especially on a young marriage when when you go into work at six p m you know basically crossing paths on the way out as as Kim was coming in and get to work stay at work until five a m come home as Kim was getting up and getting ready for work go to sleep she goes to work I wake up eat shower and all that good stuff and then uh she s coming home and I m going out again After doing that for a couple of weeks it s kind of like Damn you know We didn t get to spend any time with each other and just being married and you know within a year or so or a year or two it was um Kim being unfamiliar with with New York City and not really liking it very much It was kind of it s sort of it seemed unfair to me to um to subject her to that and plus I mean the schedule was just starting to take a toll on me as well and you can only put in so many 80 hour weeks before you kind of break down from it Uh huh Plus I really wasn t making the kind of connections that I wanted to make Unfortunately um at least like with managers and producers and and other I guess industry executives or industry people and other people that really could make decisions about things when they re in the studio working with somebody else that s what they focus on Plus being there and watching how they dealt with other people you kind of pick on people s shadiness and and bullshit so that they just I mean you kind of see people for what they are when they don t have their guard up as much and under those kind a those conditions they really don t have their guard up that much they re just kind a relaxing and being themselves and it s kind of scary to see what some people are when they re being themselves Uh huh But uh I guess I did that for it must have been close to um a year and a half maybe and then I decided not and ended up leaving I think uh Fourth of July was my last day there in 1998 maybe 99 but it was fun while it lasted you know it was a lot of cool experiences got to meet a lot of interesting people um got exposed to what I thought I might want to do it and decided that I didn t really want to do it so I guess uh it was a learning experience and one I don t have any regrets about it but it was a lot of fun and You can stop Yeah Uh huh OK good Thank you
