 March 15 2000 Dear Habitat Partner As you know just a few short weeks from now families everywhere will be celebrating Mother s Day honoring mothers in ways that have become so familiar to all of us over the years There ll be greeting cards filled with loving sentiments and brightly wrapped gifts too There ll also be long distance phone calls from the children Or maybe even dinner for Mom at a local restaurant And for those whose mothers are now deceased there ll be moments of remembrance and prayer expressing gratitude to God for a lifetime s worth of love and protection as a newfound appreciation of the Mother s Day gestures that come from their own children Just about everyone I know has experienced these kinds of things over the years to mark this day But today I am asking you to be even more aware of Mother s Day this year and what it means to women and children in need Because I doubt that you have ever encountered a mother like the Pensacola Florida woman I want to tell you about Nor have you experienced a Mother s Day ending that is so glorious as this one And when I m finished telling you her incredible story I m hoping you will see your way clear to send Habitat for Humanity a generous tax deductible contribution to help make the same kind of joyous ending possible for so many other mothers and their families who have the same urgent need for a simple decent house and the sense of hope that goes along with it Before I tell you more about that remarkable woman in Pensacola however a woman named Wanda Rudolph whose love compassion and sense of generosity ought to be an example to everyone I want to tell you just a little bit about what every mother trying to go it alone with her children on a marginal or worse income is facing Put plainly there is no way to overstate the alarm everyone in America ought to feel over the fact that childhood poverty despite our nation s skyrocketing wealth is still on the increase Nor can I overstate the fear that every low income mother throughout the United States and around the world must carry with her every day that the consequences of poverty will ultimately catch up with her children too Consequences of poverty include inadequate nutrition and its effects such as the real possibility of slow mental development Or the childhood maladies left untreated because there is no money for a doctor Or the terrible cycle of poor self esteem bad study habits unfulfilled potential and a life ultimately lived without hope In the United States we have a rate of childhood poverty that is higher sometimes two or three times higher than other major western industrialized nations More than one fifth of the children in this rich nation live in poverty Indeed while many Americans grew wealthier during the 1980s and 1990s the rate of childhood poverty in America was actually rising by 20 percent This tragic background brings me to the story of Wanda Rudolph of Pensacola Florida who made a courageous decision on behalf of her family a year ago A 26 year old single mother Wanda was already up against the hard economic realities presented by three young children More than five years of working at a local fast food chain had allowed her to keep food on the table and pay the rent for the small two bedroom apartment they shared but not much more Things were certainly not easy but Wanda was determined to give her kids the very best life she could just like her own mother had for her a mother Wanda describes as a wonderful role model We may not have had everything that we wanted or we d seen other people have but she made sure we had the necessary things that we needed And she was always there for us Wanda says of her mother In fact long after Wanda was on her own her mother was still being a role model and still being there for her family For she had taken in the children of Wanda s deeply troubled sister rather than see them separated and shuffled off to foster care There were seven children but they were family and Wanda s mother even though she was getting on in years was determined to keep them together no matter how difficult it would be financially And then a year ago this past December disaster happened in a family that didn t need any more trouble Wanda s mother passed away and Wanda had a decision to make It was a decision made with a mother s heart Rather than giving her sister s children to Social Services to strangers Wanda chose to take on the responsibility of raising them herself knowing full well that the likelihood of her sister coming back into the picture as a fulltime mother was not a strong one at all It was a decision made not only with love but with courage And the situation Wanda then found herself in bore that out Can you imagine trying to raise ten children in a two bedroom apartment Can you imagine what it must be like never mind the financial pressures of just trying to live Can you see the bunkbeds and mattresses on the floor that put seven of the kids as young as two and as old as 12 in the same bedroom Or the mealtimes that have the entire family trying to find a place to sit and balance their plates while eating wherever they can find a place Or the demands placed on one bathroom by a family of eleven Or the virtual impossibility of finding a quiet place to study or even think so that the children can cope in school and one day have a chance of achieving something better Or the seemingly impossible task of trying to keep such a crowded home neat and clean Well if you can imagine these things I know you can imagine that even in the atmosphere of love that Wanda created the children began to have trouble Problems at school and at home began to surface as the children reacted to the pressures of their crowded living situation and their emotions such as pain and anger at having been abandoned by their mother Homework went undone Fights began to occur at home The phone repeatedly began to ring at Wanda s new job with calls from school because another of the children was having problems Worst of all Wanda had to deal with this worsening problem as she was trying to succeed at her new job Her anxiety level rose every time the telephone rang But because of the compassion and generosity shown by Habitat partners like you Wanda s prayers were suddenly answered she was approved for a Habitat house the kind of miracle that people who grow up in Wanda s world never seriously hope for let alone expect And Wanda s miracle isn t just the house which will make it possible for the children to achieve some privacy and basic space from one another That will only be the first step toward healing the pain of having been abandoned several times neglected and denied the happy childhood that should be every child s birthright As Wanda explains They ve been shipped from places from home to home and I think they missed out on things they shouldn t have like having their birthdays celebrated They didn t get to do all that and they should Mom was too old to try to do it so I give them that chance This past year even though it was kind of hard we always made sure they had a birthday party And this year was the first time they ever got to go to the county fair I m trying now with counseling to get them to get along with each other and to let them go out and be with their friends and do the stuff that I did as a child But I m also trying to teach them that they have to earn what they get and to be part of making sure their lives are better That s all I want for them to be better So I can feel like they re going to accomplish something and be fine on their own And the first step toward accomplishing something of course is learning that it s possible growing up experiencing home ownership as a fact of daily life knowing there s a quiet place to study having your friends over to play without being embarrassed about where you live But this new awareness of life s possibilities isn t confined to children by any means The adults feel it too especially the single mothers who have accomplished something of extreme difficulty changing their family s economic prospects on their own in a country that still makes that harder for a woman than for a man while still filling all the roles that go with the blessed title of mother And as I talk to women homeowners all over the country I am always mindful of how very much they see the Habitat experience from exactly this perspective as mothers For each day they see the lives of their children constantly enriched by living in a community of people who helped build their house as others had helped them Is it any wonder they go to bed every night with prayers of thanks for what is now possible for their children And you can be sure that there are also prayers of thanks in their hearts for the people like you who made it possible Wanda is as aware as any mother can be about the new possibilities you create which she calls a wonderful thing to know I told all my friends about Habitat and how it works When I hear them talk about how they ll never own their own home I tell them there s hope for us that I m living proof and everything I ve prayed on every night has been answered You re a part of those answered prayers That s why I hope you will take special delight in knowing that on the day Wanda s new Habitat house is dedicated your loving spirit will be felt on that joyous occasion I hope you ll think of Wanda and other mothers prayers and dreams this Mother s Day And more than that I hope you ll also think about what it will mean for them to have a simple decent home for their kids Your continued generosity can help change a desperate mother s life And in tribute to all of the precious mothers in your own life I hope you will share your love with mothers in need the world over today Bless you In joyous partnership Millard Fuller Founder and President P S May you be blessed today and always as you so generously share your blessings with others For your timely reply you have my deepest thanks
