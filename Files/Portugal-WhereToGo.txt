 WHERE TO GO A lthough a small country Portugal is blessed with incredible geographical diversity Carved out of the western sixth of the Iberian peninsula the country is quite easy to get around Even a relatively short amount of time and distance covered allows visitors to sample varied regions and attractions including famed beaches rugged mountains splendid castles traditional rural villages and gorgeous medieval cities Most visitors still focus on the charming capital Lisbon and the alluring sunny beaches of the Algarve but there s much more to Portugal Lisbon For years Lisbon has enjoyed a reputation as a relatively quiet town without the hustle bustle and general hassle of other major European cities While there are still ample remnants of that easy going charm the gap is quickly closing the city now hardly lacks for traffic and noise Portugal s capital city is the country s largest with a population of more than 2 million Due to a massive earthquake that obliterated much of the ancient city most of the architecture that remains is from the 18th century However old sections of the town survive in the winding alleys of the medieval and Moorish district known as the Alfama The city is covered in greater detail in the Berlitz Pocket Guide to Lisbon The center of Lisbon is small compact and easy to get around in just a few days The city is built on hills by legend seven but in fact many more providing several splendid vantage points Perhaps the best place to start your tour of Lisbon is from the Moors old castle the Castelo de S o Jorge The fall of the castle to crusaders in 1147 proved crucial in the Reconquest of Portugal from the Moors From its ramparts you can take in the whole of the city and the broad Rio Tejo River Tagus spanned by the longest suspension bridge in Europe Alfama Baixa districts Nearby the atmospheric medieval Alfama district is Lisbon s most picturesque and fascinating area It spills down the side of a hill between the Castelo de S o Jorge and the Tagus with all the color and bustle of an Arab bazaar The bairro district in fact a legacy of the Moors is a charming labyrinth of crooked streets cobbled alleyways decaying old houses and palaces fish stalls and fado music clubs The Alfama was one of the few areas to survive the earthquake Another majestic view of the city is from a charming park Miradouro de Santa Luzia just down the hill from the castle Lisbon s S Patriarcal cathedral appears out of nowhere at a bend in the road most easily reached from the center by continuing east on the extension of Rua da Concei o Begun as a fortress church in the 12th century its towers and walls suggest a beleaguered citadel Adjacent to the cathedral is the lovely Igreja de Santo Ant nio da S named for Lisbon s patron saint St Anthony of Padua Just beyond the dense quarters of the Alfama is S o Vicente de Fora St Vincent Beyond the Walls an Italianate church and monastic cloister The latter is the true highlight Its courtyards are lined with blue and white azulejos and the views from the roof are among the best in the city Down toward the river is the Museu Nacional do Azulejo National Azulejo Museum devoted entirely to the art of painted and glazed ceramic tiles a national art form About 12 000 are on display here from 15th century polychrome designs to 20th century art deco styles A prized possession is the Lisbon Panorama a 36 m 118 ft long tile composition of Lisbon s riverside as it looked before the 1755 earthquake Part of the museum which occupies a former convent is the fabulous interior of the small church of Igreja da Madre de Deus a heady mix of gilt Rococo and gorgeous azulejos A district known as the Baixa Lower City the low lying area between hills on either side was devastated by the great earthquake of 1755 The Marqu s de Pombal supervised the city s reconstruction redesigning it according to a geometric grid of broad avenues The Baixa is Lisbon s principal business district Pra a do Com rcio a grand square with a vast triumphal arch is lined on three sides by gracious arcaded buildings The square also called by its former name Terreiro do Pa o wholly wiped out by the great earthquake of 1755 has seen its share of watershed political events King Carlos and his son were felled by an assassin s bullets there in 1908 and it was the site of one of the first uprisings of the Carnation Revolution of 1974 Ferries ply across the Tagus from a point near the square and from another to the west near the Cais do Sodr railway station where trains depart for Estoril and Cascais A wide pedestrian shopping street Rua Augusta leads from the Pra a do Com rcio through a stately arch to the central square of Lisbon Pra a Dom Pedro IV better known as the Rossio the Common Once the scene of bullfights it now hosts a funfair and is a popular meeting point ringed by caf s The National Theater is located here and across the road is the Esta o do Rossio with trains to Sintra and other places which looks something like a Moorish palace with horseshoe arches just west of the square Two blocks north is another lively square Pra a dos Restauradores with its historic obelisk commemorating the overthrow of Spanish Hapsburg rule in 1640 The main tourist office is located here at Pal cio Foz on the west side of the square The broad and leafy Avenida da Liberdade runs for 1 km 0 6 mile north flanked by gardens ponds and fountains as far as the circular Pra a Marqu s de Pombal also known as the Rotunda where a statue of the dictator Pombal gazes over the city North of Parque Eduardo VII off Avenida Ant nio Augusto Auiar is Lisbon s most remarkable museum the Museu Gulbenkian One of the finest private collections in Europe since bequeathed to Portugal it was created as an exhibiton space for the thousands of works of art acquired by the renowned Armenian billionaire Calouste Gulbenkian A little further north you ll find the impressive 18th century Aguas Livres Aqueduct which still carries water along its 18 km 11 mile length to a point near the modern Amoreiras Shopping Center Bairro Alto Bel m Back toward the river and just west of the Pra a do Com rcio is Lapa an elegant residential neighborhood Its standout attraction is the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga National Museum of Ancient Art Portugal s largest museum Among its masterpieces of international renown are The Adoration of St Vincent a multi panel work attributed to the 15th century Portuguese master Nuno Gon alves and The Temptation of St Anthony a fantastic hallucination by Hieronymus Bosch tempered with humor and executed with mad genius The Bairro Alto Upper City is a hilly area full of evocative houses decorated with wrought iron balconies usually occupied by birdcages and flowerpots At night the district is loaded with atmosphere patrons tumble from restaurants theaters bars and fado clubs It s a relatively harmless place by day but you should exercise some care after dark Perched on the edge of the Bairro Alto is one of Lisbon s most evocative sights the shell of the 14th century Igreja do Carmo which was packed with worshippers on All Saints Day 1755 when the terrible earthquake brought the roof down The church remains deliberately preserved as an atmospheric ruin Nearby the sumptuous 16th century Igreja de S o Roque features a lavish baroque chapel of S o Jo o Baptista St John the Baptist and a small museum of sacred art You can easily walk to the Bairro Alto from the central squares in the Baixa but it s also fun to go by tram or board the landmark 30 m 98 ft Elevador de Santa Justa which you ll find just off Rossio square The stately elevator a 1902 Victorian marvel of iron and glass was built by Raul Mesnier not Gustave Eiffel as many continue to believe The longer slower route back downhill meanders through the elegant shopping area of Chiado now totally rebuilt after a drastic 1988 fire that swept through the district Some 6 km 4 miles west of Pra a do Com rcio along the river lies the riverside district of Bel m Many of the great voyages of discovery set out from here in the 15th and 16th centuries The new sea routes produced a golden age of commerce and King Manuel built two magnificent monuments to commemorate the country s achievements One is the small but exquisite Torre de Bel m a romantic medieval fortress particularly when floodlit by night erected in 1515 to defend the entry to Lisbon and one of the finest examples of Manueline architecture see page 25 By contrast the majestic Mosteiro dos Jer nimos is Lisbon s largest religious monument and a truly formidable example of Manueline architecture The imposing church and its double decker cloister miraculously survived the 1755 earthquake In addition to royal tombs the monastery holds the relics of national heroes Vasco da Gama and the poet Luis de Cam es It also houses an archaeology museum and next door is the Museu da Marinha Naval Museum Back down the street toward Lisbon is the highly popular Museu Nacional dos Coches National Coach Museum located in the former riding school of the Bel m Royal Palace One of Bel m s best known symbols is the modern Padr o dos Descobrimentos Monument to the Discoveries The huge waterfront sculpture depicts Prince Henry the Navigator at the prow of a stylized caravel jutting into the Tagus River The figures just behind Prince Henry represent noted explorers map makers and astronomers whom he mobilized in order to launch Portuguese ships into the history books Other attractions in Bel m include the Gulbenkian Institute s Planetarium and the huge Centro Cultural de Bel m home to concerts and art exhibits Eastern Lisbon At the extreme opposite of the city Lisbon s newest attraction is the park designed for the World Expo 98 which did much to reinvigorate the faltering industrial section in the eastern part of the city Continuing to draw visitors to the riverfront Parque das Na es Nations Park is its world class aquarium the Ocean rio de Lisboa perhaps the world s top aquarium The park is out of the way but easily accessible by Metro subway LISBON ENVIRONS Queluz Just 14 km 8 miles west of Lisbon is the Palacio Nacional de Queluz home to the pretty pink palace commissioned by Pedro III The sumptuous summer palace was built in the second half of the 18th century as an official working residence for the royal family The Palace Gardens are the pride of Queluz with clipped hedges in perfect geometric array imaginative fountains and armies of statues Sintra Though Sintra 30 km 18 miles to the northwest of Lisbon suffers the effects of its enduring popularity it is one of the finest towns in Portugal to visit Nestled into the Serra de Sintra 25 km 16 miles northwest of Lisbon it was once a coveted summer retreat for royals and today is a romantic getaway for people from all over the world Clustered throughout the forested hillsides are old palaces and estates with spectacular vistas Located right in the center of town is the spectacular Pal cio Nacional de Sintra also called the Pa o Real or Royal Palace easily recognized by its two huge white conical chimneys Used since the early 14th century as a stately summer home for Portuguese kings its interiors and furnishings are remarkable including one of the oldest and most valuable collections of azulejos to be found in all of Portugal A steep road of hairpin turns leads up into the serra from Sintra to the town s most spectacular monuments The oldest is the Castelo dos Mouros Moors Castle erected during the 8th century soon after the Moors occupied Portugal The dauntless Afonso Henriques conquered it for the Christians in 1147 a major victory in the reconquest of Portugal Those with the energy to do so should climb the ramparts to the top for incredible views of the entire forested area On the hilltop further up the same winding road over 450 m 1 500 ft above sea level is the Pal cio da Pena an outrageous Victorian folly built in 1840 The palace is a bizarre and extravagant cocktail of Gothic Renaissance Manueline and Moorish architecture fashioned as a love nest for Queen Maria II 1834 1853 and her smitten husband Ferdinand of Saxe Coburg Gotha Inside rooms are a riot of imaginative ornate and in some cases suffocatingly sumptuous details A short hop from Sintra are the attractive village of Colares the beach at Praia das Ma s and the rugged coastline at Cabo da Roca the westernmost point of the European mainland Sintra s helpful tourist information office on Pra a da Rep blica in the old quarter can direct you to any of these Estoril Coast The Costa do Estoril formerly called the Costa do Sol begins just west of Lisbon and goes all the way around the tip of the peninsula to Guincho on the open Atlantic Those seeking pollution free swimming see page 132 usually head for Guincho but the famous old resort of Estoril itself some 24 km 15 miles from Lisbon is still worth a visit The beaches and resorts west of Lisbon are all accessible by train from the capital s Cais do Sodr station While Estoril is a full scale resort cosmopolitan and sybaritic Cascais which sits on a pretty curved bay leads a double life as a town of fishermen and kings where the humble and the retiring rich coexist with camera toting tourists The main square is a charmer The Pa os do Concelho Town Hall has stately windows with iron railings separated by panels of azulejos depicting saints A forbidding 17th century fort known as the Cidadela citadel is one of the few buildings to have survived the earthquake and tidal wave of 1755 The municipal park down the road holds the Museu dos Condes de Castro Guimar es a museum with archaeological remains art works old furniture gold and silver The road west 3 km 2 miles from Cascais passes Boca do Inferno Mouth of Hell a geological curiosity where in rough weather the waves send up astonishingly high spouts of spray accompanied by ferocious sound effects At Guincho you have the choice of either a sandy beach or the rocks to fish from but be careful They face the open sea and it s often rough South of the Tagus The Ponte 25 de Abril across the River Tagus became the longest suspension bridge in Europe when it was opened to traffic in 1966 It leads to several destinations south of Lisbon popular with Portuguese and international visitors alike The topographical highlight of the Arr bida peninsula is undoubtedly the Serra da Arr bida site of a nature reserve a mountain chain around 35 km 22 miles long which protects the coast from the strong north winds and accounts for the Mediterranean vegetation The tiny little beach spot Portinho da Arr bida is popular with Portuguese weekenders Set bal the district capital is just a 20 minute drive from Lisbon by motorway longer if you take the picturesque route via Sesimbra and Arr bida This is olive and citrus country with cows grazing among the trees Set bal is a conglomeration of market town industrial center resort and Portugal s third largest fishing port Set bal s greatest historical and artistic treasure the Gothic Igreja de Jesus was built around 1490 by the great French architect Boytac who later built Lisbon s glorious Jer nimos Monastery see page 36 A dramatic main portal leads into the church which boasts two inspired elements of decoration 17th century azulejos on the walls and stone pillars like twisted strands of clay fragile looking in spite of their obviously solid dimensions North of Lisbon In modest Portugal the dimensions and extravagance of the convent and palace of Mafra 40 km 25 miles to the northwest of Lisbon are quite staggering The riches are attributable to King Jo o V who in 1711 conceived this project to celebrate the long awaited birth of his first child Princess D Maria after three years of marriage The convent took 13 years to build and employed more than 50 000 people at one time Its huge cost gave rise to a Portuguese saying that Jo o transformed the diamonds of Brazil into the rocks of Mafra The convent library is the undisputed highlight it has a vaulted ceiling a precious wood floor and tall shelves housing 30 000 books making it the largest one room library in Portugal Visits to the Mafra Palace are by guided tour only English speaking at 11am and 2 30pm daily closed Tuesday and last about an hour Another 10 km 6 miles to the coast is the fishing village and growing resort of Ericeira a natural port The old section is a winsome town of cobbled streets winding between white washed cottages everything clean neat and treasured by both inhabitants and visitors alike Estremadura and Ribatejo The historic regions north of Lisbon Estremadura between the Tagus river and the Atlantic coast and Ribatejo extending into the agricultural central plains possess some of Portugal s most important monuments and most interesting and attractive towns bidos the Coast Almost too perfect to be true the high medieval walls of bidos completely encircle a jewel of a town Equally hard to believe this inland town was once a port and coastal fortress until the sea inlet here silted up leaving the quiet bidos lagoon cut off and the shoreline nearly 10 km 6 miles away Traditionally the town was given as a wedding gift from the King of Portugal to his bride An entrance at the north end is guarded by the 13th century castle which has been adapted as one of the more luxurious and perennially full pousadas see page 174 The narrow streets inside the town s walls are enchanting all lined with white washed houses decorated with colorful flowers It s a safe bet that bidos has never looked so neat and clean in all its history so it s inevitably jammed with curious visitors at times At street level Rua Direita the main drag runs from one gate to the other Just down from the castle the parish church Igreja de Santa Maria has handsome blue 18th century azulejos an odd blue painted ceiling and the gilded tomb in the north wall Afonso V married his cousin Isabel in this small church in 1441 when they were mere children he was 10 she all of eight Due west on the coast the old port of Peniche was once an island The port s imposing fortifications were built by Spain during its period of rule in the 16th century The fishing harbor is usually jammed with colorful storm battered craft and flanked by excellent informal fresh fish restaurants The fort nearby held political prisoners during the Salazar r gime now it s a museum as well as a display area for local crafts and traditions In fine weather you might wish to take a trip to the island of Berlenga 12 km 7 miles offshore With monastery ruins and an impressive 17th century fort that still stands it s now a sanctuary for seabirds Alcoba a and Batalha Abbeys Two admirable abbeys and two of Portugal s most moving monuments are found inland north of bidos The first is the former Cistercian monastery Mosteiro de Santa Maria de Alcoba a Built to celebrate a victory the 1147 battle in which Dom Afonso Henriques took over the town of Santar m from the Moors the church remains the largest in Portugal In the transept about 30 m 100 ft apart are the tombs of Pedro I and In s de Castro their effigies facing each other and surrounded by attendant angels Pedro and In s lived a tragic love story that ended with her murder ordered by Pedro s father King Afonso IV The lovers tombs are decorated with Portugal s greatest medieval stonecarving The monastery s so called Cloister of Silence ordered by King Dom Dinis in the early 14th century is a model of harmony and simplicity Farther north 16 km 9 miles is the even more impressive many turreted and buttressed Mosteiro da Batalha Battle Monastery King Jo o I ordered the construction of this Gothic masterpiece in gratitude for the victory over Juan I of Castile at the Battle of Aljubarrota nearby in 1385 see page 17 In the center of the Capela do Fundador Founder s Chapel a tomb contains the remains of Jo o and his queen Philippa of Lancaster their effigies lie side by side hand in hand Family members are nearby niches in the walls hold the tombs of their children most notably that containing Prince Henry the Navigator Portugal s Unknown Soldiers are buried in the monastery s Chapterhouse This vaulted chamber 20 sq m 65 sq ft was a great engineering wonder in its day around 1400 Due to fears that the unsupported ceiling would collapse at any time the architect is said to have employed only convicts under sentence of death to work on the project Be sure not to miss the unfinished chapels open to the sky at the east end of the church but visited from the outside The quintessential fishing village Nazar the Portuguese Nazareth is now a thriving commercial resort However some fishermen here continue to wear the colorful local dress black stocking caps and plaid trousers and the women still appear in black shawls bright aprons and seven petticoats one for each day of the week S tio the 90 m 300 ft cliff at the north end of Nazar offers an excellent vantage point over the green hilly countryside the tiled roofs of the neatly packed town and mile after mile of beach open to the full force of the Atlantic Ocean F tima Set in bleak hill country about 135 km 84 miles north of Lisbon F tima once just a poor village is one of the most important centers of pilgrimage in the Catholic world along with Lourdes in France and Santiago de Compostela in Spain On 13 May 1917 three young shepherds claimed they saw a series of miraculous visions of the Virgin Mary said to disclose three secrets or prophecies to the children followed by a solar phenomenon witnessed by thousands in October of the same year Two of the children died of pneumonia soon after these inexplicable events the third Lucia now in her 90s has been a cloistered Carmelite nun in Coimbra since 1929 and makes very few public appearances The 20th century neo Baroque basilica that draws so many of the faithful said to be twice as big as St Peter s in Rome faces an immense but rather plain square Pilgrimages are held on the 13th of every month with the most important observances on that date in May and October Yet even on an ordinary weekday scattered believers some kneeling in penitence come to F tima to pay homage to the Virgin Mary Tomar Sitting astride the River Nab o Tomar 34 km 21 miles east of F tima is one of Portugal s most fascinating towns Tomar s pleasant central square Pra a da Republica is flanked by the elegant Manueline church of S o Jo o Baptista with an unusual octagonal belfry and intricate portico and the 17th century town hall The statue in the center of the plaza tells the real story of the town though Beneath a colony of ever present pigeons it depicts Gualdim Pais Grand Master of the Portuguese branch of the crusading Order of the Knights Templar to whom the town was granted in 1157 Unusual for a town so dominated by Christian crusaders a small 15th century sinagoga synagogue survives on Rua Dr Joaquim Jacinto just off the main square The room has a high vaulted ceiling along with eight clay pots embedded in the walls to improve the acoustics classical concerts are now occasionally held here A museum displays old Jewish tombstones In 1992 Yom Kippur was celebrated here for the first time in 500 years The standout sights however are up on the hill above town The Templars old stronghold the UNESCO World Heritage sites Castelo dos Templ rios Templars Castle and the accompanying Convento do Cristo Convent of Christ overlook Tomar from wooded heights Behind crenellated walls the outstanding 12th century Convento do Cristo is one of the highlights of central Portugal At the heart of the complex is the original Templar church the fascinating 12th century Charola a 16 sided structure based on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre built over Christ s tomb in Jerusalem Knights once attended services here on horseback In its interior is a gilded octagonal structure which appears almost more pagan than Christian looking Recently completed restoration has revived the Charola s esoteric paintings The two storied nave added by Manuel I is divided into an upstairs choir and a chapterhouse underneath One of the finest Manueline windows in Portugal is carved in the western wall of the Chapterhouse encrusted with profusely carved marine motifs The grand Renaissance style Claustro Principal Great Cloister was added in the 16th century Halfway up the wooded road to the Convento de Cristo is the 16th century Ermida da Nossa Senhora da Concei o a handsome little basilica in classic Italian Renaissance style From Tomar an enjoyable excursion is to the fairytale castle at Almourol marooned on an island in the Tagus Just upriver is Abrantes with its own castle overlooking the town Santar m 78 km 48 miles northeast of Lisbon is the ancient capital of the agricultural region of the Ribatejo whose lifeblood is the mighty River Tagus Few of Santar m s monuments have survived although the Jesuit seminary and church on the main square the triangular Largo S da Bandeira has an impressive 17th century baroque fa ade North of the city center is the 15th century Igreja de Gra a with its magnificent Gothic rose window amazingly carved from a single piece of stone In the south of the city is the Marvila church built in Manueline style with fine 17th century azulejos Across the street is an interesting archaeological museum in a Romanesque church A fine panoramic view can be had from the Portas do Sol miradouro belvedere a garden surrounded by Moorish walls overlooking the River Tagus and the extensive plains of the Ribatejo A Phoenician dye house was recently discovered on the grounds In this agricultural land bulls and horses can be seen grazing all over the Ribatejo Vila Franca de Xira 45 km 28 miles down the Tagus in the direction of Lisbon is a modest town but the center of Portuguese bullfighting Every July and October a festival with Pamplona style bull running through the streets called a largada accompanies the bullfights The tranquil town of Goleg explodes once a year when the important Feira Nacional do Cavalo National Horse Fair is held in November If you can t be here when all the horses and breeders are at least have

Tagus Estuary Natural Reserve an important wetlands whose headquarters are in Alcochete The Beiras The three ancient provinces known as the Beiras together make up the broad swathe of land lying between the Tagus and Douro rivers Beiras means edge revealing the boundary position these provinces have long occupied between northern and southern Portugal Each of the three provinces retains its own distinctive character The lovely university city of Coimbra dominates the Beira Litoral Coastal Beira The neighboring coastline forms part of the Costa de Prata Silver Coast and has largely escaped development though it does have resorts at Figueira da Foz and Aveiro Inland is the spectacular terrain of the Beira Alta Upper Beira Small granite hills begin to develop into great mountains dressed in pine trees The population is small and the number of tourists few despite the strange beauty of the landscape with its giant boulders and flowery meadows The Serra da Estr la is the backbone of the area and offers a host of wonderful valleys and waterfalls for hikers fortified by the area s fabulous cheese Further south the mountains give way to the agricultural plains of the Beira Baixa Lower Beira which lacks the monuments and mountains of its neighbors but still maintains an unspoiled way of life Coimbra and Around The magnificent university city of Coimbra the country s capital during the 12th and 13th centuries has been the pillar of Portuguese intellectual life since 1290 Today it is a lively and prosperous city swimming with students The famous Universidade de Coimbra is the country s oldest The university sits on top of a hill in the old town high above the River Mondego Wending their way up to the University are several small streets that hide rep blicas halls of residence similar to fraternities and sororities and numerous small bars that reverberate to the strains of Coimbra s own distinctive version of fado see page 128 The principal courtyard of the University is marked by a belltower and surrounded by historic buildings on three sides At one end is the spectacular baroque Biblioteca Joanina library constructed in 1720 with Jo o V s Brazilian wealth also instrumental in building the great library at Mafra see page 42 Three exquisitely gilded and painted chambers house some 300 000 leather bound texts in many languages On the same side of the courtyard are the Museu de Arte Sacra Museum of Sacred Art recently closed for restoration and Capela de S o Miguel St Michael s Chapel with fine azulejos and a massive baroque organ Directly ahead is the highly ornate ceremonial hall the Sala dos Capelos the heart of university life it s where degrees are given out The nearby Museu Nacional de Machado de Castro housed in the former archbishop s palace exhibits an excellent collection of medieval sculpture and religious paintings Among the museum s complex of historic buildings are a Moorish tower and Roman crypt in a fascinating warren of underground passages On either side of the museum are Coimbra s two cathedrals the classical baroque S Nova New Cathedral and the vastly more interesting S Velha Old Cathedral The fine Romanesque bulk of the old cathedral is reminiscent of the early crusading cathedrals of Lisbon and Porto Renaissance detail has been added around the portals but the interior remains fairly stark A chapel to the right contains a collection of impressive life size stone carvings of Jesus Mary and the Twelve Disciples Be sure not to miss the peaceful Romanesque cloister The single nave Igreja de Santa Cruz built in 1131 is renowned for its dazzling Manueline detail including an elaborate portico and carved pulpit The church holds the tombs of Portugal s first and second kings Afonso Henriques and Sancho I and the Claustro del Silencio Cloister of Silence is lined with pretty arches and colorful azulejos Down towards the river the Jardim Bot nico with plants collected from across Portugal s

Condeixa a Nova Though the extensive site is still being excavated remnants of fountains thermal pools a sophisticated heating system a large villa and spectacular colorful mosaics some of the finest under roofing at the Casa das Fontes have been unearthed Conimbriga had become a significant Roman town by 25 bc though many of the greatest finds here date to the 2nd and 3rd centuries ad A large museum displays some of the valuable finds from the area Along the Mondego 28 km 17 miles west of Coimbra is the sturdy and imposing 14th century castle at Montemor o Velho the home town of the wanderer Fern o Mendes Pinto affording superb views Here too is the fine Manueline church of Santa Maria de Alc ova founded in 1090 One of Portugal s most ancient forests land that inspires an almost mystical reverence for its citizens is 25 km 15 miles north of Coimbra at Bu aco The forest is home to more than 700 types of trees and was once the preserve of Benedictine monks women were not allowed to enter Footpaths meander all over the thick tranquil forest ideal for long walks Tucked within the forest is the celebrated fantastically ornate Hotel Palace do Bu aco see page 175 formerly a royal summer retreat and a curious stone monastery the Mosteiro dos Carmelitas For further relaxation the nearby town of Luso is full of elegant 19th century buildings casino and thermal spas The

Characterized by its wooden stilt houses it lacks the lively nightlife or accommodations of Figueira camping is available though it does have unspoiled and uncrowded beaches and dunes The main resort along this stretch of coast is historic Aveiro 52 km 32 miles to the south of Porto and 29 km 18 miles north of Mira Aveiro s unique way of life has developed around its lagoon Ria The town was an important port until 1575 when a sandbar formed across the River Vouga cutting the port off from the sea and creating a vast lagoon A canal was cut in 1808 and the ria was traversed by Dutch style canals and bridges The Municipal Museum in the old Convento de Jesus displays religious art including the massive 18th century Chapel of Princesa Santa Joana The tourist office on Rua Jo o Mendon a can arrange boat trips to explore extensive salt pans and see the rich variety of birdlife Beira Alta On the way from Coimbra towards Viseu 87 km 54 miles northeast the land becomes emphatically rural Small terraced farms accompanied by stone houses donkeys and grape vines sit among forested hills This is the D o wine region whose oaky red wines are named after the River D o a tributary of the Mondego Viseu is a dignified and historic town supposedly home to Viriathus the Lusitanian hero who organized the opposition to the Roman invasion of 147 bc The scenic old town is centered around the Pra a da S with its central pillory and wealth of historic buildings The bulky twin towered cathedral originally Romanesque was redesigned in the 17th century The classical cloister has Ionic columns on the first level and Doric on the second The other church on the square the bright white Igreja Miseric rdia features a terrific baroque fa ade but an unprepossessing interior The top sight in Viseu and one of Portugal s most important art museums is the Museu de Gr o Vasco which inhabits the former archbishop s palace next to the cathedral Vasco Fernandes more commonly referred to as Gr o Vasco the Great founded the city s school of painting in the 16th century Huge bold panels of his work are on view including S o Pedro Pentecost and Assun o da Virgem as are those of the various Flemish artists who influenced the Viseu School and those of Vasco s great Portuguese rival Gaspar Vaz Perhaps the most interesting exhibit is the 14 panel depiction of the life of Christ painted by the school of Gr o Vasco in 1501 1506 and transferred from the altar of the Viseu cathedral in the 18th century The Planalto Towards the northeast of the Beira Alta is the barren plateau of the Planalto High Plain a wild cold and sparsely populated region but important enough to have been fought over by Portugal and Spain The plateau s isolation attracted many Jews fleeing the Inquisition The atmospheric walled town of Trancoso 43 km 26 miles to the north of Guarda records this heritage in the stone carvings above the doorways of Jewish houses From miles around you can see the powerful castle walls and strong keep built by Dom Dinis to fortify the border against Spain Almeida 65 km 40 miles east also boasts well preserved fortifications a legacy of its position virtually on the Spanish border The town is enclosed within star shaped fortifications reminiscent of those at Elvas in the Alentejo Serra da Estr la The Serra da Estr la just southwest of Guarda offers Portugal s highest mountains at 1 991 m 6 532 ft and some fantastic scenery for hiking through the Parque Natural Natural Park Seia makes a good base to explore the serra as does Penhas da Sa de the site of

like a real town Linhares boasts a stretch of Roman road and a scenic medieval castle with splendid views of granite peaks and the Rio Mondego valley Details of hiking routes are available at the tourist office in Guarda or Covilh or at the park information offices in Gouveia Manteigas or Seia Some 20 km 12 miles from Guarda is tiny Belmonte with a carefully restored 13th century castle and Jewish Quarter home to this day to a Jewish community Covilh a further 20 km 12 miles south has become a base for exploring the Serra because of its location close to the highest peaks and the ski fields This mountainous area produced several explorers who would help form the Portuguese empire From Covilh came P ro de Covilh who explored India and Ethiopia in the late 15th century and born in Belmonte was Pedro lvares Cabral who discovered Brazil in 1500 Beira Baixa Throughout the Lower Beira agricultural plains and orchards stretch out between rocky hills and sites of ancient settlements The main city in the region is Castelo Branco invaded by the Spanish so often that little of historical interest survives It is still a pleasant city with small cobbled alleyways leading up to the ruined White Castle at the highest point of the town The Pa o Episcopal Bishop s Palace is home to a regional museum displaying a splendid collection of highly elaborate colchas bedspreads as well as 16th century tapestries The elegant formal Palace Gardens are laid out with an array of baroque statues sculpted hedges fountains and pools The nearby Miradouro de S o Gens affords a good view of the city The atmospheric and intensely Portuguese village of Monsanto located about 50 km 31 miles to the northeast of Castelo Branco balances on a dramatic rocky outcrop between massive boulders The streets are too narrow for cars but a short walk to the castle at the top is worth the effort for the impressive stonework and the view A beautiful but roofless 13th century Romanesque church can also be seen A new pousada has just opened here THE NORTH Porto and the Douro Valley Portugal s prosperous second city Porto also written Oporto in English meaning the Port hugs a gorge at the mouth of the Douro river The former Roman settlement of Portus it combined with Calus its twin town on the opposite bank to become known as Portucale in the early Middle Ages Despite its history and economic importance Porto is industrious and less self conscious than Lisbon Even with splendid bridges crossing the Douro and a red roofed jumble of buildings creeping up the hillside its attractions are less obvious than the capital s Still many visitors develop a real attraction to the city Walking is the best way to explore it despite the many hills that spill down to the river The city has a new sense of vitality with a spate of new architecture art galleries and chic shops and restaurants Porto was named European Capital of Culture for 2001 The river that flows all the way to the Spanish border has always been the source of Porto s wealth The Douro snakes past the terraced vineyards of the Douro Valley Those vineyards produce fine table wines and most famously the rich fortified wine known as port which took its name from the city Traditionally port wine was shipped downriver in oak barrels loaded on barcos rabelos flat bottomed square sailed boats to be stored in the cool and damp port lodges merchants warehouses in Vila Nova de Gaia across the river from Porto The wines are still stored there even though they are now transported by truck Porto The city which began down by the river has expanded considerably beyond the old walls Pra a da Liberdade Liberty Square in the upper level now marks the center of the town Not far from here is the main tourist office up Avenida dos Aliados and beside the City Hall at Rua Clube Fenianos 25 For a splendid view over Porto s colorful jumble of streets and crumbling facades head west out of the Pra a down Rua Cl rigos and climb the church belltower of the imposing Baroque Igreja de Cl rigos A couple of blocks east of the tower and south of the Pra a da Liberdade is the airy and ornate Esta o de S o Bento far too handsome to be a mere railway hub Completed in 1916 its lobby is decorated with wonderful azulejo tile panels depicting important scenes from the city s history making it a legitimate tourist attraction Just south of the railway station is the Cathedral District The 12th century Romanesque S Cathedral is bare and austere more fortress than church In the 18th century an attempt was made to improve its plodding appearance with some baroque additions but the church remains rather lifeless Inside the cathedral a beautiful baroque silver altarpiece is worth a look as is the rose window Within these granite walls Jo o I married his English bride Philippa of Lancaster in 1387 the scene is depicted in azulejos in S o Bento railway station thus sealing the ancient alliance between Portugal and England an alliance with particular strength in Porto due to the overwhelming English involvement in the port wine trade Nearby the Casa Museu Guerra Junqueiro Guerra Junqueiro Museum on Rua de Dom Hugo is the 18th century home of the Portuguese poet Guerra Junqueiro The charming museum displays his furniture and collection of art The church of Santa Clara a bit east of the cathedral on Largo 1 de Dezembro remains a bit of a secret and a little difficult to find Renaissance on the exterior and Rococo within its exuberantly carved interior is definitely worth seeking out The riverside quay the Cais da Ribeira is an intriguing and slightly grungy area popular with tourists and diners The old docks hold innumerable seafood restaurants Tour boats tie up here and offer short river tours beneath the city s scenic bridges as well as week long trips up the Douro to R gua see page 67 The impressive Ponte Dom Lu s I a 172 m bridge built in 1886 looms over the colorful houses of the Ribeira and spans the river to the south bank where the port lodges cavas of Vila Nova de Gaia are located see page 59 Just uphill from the river is the Bolsa district named after the elegant 19th century Stock Exchange on the Pra a do Infante Dom Henrique The ornate Neo Classical building no longer functions as a stock exchange but guided tours show visitors around the opulent interior The highlight is the Sal o rabe Arab Room where the Moorish style of the Alhambra in Granada was lavishly recreated Next door is the city s finest church the Igreja de S o Francisco on Rua do Infante D Henrique Conventionally Gothic on the outside the church s interior is like an explosion in a gold factory Gilded rococo details swathe the walls from ground to ceiling The most impressive feature is the Tree of Jesse an elaborately carved gilded and painted 18th century wood sculpture on the northern wall The attention getting piece depicts the family geneaology of Christ Opposite the church is a small but interesting museum with relics of the old monastery and catacombs Also near the Bolsa is the Casa do Infante supposedly the site if not the actual building where Henry the Navigator was born see page 18 This entire block was recently under extensive restoration to become a large city museum Citizens of Porto are very proud of their association with Henry especially since their city was where the fleet for the 1415 assault on Ceuta was fitted out For this patriotic venture against the Moors of North Africa the people of Porto surrendered the finest cuts of meat in their stores to the navy and lived on tripe instead thus earning their honorable nickname of tripeiros literally tripe eaters as people from Porto are commonly known Some of Porto s other interesting museums are northwest of the town center The Museu Soares dos Reis on Rua Dom Manuel II is a wonderful collection of fine art housed in an 18th century Pal cio dos Carrancas Portuguese artists from the 15th to the 20th centuries are well represented including paintings by Josefa de bidos and sculptures by Soares dos Reis Look for his O Desterrado a thoughtful work in marble Also on display are goods that once formed the basis of Portuguese trade with the Orient especially ceramics The Museu Rom ntico Solar do Vinho do Porto Romantic Museum and Port Institute Quinta da Macieirinha Rua Entre Quintas 220 west of Cl rigos displays a collection of 19th century art and furniture in the last home of the deposed King of Sardinia Downstairs is the Solar do Vinho do Porto where you will find hundreds of port vintages waiting to be sampled Further removed but well worth seeking out if you have an interest in modern art and architecture the Funda o Serralves Rua D Jo o de Castro 210 about 3 km 2 miles west of Torre de Cl rigos has two primary parts One is a stark modern shell built by the famed local architect lvaro Siza Vieira and the other a fabulous pink 1930s Art Deco building surrounded by lovely gardens and a park populated with goats Both exhibition spaces house temporary shows by Portuguese and international contemporary artists Vila Nova de Gaia The lower level of the Dom Lu s I Bridge leads to the wine cellars of Vila Nova de Gaia which are the low buildings on the southern bank The familiar and less familiar company names such as Taylor Osborne and Ramos Pinto appear painted in white and neon signs on the roofs From the upper level of the bridge is a wonderful view of the cities on both banks Although it is no longer required by law most port is still blended stored and aged in the port wine lodges of Gaia as the riverfront town is commonly called Almost all were founded after the Treaty of Methuen in 1703 under which the English agreed to reduce the tariffs on port wine imports Most winemaker companies offer free tours of their lodges explaining the production process types of port and the effects of river floods and offer visitors a free sample Whether you tour one of the large scale international port producers such as Sandeman or the smaller more intimate lodges of Portuguese family owned firms such as Cal m or Fonseca a visit is a good introduction to the wonders of port Coastal Excursions Near Porto Porto s nearest beaches lie to the west where the Douro passes a large sandbar and meets the sea at Foz do Douro Mouth of the Douro In the 19th century Foz was a very popular resort but the water is now heavily polluted Nevertheless the beaches and restaurants still make an enjoyable day out and a scenic old tram number 18 provides excursions from the resort to the 17th century Castelo do Queijo Cheese Castle Further north the beach resorts of the Minho s Costa Verde are at least clean even if none too warm The nearest one to Porto is the twin resort area of Vila do Conde P voa de Varzim 27 km 16 miles to the north Vila do Conde is the decidedly more pleasant and less developed of the two P voa do Varzim is a short walk north from Vila do Conde but is a much livelier and more built up resort with a casino An interesting diversion inland from here is to Rates where you can add a dash of culture to the days spent on the beach by looking around the beautiful 11th century Romanesque church The Douro Valley The Douro Valley extending along the river east toward the Spanish border is one of the most attractive regions in Portugal sprinkled with small villages impressive quintas agricultural estates and beautifully terraced vineyards that dramatically hug the river as it courses through the valley Cruises run from the Ribeira waterfront in Porto up to R gua and Pinh o some lasting a day and others an entire week Others run between Pinh o all the way to Pocinho near the border with Spain Alternatively you can travel up or down the length of the Douro Valley by train a spectacular ride or meander through the region by car For additional information contact the tourist office in Porto Upriver from the sandbank at its mouth the Douro runs between Porto and the port lodges of Vila Nova de Gaia passing beneath a series of impressive bridges and on towards port wine territory The railway line from Porto skips the first 60 km 37 miles of the river but this is the least interesting stretch The line eventually joins the river near Ribadouro proceeding along the northern bank past small towns and fields where the haystacks set on cross shaped supports look from a distance like scarecrows Attractive Amarante sits on a gorge of the T mega a tributary of the Douro and makes a good stop if you are driving along the road from Porto towards Mes Frio and R gua Baronial mansions with gaily painted balconies overlooking the river line the streets Rising above a handsome stone arched bridge and leafy park the church of the former 16th century monastery of S o Gon alo is well worth a visit especially if you are looking for love It hosts a pilgrimage in June for women seeking husbands with the exchange of phallic shaped cakes a remarkably literal step in the mating dance The river bends and twists widens and narrows among green terraced hills The port trade prompted the growth of Peso da R gua usually called just R gua 70 km 43 miles east of Porto R gua was once the main port used to ship young wines downriver in barcos rabelos flat bottomed wooden boats to Vila Nova de Gaia Though the railways took over for transport from Pinh o at the confluence of the Douro and Pinh o rivers and today the wine goes mostly by road R gua remains an important transportation and commercial hub What the town lacks in beauty it makes up for in industry The headquarters of port winemakers Casa do Douro remains in R gua visitors can pick up a map of the Port Wine Route there Sandeman operates a large modern winery just across the river and Cockburns is up the hill overlooking R gua Mes o Frio 12 km 7 miles west of R gua is the gateway to the Douro Sitting high above the river amidst the rambling hills of the Serra do Mar o it is an excellent place to relax There are a number of beautiful solares manor houses some of which offer accommodations The prettiest town in the area is the affluent center of Lamego south of the Douro 13 km 8 miles from R gua Although technically part of the Beiras region Lamego s soul belongs to the Douro As well as growing grapes for port Lamego also produces a fine champagne like wine called Raposeira Lamego was once a pilgrimage center a heritage reflected in one of Portugal s most famous churches Baroque Nossa Senhora dos Rem dios and the stunning stone staircase that climbs the hill Inspired by another shrine Bom Jesus see page 76 near Braga the monumental staircase is lined with statues azulejos fountains and chapels Some penitents still heroically climb the 600 plus steps on their knees especially during the great annual pilgrimage on 8 September Lamego has a wealth of handsome Baroque mansions as well as a scenic 13th century castle and a 16th century S cathedral with a 12th century tower The Museu de Lamego in the old bishop s palace houses a fine collection of Flemish tapestries and religious statues as well as paintings by Gr o Vasco of the Viseu school see page 56 Pinh o upriver from R gua both the train trip and drive along the river in this stretch are stunning is an enjoyable little town with deep connections to the port wine trade The tiny train station displays azulejos depicting the harvest and many important quintas owned by the biggest port concerns as well as independently owned vineyards hug the hills near here Taylor one of the major wine players recently opened an excellent hotel in Pinh o the appropriately named Vintage House From Pinh o to Pocinho the train snakes along the Douro s switchbacks with stunning views at every turn 2 hours roundtrip Another good route is north to Tua If you want to get closer to the wine production you ll need to have a car or arrange a tour with one of the quintas or local hotels Other towns ensconced in the craggy green hills and pretty terraced vineyards are Alij S o Jo o da Pesqueira and Sabrosa Having little to do with wine but plenty to do with the historic underpinnings of this region are the archaeological park and sublime Paleolithic rock drawings near Vila Nova de Foz C a 8 km 5 miles south of Pocinho Discovered only in 1992 the engravings of deer goats and horses constitute the largest outdoor assembly of Paleolithic rock art in Europe Visits are by guided tour only through the headquarters of the foundation overseeing the project Attendance is strictly

The lush northwestern province of the Minho north of Porto is one of the most beautiful regions of Portugal The intensely green area is renowned for its mountains and forests vinho verde green wine and Costa Verde Green Coast Portugal originated in this corner just below Galicia the one time Celtic settlement in Spain It was recaptured from the Moors early in the Christian Reconquest campaign and when Afonso Henriques declared himself the first king in 1139 the Minho became the independent state of Portucale covering an area from the Douro to the River Minho Numerous splendid monuments survive in two beautiful historic cities Guimar es and Braga The region is reputed to be one of the most religious and conservative in Portugal Guimar es A large sign in the center of Guimar es 49 km 30 miles northeast of Porto declares Aqui Nasceu Portugal Here was born Portugal testament to the historic nature of this medieval gem of a small city The city s compact yet sturdy 10th century castle seems to have grown out of the rocky hillock Seven towers protect a large central keep lined with unusual triangular battlements that look like serrated teeth Afonso Henriques the first King of Portugal is said to have been born in the castle and baptized nearby in the small Romanesque Igreja de S o Miguel do Castelo Just down the hill is the massive Pa o dos Duques de Bragan a Ducal Palace a mix between a French ch teau and a crusader castle Once the home of the Dukes of Bragan a it fell into disrepair and was reconstructed from ruin in the 1930s Though the reconstruction is not historically accurate a 45 minute tour of the interior is interesting for the large collection of antiques The historic city center runs down the hill from the castle along the Rua de Santa Maria to a series of beautiful medieval squares surrounded by old townhouses The triangular Largo de Santiago is flanked by the arcaded 14th century Old Town Hall and a series of townhouses converted into the Pousada da Oliveira inn Through the arcades is the central Largo da Oliveira where the excellent Museu Alberto Sampaio is located in Nossa Senhora da Oliveira the Collegiate Church of Our Lady of the Olive Tree The museum houses stone carvings from the convent in a 13th century cloister as well as gold ceramics and religious items There is also a room devoted to the battle of Aljubarrota see page 17 exhibits include the shirt worn by Jo o I during the fray The other notable museum in Guimar es is the Museu de Martins Sarmento named for the 19th century excavator of the Cit nia de Briteiros an ancient settlement of Celto Iberians Artifacts displayed recovered from Briteiros and other sites include carved stone lintels tools and several fascinating sculptures such as the enormous pre Roman Colossus of Pedralva In the Penha Hills above the city is the lovely Mosteiro de Santa Marinha da Costa founded in the 12th century This lovely former monastery has been remarkably restored to form one of Portugal s most evocative pousadas The views of Guimar es down the hill are outstanding The most enjoyable way up to Penha which is 5 km 3 miles by road is to take the fast telef rico cable car Catch it at the end of Rua de Doutor Jos Sampaio Near Guimar es Just 15 km 9 miles from Guimar es on the way to Braga is the prehistoric site of Briteiros set on a rocky hillside overlooking a series of valleys and forested hills Inhabited by Celt Iberians from around the 4th century bc to the 4th century ad the entire hillside is covered with the remains of the best preserved cit nia Celtic hill settlement in Portugal The walls of more than a hundred circular houses are visible two have been rebuilt to give an idea of what the settlement once looked like in addition to roads drainage channels and a defensive wall A hike downhill leads to a mysterious structure that has been interpreted both as a burial chamber and as a bath house it now appears to be the latter The most impressive artifacts from the site can be viewed in the Martins Sarmento Museum in Guimar es Braga Gracious and bustling Braga 22 km 13 miles northwest of Guimar es is the 12th century ecclesiastical center of Portugal today famous for its Holy Week celebrations see page 136 It has more than 30 churches to bolster its religious reputation The old town which is peppered with several fine turn of the century caf s on or near Pra a Rep blica including Caf Astoria and A Brasileira is a delight to wander around The original Romanesque exterior of the S Cathedral has been embellished over the years in a number of styles Inside are two extravagant golden organs replete with trumpets a carved choir of Brazil wood and a painted ceiling flanking the nave near the entrance The true wealth of the Archbishopric of Braga though can be glimpsed in the cathedral s stunning but somewhat disheveled Museu de Arte Sacra Museum of Religious Art crammed with gold and silver pieces including the cross that Cabral took on his pioneering voyage to Brazil in 1500 polychromatic figures and azulejos Across a courtyard are a couple of 14th century chapels one with a tomb of the parents of the first King of Portugal and the other a mummified archbishop who died in 1397 The pedestrian only Rua do Souto runs right through the middle of town passing the square of the former Archbishop s Palace nowadays a library and an old medieval keep Before reaching the center at the Pra a da Republica you will find the tourist office housed in a marvelous art deco building Braga is known for its churches but it has many splendid Baroque mansions as well Just west of city center is Palacio dos Biscainhos built in the 17th century the decoration is 18th century The house reflects the refined lifestyle enjoyed by the nobility with azulejo panels showing falconry displays of Chinese porcelain and delightful gardens South of Pra a da Rep blica the magnificently blue tiled Casa do Raio known as the Casa do Mexicano is now a hospital Beyond Braga is one of the north s most frequently photographed sights the 18th century pilgrimage church of Bom Jesus do Monte situated in the mountains 4 km 2 miles east of Braga The twin towered Baroque church is principally notable for the grand staircase that leads up to it It is lined with chapels featuring the 14 Stations of the Cross lichen covered statues urns and fountains The devout climb all the way up on their knees the less committed can walk or take the funicular railway and stay in one of the three hotels located at the top Barcelos West of Braga toward the coast is Barcelos home of the country s largest agricultural fair held every Thursday in the massive open square the Campo da Rep blica Every kind of animal and myriad produce from the Minho is on sale as well as the famous pottery and handicrafts of Barcelos In one corner of the square is the beautiful church of Nossa Senhor Bom Jesus da Cruz an octagonal baroque building The old part of town continues on down to the River C vado The Palace of the Counts of Barcelos overlooks the river but was abandoned after the 1755 earthquake Its shell now houses the various stone artifacts making up the Museu Arqueol gico The Minho Coast The Minho s Costa Verde Green Coast is low key compared with the crowded beaches of the Algarve Beautiful beaches run in a virtually unbroken sweep from Porto all the way up to the Galician Spanish border on the River Minho The region isn t overly touristed though it isn t unusual to see oxen pulling carts piled high with seaweed for fertilizer The only major resort along this coastline is the splendid city of Viana do Castelo 60 km 38 miles north of Porto which is much more than just beaches Viana is bounded by the estuary of the River Lima to the south and by the wooded Monte de Santa Luzia to the north The triangular Pra a da Rep blica forms the center of the historic old town around which are a series of pal cios constructed during Viana s heyday in the 15th century as a bacalhau fishing center Especially interesting are the fine 16th century Renaissance Miseric rdia Almshouse and Gothic Igreja Matriz Rising above Viana is the scenic Monte de Santa Luzia Like Bom Jesus it has a pilgrimage church on the summit and a funicular railway though no grand staircase Though the church itself isn t remarkable the views from the plaza in front take in the north and south coast the River Lima and Viana itself There is also a fine hotel see page 177 and an excavated cit nia pre Roman hillfort faintly reminiscent of Briteiros see page 73 Viana s main beach lies to the south across the estuary at Praia do Cabedelo accessible by ferry or road bridge Heading north along the coast from Viana there is little sand but the rocks are popular for fishing The small quaint resort town of Vila Praia de ncora is 16 km 10 miles further up the coast The River Lima Inland from Viana do Castelo the beautiful flat Lima Valley runs east through a gentle agricultural landscape dotted with haystacks The Romans settled this attractive area and built a bridge at Ponte de Lima 23 km 14 miles upstream from Viana A Roman bridge ponte still spans the Lima though the town is perhaps better known for its ancient bi monthly market The hills on the north side offer scenic walks and Ponte de Lima has an excellent choice of accommodations in old manor houses part of the Turismo de Habita o plan see Accommodations page 147 Ponte de Barca 18 km 11 miles further east along the Lima is also an appealing town Home to a fine 15th century bridge it also hosts a bi monthly market by the river The town serves as a good base for some pleasant hill walks past small unspoiled Minho villages The Peneda Ger s National Park The Lima Valley continues east towards the river s source in Spain passing through the wild and wonderful Peneda Ger s National Park The park is one of the most visited parts of the Minho yet it is very easy to hike up into the mountains and find yourself alone with the mountain goats The park boasts mountains river valleys megalithic monuments antas waterfalls and small mountain hamlets Fifteen species of wild flowers are unique to the park Numerous tracks crisscross the area passing reservoirs that are perfect for a dip after a long day s hike The park is divided into two parts the much visited Serra do Ger s and the quieter wilder Serra da Peneda to the north Caldas do Ger s is the principal tourist base a slightly tattered spa town Hiking advice is available from the park information office and the tourist office can provide details of local accommodations and outdoor activities such as horse trekking The nearby Miradouro do Ger s has a splendid view over much of the park The best approach to the northern Peneda section of the park is from either Mon o or Melga o on the River Minho The main point of access for the eastern part of the park is Caldas do Ger s but there is another fascinating route starting from Chaves see page 83 in Tr s os Montes that crosses a truly remote area passing by the gigantic Pis es dam The River Minho The River Minho forms the northern border between the Minho Portugal and Galicia Spain Its banks are lined by numerous beautiful walled towns and powerful fortresses The charming town of Vila Nova de Cerveira about 20 km 12 miles northeast from the coastal resort of Vila Praia de ncora is typical of them with thick town walls and a regular ferry service across the river to Spain Inside the walls of the old fortress is a luxurious pousada Farther upriver Valen a do Minho boasts dramatic and powerful defensive walls also housing a pousada Within is a well preserved town of winding streets and quaint 17th century buildings Tr s os Montes The name given Tr s os Montes literally Beyond the Mountains suggests how remote and even forgotten it is even in this small country Portugal s poorest region is one of deep river valleys separated by rocky hilltops and dense forests The region retains a sleepy medieval air Some modernization is occurring thanks to development funds from the European Union and the influence of returning migrants but the countryside is still dominated by a traditional agricultural and peasant way of life The land is divided by temperature the northern part Terra Fria Cold Land experiences very harsh winters while Terra Quente Hot Land is more temperate containing large vineyards in the Upper Douro Valley The white almond blossoms in spring are one of the most sublime sights in Portugal The region s overpowering isolation is very evident on curvy backroads where drivers must contend with men straggling along the side with hoes hoisted over their shoulders women carrying bunches of branches and serious looking farmers towing donkey led carts Vila Real and the Southwest Vila Real is the largest town in the region with a population of 30 000 Mostly modern and industrial it sits on the edge of the impressive deep gorge of the River Corgo a tributary of the Douro A scenic way of reaching Vila Real is as a passenger on the narrow gauge train from Peso da R gua see page 68 in the Douro Valley Vila Real itself is somewhat less than fascinating but it s surrounded by several interesting sights nearby and the Alv o and Mar o mountain ranges rise abruptly just outside town making this an excellent base for hiking and climbing At the center of the town is the broad Avenida Carvalho Ara jo where you will find the cathedral and the tourist office in an old mansion If you continue south you will pass the 14th century Capela de S o Bras and be rewarded by a fine view of the gorge The top sight in the area is the magnificent 18th century Baroque manor house known as the Solar de Mateus just 3 km 2 miles from Vila Real The early 18th century Italianate fa ade is familiar to many It appears on bottles of Mateus Ros although there is no connection wine Portugal s long standing top export You can take a guided tour of the interior which has several notable salons and a well stocked library but the exterior and formal gardens are the standout features Chaves and Environs Beyond Vila Real Tr s os Montes becomes noticeably wilder The main road to Chaves follows a scenic route along the valley of the Corgo Vidago is an elegant 19th century spa town 17 km 11 miles before Chaves boasting the Edwardian Palace Hotel gardens and a nine hole golf course The spa is only open in summer Chaves a mere 12 km 7 miles from Spain is a quiet place at least now that it isn t suffering repeated attacks from the invading Spanish The last military attack took place in 1912 but waves of Spanish shoppers still invade the town every weekend in search of bargain prices on a number of goods The town s strategic role as a border crossing is reflected in its name Chaves means Keys and by its two 17th century fortresses the Forte de S o Francisco has been converted into a superior hotel There is also a 14th century keep which today houses an interesting Military Museum Chaves was an important Roman spa town known as Aquae Flaviae and its hot springs good for rheumatism and gout remain open in summer The Romans also built a bridge over the River T mega which is still in use and retains its ancient milestone You can learn more about the town s Roman past in the Museu da Regi o Flaviense Regional Museum on Pra a Cam es The attractive well maintained old town also has several interesting medieval squares and two fine churches Long before the Romans arrived the region s prehistoric inhabitants left a series of carvings on a massive granite boulder at Outeiro Machado 3 km 2 miles outside Chaves The carved symbols are believed to have been associated with rituals involving sacrifice easy to believe in this otherworldly setting Bragan a and the Northeast The route from Chaves to Bragan a is particularly attractive the road winds over mountain passes through pine forests and past the spines of bare rocky hillsides The new and partially completed homes of returned emigrants stand out from the simple houses strung alongside fields still worked by donkey plow Bragan a is a remote outpost but one with a grand history It was here that Catherine of Bragan a the wife of the English king Charles II was born She took with her to England the custom of drinking afternoon tea and control of Bombay thus beginning England s interest in India Catherine s family served as rulers of Portugal between 1640 and 1910 but they preferred their estate at Vila Vi osa in the Alentejo see page 95 to this lonely vastness The town is dominated by its Citadel Cidadela one of the best known in Portugal and by the bleak surrounding hills The fortress encloses a small medieval village of white washed houses where tourists still raise eyebrows The central keep sits on the highest ground and houses an interesting Museu Militar tracing the course of Portuguese military concerns from prehistoric times right through to the colonial wars of the 1970s In front of the keep is Portugal s most curious pelourinho which stands on top of a primitive granite boar porca carved in prehistoric times Also within the castle is Igreja de Santa Maria with its wavy entrance columns and a lovely painted ceiling Next door stands a rare example of a 12th century Meeting House Domus Municipalis the only surviving Romanesque civic building in Portugal It has five sides and the upper floor decorated with Romanesque arches under a timber roof was used for assemblies while the lower floor served as a water cistern In the lower town the unusual Museu Regional Abade de Ba al is located in the former Bishop s Palace The abbot was quite a collector on display are an eclectic mix of local archaeological finds clerical items regional paintings and costumes Two churches worth a look are the Renaissance Igreja de S o Bento with its contrasting ceiling part Moorish carved wood and part trompe l oeil and the Igreja de S o Vicente where Pedro I claimed to have married In s de Castro see page 45 The barren and wild Parque Natural de Montesinho lies between Bragan a and Spain and is home to a number of small isolated villages that have striven to keep up their traditions of communal ownership and pre Christian ritual They share this landscape with wolves and boars For hardcore hikers Montesinho is a delight For details of campsites visit the park office in Bragan a The tiny village of Rio de Onor 24 km 15 miles to the northeast is a village that time forgot and a geographical oddity The town straddles the border half is in Portugal half in Spain where it s called Rihonor de Castilla Locals have long gone back and forth between Portuguese and Spanish with intermarriage between the two nationalities common Miranda do Douro About as far east as you can get in Tr s os Montes Miranda do Douro stands poised at the edge of the great gorge of the Alto Douro Upper Douro Halfway across the modern dam Spain begins Miranda itself is officially a city even though it has only some 2 000 inhabitants Their low white washed houses and cobbled streets were long ago enclosed by walls to keep the Spanish out a purpose that failed in 1762 when a force of French and Spanish troops blew up the castle leaving it a fairly uninspiring ruin The event led Miranda to lose its bishop who decamped to the safety of Bragan a The cold dark and austere 16th century S cathedral remains In the right hand transept in a glass case is a curiosity a small statue of a boy known as the Menino Jesus da Cartolina Sporting hand tailored clothes of a tiny dandy complete with top hat and several sets of Baby Liberace doll clothes at the ready the little figure commemorates a 16th century boy hero who is said to have saved the city from the Spanish Locals believed he was Jesus in disguise On Largo Dom Jo o III at the center of the town is the excellent Museu da Terra de Miranda displaying a selection of traditional Mirand s costumes ancient ritualistic figures furniture and folklore objects Miranda has its own culture and a distinctive dialect Mirand s that freely combines Latin Portuguese Spanish and even some Hebrew The town is also renowned for its festivals and unique sword dancers called the pauliteiros The gorge itself is about 2 km 1 mile away down a twisting road The rocky hillsides on both sides of the dam are home to some 80 species of birds as well as flocks of sheep Cruise boats on the dammed side of the gorge take trips upriver On the other side of the dam the river snakes its way through port wine country down to Porto Central and Southeastern Tr s os Montes Mirandela is a pleasant town at the hub of the region s road system 54 km 33 miles southeast of Chaves 64 km 40 miles southwest of Bragan a and 70 km 43 miles northeast of Vila Real The town lies among orchards in the valley of the Tua river The bridge over the river is a 15th century construction built on a Roman base The old town of cobbled streets is dominated by the 17th century town hall home of the T vora family until the Marqu s de Pombal had them all executed on a trumped up charge of treason The Modern Art Gallery is worth a visit Halfway between Vila Real and Mirandela is the small town of Mur a most famous for its prehistoric carved stone pig which can be found on a platform in the main square of the town Farther south and east in the Upper Douro region the climate is noticeably warmer The eccentrically named town of Freixo do Espada Cinta Ash Tree of the Belted Sword is where according to legend the 13th century Dom Dinis hung his sword He also built the town s seven sided tower The town has an enviable collection of Manueline buildings and attracts hordes of visitors during the spring to see flowering almond blossoms in the local orchards The impressive Igreja de Matriz the parish church was rebuilt in 1520 in the Manueline style and has a magnificent painting attributed to Gr o Vasco see page 56 Alentejo The land beyond the Tagus alem Tejo in Arabic is a hot and dusty plain sheathed in wheat olive and cork trees separating Lisbon from the Algarve Though it frequently gets passed over by those hell bent on getting to the southern beaches the Alentejo is one of Portugal s most fascinating and historic regions Although it accounts for approximately one third of the country s land area these vast sun baked plains are sparsely populated The slow moving lifestyle has given rise to jokes about its equally slow inhabitants such as the one about the Alentejano who keeps an empty bottle in the fridge for his friends who don t drink In fact the Alentejo is far more sophisticated and varied than it may first appear with an excellent wine making tradition large aristocratic estates and some of the country s historic cities such as vora Massive medieval fortresses stand watch atop steep hills along the Spanish border and ancient dolmens megalithic stones dot the countryside And for those who absolutely must see the Atlantic the Alentejo has its own costa the Costa Azul or Blue Coast a lower key version of the Algarve vora vora 150 km 93 miles east of Lisbon is the acclaimed star of the Alentejo Originally a Roman settlement and center of learning vora is now a city of splendid Renaissance buildings mostly dating from its heyday as the base of the House of Aviz rulers of Portugal from the 14th century until the Spanish Hapsburgs took over in 1581 By the 17th century vora had lost influence and development came to a halt preserving the city s distinctive 16th century pal cios for posterity The major sights are enclosed within two rings of concentric walls and tucked among vora s great maze of Moorish alleys and squares pra as The distinctive main square Pra a do Giraldo is marked by Moorish arches and an attractive 16th century fountain in its center The tourist office is located here vora s Templo Romano Roman Temple sometimes called the Temple of Diana dates to the 2nd or 3rd century ad Its 14 Corinthian columns rise skyward from a platform that was in use as recently as the 19th century as a slaughterhouse Next to the Temple is the elegant Pousada dos L ios see page 178 a state owned inn that was formerly a convent Abutting the pousada is the privately owned church of S o Jo o Evangelista also known as L ios the old church of the same convent Inside are some of the country s finest examples of azulejo tilework created in the 18th century by the celebrated artist Ant nio Oliveira Bernardes and depicting the life of S o Louren o St Lawrence The church holds several other surprises Hidden beneath trapdoors on either side of the aisle are a Moorish cistern 15 m 50 ft deep and a collection of monks bones in the ossuary There are also confession holes that open onto the pousada s cloister from where you can spy on diners The nearby S Cathedral begun in 1186 betrays its crusading origins with its fortress like Romanesque style Note the statues of the Twelve Apostles by the door and their odd gargoyle friends The impressive eastern wing was rebuilt by Friedrich Ludwig the architect of the Convent at Mafra see page 42 using the multicolored marble of the Alentejo The cathedral has an especially beautiful Gothic cloister and Sacred Art Museum with an extraordinary impressive collection of relics and clerical vestments The upper choir is exquisitely carved with a great Renaissance organ dating to 1562 one of the oldest in Europe The Igreja de S o Fransisco holds one of vora s greatest and most macabre attractions the Capela dos Ossos Chapel of Bones The chapel is a large room wholly constructed with the bones of 5 000 monks skulls form the window frames and femurs cover the columns Over the entrance is a spooky sign that reminds visitors of their own mortality N s ossos que aqui estamos Pelos vossos esperamos We bones that are here await the arrival of yours The Museu de vora not far from the cathedral is housed in the old archbishop s palace It has an important collection of paintings by the Flemish inspired Portuguese School the finest being a polyptych of 13 panels depicting the Life of the Virgin from the early 15th late 16th century The altarpiece was removed from the S in 1717 The museum also contains an eclectic mix of stone sculptures including some Roman tombstones several Arab votive inscriptions and medieval tomb carvings There are several other churches and houses of interest as well as the old university but beyond its admirable register of historical monuments vora remains a thoroughly charming small city to stroll and take in at a leisurely pace Rua 5 de Outubro a long thoroughfare leading to Pra a do Giraldo is the main shopping street Rest of the Alentejo The fine white washed town of Arraiolos 21 km 13 miles north of vora is famed for its carpet workshops The town s handwoven wool rugs in the Moorish Persian style have been made here since the 17th century While they aren t cheap though cheaper here than elsewhere they are extremely beautiful Another excellent day trip from vora is to the megaliths near Reguengos de Monsaraz 36 km 22 miles to the southeast These baffling prehistoric monuments or dolmens consist of standing stones menhirs and stone circles cromlechs that look like spin offs from Stonehenge ask the tourist office in vora for a pamphlet on these and other dolmens in the area as well as for precise directions Near the Spanish border is Monsaraz a quietly stunning fortified hilltop village with cobbled streets and spectacular views over the plains The castle now occasionally hosting bullfights is one in the long chain of fortifications built by Dom Dinis in the 14th century The Marble Towns About 46 km 28 miles northeast of vora marble supplants more mundane building materials for churches and palaces thanks to the great number of quarries found at Estremoz Borba and Vila Vi osa The largest of these quarries is near Estremoz a walled town full of gleaming white marble stretching above the plains The Rossio Pra a Marqu s de Pombal forms the heart of the lower town and is home to the hustle and bustle of a Saturday market one of the region s liveliest where you can buy the famous pottery of Estremoz tasty local cheese and any of the other agricultural products of the Alentejo There is a tourist office on the square as well as an interesting Museu Rural Rural Museum displaying a wealth of idiosyncratic local gadgets and pottery Also here is the beautiful marble faced C mara Municipal Town Hall converted from an old convent with impressive azulejo panels The upper town is reached through medieval walls Lording over the town is the 13th century Torre das Tr s Coroas castle keep or Tower of Three Crowns visible for miles around Inside is the azulejo covered chapel of Rainha Santa Isabel dedicated to the memory of Dom Dinis s sainted queen To one side is the white marble Royal Palace now one of the country s finest and most in demand pousadas Borba on the road to Elvas and Spain is more down to earth though its marble buildings betray the source of the local wealth The people of Borba make their living from extracting marble from quarries as well as producing fine red and white wines Every November the town hosts a gregarious wine festival Just up the road 6 km 4 miles away is a third marble town Vila Vi osa The pretty town is most remarkable for its impressive 16th century Pa o Ducal Ducal Palace of the Bragan a family the last of Portugal s royal dynasties The Pa o used to be the favorite country house of the family who often preferred hunting in the enormous surrounding park to the fuss of Lisbon or the cold of their palace in Bragan a in northern Portugal see page 84 The guided tour in Portuguese only provides an intimate glimpse of the royal apartments as they would have appeared before the assassination of Carlos I in 1908 Next door to the palace is the pousada in a gorgeously restored 16th century convent Further east and nearer to Spain is the mighty frontier fortress town of Elvas The castle walls among the best preserved in Portugal were modernized in the 17th century and given the characteristic star shape that distinguishes the work of Vauban the French military architect From the ramparts are superb views of the Portuguese plains and Spain across the border Nearby is the oldest section of town with steep cobblestoned streets and hanging laundry Extending from the city s walls is the Aqueduto da Amoreira an aqueduct some 7 km 4 miles long that took 124 years to complete The town s largest church on Pra a da Rep blica is the richly painted Nossa Senhora da Assun o with an elaborate Manueline portal and belltower overlooking the square Nossa Senhora dos Aflitos another church closer to the castle has an octagonal shape that reflects the influence of the architecture of the Knights Templar and the remarkable dome is covered in beautiful 17th century azulejos Northeastern Alentejo Portalegre is the prosperous no nonsense capital of the northern Alentejo located near the hills and neolithic monuments of the Serra de S o Mamede 59 km 36 miles north of Estremoz Its past wealth based on carpet and silk production accounts for the graceful 18th century mansions lining the Rua 19 de Junho By far the most interesting sight in town though is the F brica Real de Tape arias Tapestry Factory housed in a 17th century Jesuit school where dozens of women use great handlooms to weave carpets from thousands of different shades of wool Horse fans should be sure to visit Alter do Ch o 33 km 20 miles southeast of Portalegre the location of the Coudelaria de Alter Real Royal Stud Farm where Portugal s finest horses are bred If you arrive in the morning you can watch the Lusitanian and Alter do Ch o horses being fed There is also an interesting museum and the town has a fine restored castle Fl r da Rosa and Crato are two small agricultural towns west of Portalegre In the former is one of the best examples of how the state pousada chain is adapting modern architecture to historic buildings The inn now occupying the 14th century Convento de Fl r da Rosa is extraordinary Outside of town on the road to Aldeia da Mata is one of the best preserved dolmens in Portugal a mysterious prehistoric chamber sitting unobtrusively in rolling pastoral lands In Crato is a stately square with an interesting Varanda do Gr o Prior with stone arches under a terrace once used for outdoor Mass and a municipal museum of local handicrafts and artifacts two doors down Above town are the curious ruins of the castle now undergoing extensive restoration North of Portalegre is the pleasant town Castelo de Vide whose 14th century castle is surrounded by gleaming houses that nuzzle against the steeply sloping hill Further down the hill the winding alleyways of the Judiaria Jewish Quarter have survived and make a great place for wandering Among these houses is the country s oldest surviving synagogue dating from the 13th century For centuries the fresh springs at Fonte de Vila close to the handsome main square the Pra a Dom Pedro V have been another of Castelo de Vide s many attractions A steep winding road leads to the dramatically situated medieval walled village Marv o Perched on an outcrop overlooking Spain the easygoing town is the highest in Portugal at 862 m 2 800 ft The 13th century castle walls appear woven right into the natural rock the views from atop the ramparts of both the white washed town and surrounding area are stunning It s not hard to understand why the fortress proved virtually impenetrable Marv o has almost all the charm of bidos see page 43 but without the slickness or tour bus crowds Just outside the castle entrance is a handsome Museu Municipal with nice archaeological finds religious artifacts and altarpieces and regional costumes Baixo Lower Alentejo Of Roman origin it was a regional capital under Julius Caesar the agricultural city of Beja 78 km 48 miles south of vora is at the hub of roads that lead to Lisbon the Algarve and across the Alentejo The old town is particularly attractive The decoratively crenellated Torre de Menagem in the castle dates to the 13th century and provides a good lookout over the extensive wheatfields of the region The city s most interesting sight is the Convento de Nossa Senhora da Concei o with its fine Manueline carving bright Moorish style azulejos splendid Baroque chapel and an explosion of rococo gold leaf The former convent houses an interesting regional museum with a good archaeological and painting collection There is also a unique Museu Visig tico Visigothic Art Museum in Santo Amaro Beja s oldest church The new Pousada de S o Fransisco has been admirably converted from another convent once derelict The charming sleepy town of Serpa rises neatly above the plains 30 km 18 miles east of Beja on the route to Spain Beyond the formidable Porta da Beja a monumental gate in the city wall small streets wend among bright white houses Many of the buildings hide small cheese factories which produce Serpa s famous ewe s milk cheese The town s castle was partially destroyed by a Spanish attack in 1707 but still affords enjoyable views The walls continue past a privately owned 17th century mansion and on to a slender aqueduct which ends in an ancient well with a working chain pulley system for drawing water A small ethnographic museum displays the wares of the agricultural and industrial workers of the area From Serpa a rewarding drive takes you south toward the eastern Algarve through a hilly and sparsely populated landscape where shepherds tend their flocks Along the way is M rtola an ancient white washed town founded by the Phoenicians built up by the Romans and later seized by the Moors Perched on a ridge at the junction of the River Guadiana and the smaller Oeiras the town is protected by Moorish walls and topped by a rather dilapidated castle with a profusion of storks nests M rtola bursts with history Its church the Igreja Matriz betrays a previous incarnation as a mosque with a prayer niche mihrab while the town hall now a museum is constructed on Roman foundations The Guadiana River continues as far as the Algarve forming part of the border with Spain The road that follows its banks is one of the most beautiful access routes between the Alentejo and the Algarve Coastal Alentejo The Alentejo coast a popular holiday destination with the Portuguese has a character slightly different from that of the even more popular Algarve The water here is colder and the winds and waves greater but it is also noticeably quieter more relaxed and less expensive Often the best beaches are those near a river estuary thus giving visitors the choice of surfing in the Atlantic or swimming in the calmer waters of the river The northernmost point of the coastal Alentejo is the narrow sandy peninsula of Tr ia 46 km 28 miles northwest of the attractive town of Alc cer do Sal Tr ia has beaches on both the Sado estuary and the ocean but the town has been heavily developed in recent years to accommodate ferries from Set bal see page 41 Even so it is worth visiting the remains of the Roman fishing village of Cetobriga You can escape the crowds on the beaches of the ocean side Further to the south and slightly inland is the town of Santiago do Cac m hemmed in by low lying hills on three sides and crowned by a hilltop castle which holds a macabre cemetery full of disinterred bones Scattered about the surrounding hills is a profusion of windmill towers which without their white canvas sails look for all the world like ancient cannons The lagoons of Santo Andr and Melides are both easily accessible from Santiago do Cac m and boast long stretches of beach ocean and lagoon swimming and small beachside communities THE ALGARVE To many international visitors the Algarve is Portugal but the Portuguese see the Algarve as a distinct anomaly The area s distinctive character owes much to its strong Moorish heritage and its Mediterranean climate so different from most other parts of the country The region s popularity with millions of vacationers has produced an explosion of purpose built holiday villages The Algarve is blessed with a number of spectacular beaches a wonderfully sunny climate many excellent sporting facilities and even a handful of quiet and untouristed areas Access from one part of the Algarve to another is along the EN125 road which runs most of the length of the coast The section of coast stretching from Faro eastwards to Spain known as the Sotavento Coast is made up of salt marshes and lagoons with beautiful sandy beaches on the barrier islands just offshore The most intensively developed part stretches westward from Faro to Portim o Here the long beaches are all backed by scores of busy large scale tourist resorts The more dramatic Barlavento Coast extends west from Portim o and is characterized by a twisting shoreline indented with coves and wind sculpted cliffs The coast comes to an end at Cabo S o Vicente known to the medieval Portuguese as the End of the World The west coast of the Algarve is wilder colder windier and considerably emptier even though it has its fair share of wonderful beaches Inland you ll find Roman and Moorish monuments numerous fruit orchards and the scenic wooded hillsides of the serras that separate the Algarve from the Alentejo Barlavento Coast The hardscrabble town of Sagres and the area around it are remote rugged and desert like with only a relative smattering of hotels restaurants and other facilities aimed at tourists It is like the Algarve s outpost which is precisely why it has so many admirers Prince Henry the Navigator established his Navigation School here though some protest that it was farther east near Lagos The town has a picturesque working harbor and a cute little square Pra a Rep blica and is ringed by informal and in summer hopping nightspots The best beaches near Sagres Mareta Martinhal Beliche Tonel and Telheiro are sheltered and not overcrowded Beyond the village of Sagres a great rocky peninsula hangs above a brooding ocean Henry and his sailors are said to have set up camp at the Fortaleza de Sagres fortress that sits on the promontory though little of the original structure has survived Inside is a small 16th century chapel Nossa Senhora da Gra a and what looks to be a huge stone sun dial known as the Rosa dos Ventos rose compass A couple of kilometers one mile west of Sagres are the more authentic remains of another fortress Fortaleza do Beliche At the tip of the windswept cliffs of Cabo de S o Vicente the lighthouse built in 1904 on the site of a convent chapel has a beam visible up to 96 km 60 miles away Lagos the principal resort of the western Algarve is the rare beach town that offers something for everyone By night Lagos is lively with outdoor restaurant terraces and bars and by day it combines a rich historical past with a busy present Attractive beaches are on the outskirts of town so it is not a classic resort in the mold of Praia da Rocha The well restored fortress Forte da Ponte da Bandeira once guarded the entrance to the harbor in the 17th century Many of the streets rising towards the top of town are narrow cobbled and more accustomed to donkeys than rental cars Though Lagos town still retains a good part of its original walls most of them from the 16th century but part Roman in places they have been rebuilt and expanded over the centuries Lagos was an important trading port under the Moors but the town enjoyed its heyday after the Reconquest when it was proclaimed the capital of the Algarve On Rua General Alberta da Silveira the tiny chapel Igreja de Santo Ant nio an exuberant gilt Baroque work and one of the Algarve s finest churches was rebuilt soon after the earthquake The entrance to the church is actually through the curious and eclectic museum next door Museu Regional de Lagos Rooms display sacred art archaeological remains the original charter of Lagos holy vestments and a bizarre collection of creatures like a science experiment gone bad an eight legged goat kid preserved in formaldehyde a one eyed sheep a cat with two faces The main street of Lagos is the charming cobbled Rua 25 de Abril packed with restaurants bars and antiques and ceramics shops The beaches near Lagos range from Meia Praia 1 6 km 1 mile to the east a long 4 km 2 miles flat stretch to pocket sized coves just west of the city Weird and wonderful rock formations and steep cliffs that glow orange at sunset have made them some of the most photographed in Europe head for Praia de Dona Ana and Praia do Camilo both small pretty and crowded street signs indicate the way to each At the southern tip just before the road turns west to Sagres are the coast s most spectacular sights Ponta da Piedade Point of Piety is the mother of all stack and cliff formations along the Algarve a stunning terracotta family of bridges terraces and grottoes Portim o second only to Faro in size in the Algarve is the most workmanlike town on the coast But nestled around it are some of the Algarve s finest beaches and that has transformed the area into one of the coast s most popular resorts Praia da Rocha and Praia Tr s Irm os in particular are lined with hotels and beach goers Most of Portim o s local color is down by the port a haven of fishing activity The top fish canning spot on the Algarve Portim o is renowned for its restaurants specializing in sardinhas grelhadas grilled sardines In the center of town Largo 1 de Dezembro is a 19th century park with 10 splendid blue and white azulejo benches each illustrating a pivotal event in the history of Portugal Along Rua Machado dos Santos is the handsome Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Concei o sitting atop a small hill and incline of steps The yellow and white church originally constructed in the 15th century has a beautiful Gothic portico with carved capitals though it looks like a colonial church you might find in Brazil due to its reconstruction and remodeling in the 18th and 19th centuries From the center of town head to the waterfront especially if it s anywhere near time for lunch or dinner You can almost follow your nose toward the heady aroma of grilled sardines It will take you to the dockside lined with simple restaurants one after the other all serving an abundance of delicious smoky sardines and other fresh caught fish Just 3 km 2 miles down river from Portim o is Praia da Rocha which became a holiday village for wealthy Portuguese families back at the end of the 19th century It was discovered by the British in the 1930s when this beach of rocks strewn with extravagantly shaped eroded stacks provided an inspirational refuge for writers and intellectuals The long 2 km 1 mile golden beach remains the main attraction At the very eastern end of the resort guarding the River Arade is the historic Fortaleza de Santa Catarina de Ribamar St Catherine s Fortress built in 1621 to defend Silves and Portim o against the Moors The opposite end of Praia da Rocha s long stretch is known as Praia do Vau The splendid rock formations and coves continue but this end of the beach is quieter and less developed than the eastern end Just west Praia de Tr s Irm os is the slightly upscale beach cousin of Praia da Rocha The eastern end of the beach is a beautiful cove hemmed in by cliffs and ochre rocks Beyond it the beach stretches to Alvor a classic Algarvian fishermen s village Narrow cobbled streets plunge downhill to a quay and market where boats bob at anchor on a wide marshy lagoon At the top of the hill on Rua da Igreja is Igreja Matriz a charming 16th century church with a delicately carved Manueline portico perhaps the finest on the Algarve North of Portim o and extending across the western half of the province is the Serra de Monchique a mountain range that protects the coast from the hot plains farther north The serra is a verdant landscape of cork pine and chestnut trees and low lying areas are covered in blankets of colorful wildflowers The first stop on the scenic journey along route 266 is the spa village of Caldas de Monchique known since Roman times for its therapeutic waters North of Caldas the road weaves uphill quickly rising 300 m 1 000 ft in 5 km 3 miles past terraced farmlands and forests of eucalyptus oak and cork Monchique is a small market town known for its handicrafts and the famous Manueline portico of its 16th century Igreja Matriz The road continues upwards towards F ia almost 915 m 3 000 ft above sea level affording one of the best views in southern Portugal On a clear day you can see from the bay of Portim o to the Sagres peninsula and pick out the rocky outcrops of the Lagos beaches Silves is the former Moorish capital of the Algarve More than eight centuries ago Silves then known as Chelb was one of the strongest outposts in 12th century Arab Iberia a magnificent city with palaces gardens bazaars and a huge red castle on a hill Silves is now just a dusty backwater but the glorious setting remains The Castelo dos Mouros Moors Castle took shape after the Reconquest though it preserves distinctly Moorish lines Next to the castle is the impressive Gothic S Velha Old Cathedral of Silves built by the liberating Christian crusaders Opposite the S is the 16th century Igreja da Miseric rdia with a classic Manueline style side door The imposing Torre o da Porta da Cidade Turret of the City Gate gives you a good idea of how seriously defense of the city was taken The charming resort of Carvoeiro an archetypal small Barlavento resort has a tiny beach at the bottom of a pretty valley The original village of Carvoeiro is now fairly commercialized but to many people it remains one of the coast s most attractive resorts Inland just off the main road is the attractive little village of Porches with some classic white Algarvian houses and filigreed chimneys Porches is famous throughout Port ugal for its hand painted pottery though you won t find much in the village itself The shops of greatest renown are along the EN 125 route One of the most photographed beaches along this stretch is Nossa Senhora da Rocha Our Lady of the Rock The rock in question is a promontory boldly jutting out into the sea surmounted by a little white fishermen s church The beach of Arma o de P ra is one of the longest in the Algarve a flat golden stretch to the east picturesque rock stacks and small coves to the west The massive development on the east end of town though has pretty much run roughshod over the natural beauty of the area all but eclipsing the former fishing village Albufeira at one time a picturesque fishermen s town has grown wildly in recent years to become the leading resort in the Algarve Its cliff top position and labyrinthine street plan provided an easily defensible spot for the Moors and Albufeira proved one of the last towns to fall during the Reconquest Modern Albufeira has fallen prey to mass tourism bars caf s and nightspots pump out music day and night The excellent beaches west of town are relatively uncrowded The best are S o Rafael and Coelha Castelo and Gal three small beautiful coves One of the most picturesque towns in the province is the lovely village Alte about 30 km 18 miles north of Albufeira The architectural highlight of the village is the beautiful 16th century Igreja Matriz entered through a classic Manueline portal The rest of Alte is the Algarve of picture postcards white washed houses along narrow streets colorful windows filigreed chimney pots and red tiled roofs Loosely grouped with Albufeira are beaches to the east Here the coastline features the last of the dramatic rock formations that have made the Algarve so famous Fal sia is a beautiful beach framed by high cliffs but to get to it you need to negotiate the grounds of the Sheraton Algarve whose elevator down to the beach is for guests only There are more excellent beaches at Santa Eulalia Balaia Praia da Oura and S o Jo o The center of activity along this beach hinterland is the infamous strip a long street of bustling bars restaurants and nightspots leading up to the hilltop area known as Montechoro Nearby Vilamoura is a wholly planned and sanitized tourist undertaking with high rise hotels and sprawling villas that line manicured golf courses to the 19th hole club bar and the Algarve s biggest marina It s a major draw for those who have their clubs ready for a golfing vacation several of the Algarve s best courses have been sculpted out of the area A little farther west Quarteira once a quiet fishing village is today virtually unrecognizable subsumed under an onslaught of rows and rows of apartment buildings East of Vilamoura and Quarteira the terrain begins to change The rugged rocky lines of the Barlavento coast west of Faro give way to long flat beaches of the east The small crossroads town of Almancil has shops caf s and businesses many of which are dedicated to serving English expatriates A few miles south on the coast are two of the Algarve s most luxurious and exclusive resorts Vale do Lobo and Quinta do Lago Vale do Lobo is a maze like villa community with a nice beach and a variety of golf and tennis resort hotels Quinta do Lago a few miles down the coast has one of the finest golf courses on the Algarve designed delicately along the Ria Formosa Nature Preserve The beach can be reached across a long nostalgic wooden bridge that crosses over wetlands and bird sanctuaries Back toward Almancil is one of the Algarve s top attractions About 16 km 10 miles west of Faro a simple white church stands out on a small hill overlooking the thundering highway A sign simply says S Louren o indicating the turn off to S o Louren o do Matto Church of St Lawrence of the Woods Inside is one of the most extraordinary displays of azulejo design you ll ever see Every square inch of the Baroque 15th century church its walls vaulted ceiling and cupola is covered with hand painted blue and white ceramic tiles Most date from the early 18th century and depict biblical scenes detailing the life of St Lawrence The ensemble is a stunning sight not to be missed Loul north of Almancil is a prosperous town known for its leather lace and copper goods Tour groups come from far and wide to shop at the colorful bustling market Just below the permanent market halls on the main Pra a da Rep blica you ll find a well preserved section of the medieval castle walls which were much damaged by the 1755 earthquake Also worth visiting are the Igreja Matriz S o Clemente a 13th century Gothic church with 18th century azulejo tiles the Convento da Gra a with a terrific Manueline portal and Ermida de Nossa Senhora da Concei o a small church prized for its Baroque altar and ceramic tiles In the streets directly below the castle walls you may well hear the sounds of craftsmen beating copper from whom you can buy direct If you are in the Algarve in springtime don t miss the Loul Carnival The parades Battle of Flowers and musical celebrations are the best of their kind in the region S o Br s de Alportel is another market town and site of one of only two government pousadas inns along the Algarve in the midst of rolling orchards of fig olive and orange trees You may wish to pay a visit to the charming Museu Etnogr fico do Trajo Alg rvio Museum of Algarvian Costumes where exhibits of local dress are well staged in a large old house 90 m 100 yds or so off the main square On the road toward Faro is a pair of historical sights The Pal cio de Est i is a most curious find The charming Rococo palace found through a small side gate just to the left of the church steps in the town center once belonged to the Dukes of Est i Begun in the mid 18th century it s now abandoned and visibly dilapidated and only the gardens are open to the public Yet it is a spectacular sight Its faded glory includes balustrade terraces and staircases with splendid bursts of bougainvillea busts of historic characters impaled on the parapets brightly colored wall tiles and formal gardens The Portuguese government aims to construct a pousada inn here The dusty Villa Romana de Milreu Roman ruins of Milreu are 1 5 km 1 mile down the road from the village toward Faro a small sign on the side of the road reads Ruinas de Milreu The tall semi circular tower ruin is thought to have been a temple to pagan water gods at one time however by the fifth century it had clearly been converted to a church Faro the provincial capital of the Algarve is bypassed by many tourists though the town has a greater wealth of cultural and historic monuments than any other Algarvian town and a picturesque old quarter The main entrance to the circular old town near the harbor is the 19th century Arco da Vila a charming arch and bell tower Beyond the arch a cobbled street worn slick by centuries of tramping feet leads up to the splendid expanse of the Largo da S Cathedral Square best seen in the evening when floodlit and free of cars The S s unusual cathedral tower main portico and two interior chapels are all that remain of the original 13th century Gothic building Inside is one of the Algarve s most important collections of 17th and 18th century sacred art Climb the tower for fine views over the whole of Faro The Convento de Nossa Senhora da Assun o Convent of Our Lady of the Assumption the first Renaissance building in the Algarve contains what is arguably the most beautiful cloister in southern Portugal The convent has been beautifully restored as a museum devoted to archaeology the Museu Arqueol gico Infante Dom Henrique The principal exhibit is a 2 000 year old Roman floor mosaic measuring 9 m 30 ft long and 3 m 10 ft wide Central Faro s main thoroughfare is Rua de Santo Ant nio At its far end is the Museu Etnogr fico Ethnographic Museum with displays of local handicrafts and reconstructions of rooms in a typical Algarvian house The museum sits on the edge of Faro s Mouraria or old Moorish quarter The new town an expansion dating from the 19th century is west of here Igreja de S o Pedro Church of St Peter built in the 16th century has a carved Baroque retable and a couple of Rococo chapels But Faro s finest church is Igreja do Carmo Carmelite Church The promise of its twin belltowers and stately fa ade is matched by a beautiful gilded interior but the greatest attraction is the macabre Capela dos Ossos Chapel of Bones This 19th century curiosity like a similar chapel in the town of vora farther north is constructed of the skulls and bones of monks unearthed from the friars cemetery Depending on your tolerance for such things it is either fascinating or sick beyond belief The Sotavento Coast Heading east from the provincial capital of Faro the first settlement of any size you will come to is the colorful fishing town of Olh o Olh o used to be described as the little white Cubist town of the Algarve its architecture likened to that of North African towns The parish church which also goes by the name of Nossa Senhora do Ros rio was founded by King Dom Pedro II in 1698 The small chapel at the rear Nossa Senhora dos Aflitos Our Lady of the Afflicted is where women often pray when their fishermen husbands are away at sea Instead of the red tiled roofs and filigreed chimneys seen elsewhere in the Algarve the Olh o skyline comprises flat topped roofs of terraces called a oeitas The Olh o fish market is one of the Algarve s best especially famous for its mussels and other shellfish With its triumverate of Moorish Reconquista and Renaissance roots clearly visible Tavira one of the true gems of the Algarve is one of the region s most historically rich cities In the 1500s Tavira had the largest population on the Algarve This tuna fishing port with its self assured town of historic churches imposing classical style mansions and beautiful riverfront gardens probably dates back ar least as far as the Phoenicians or the Carthaginians In fact its seven arched stone bridge of Roman origin is still in use Tavira s castle in the center of the casco hist rico old quarter was a defensive structure built by the Moors The walls look directly onto the Igreja de Santa Maria do Castelo Church of St Mary of the Castle most likely built on the site of the old mosque The Gothic portal is the only original 13th century element of the building to have survived the devastating 1755 earthquake Across the square the ochre colored former convent Convento da Gra a is being converted into a pousada inn by the Portuguese government Just down the hill off Rua Galeria near the river is the beautiful 16th century Igreja da Miseric rdia Church of Mercy a spectacular Renaissance edifice with a carved portico Rua da Liberdade Tavira s main street is lined with stately 16th century mansions A nice excursion from Tavira is to the nearby island Ilha de Tavira where there is a huge and thoroughly appealing beach backed by sand dunes Jetties leave from a point Quatro guas a couple of kilometers one mile east of town Back on the mainland a turn off of the main road east EN 125 still of Tavira leads a small number of visitors to Cacela Velha a perfectly enchanting little white washed village overlooking the sea It has an 18th century church a telephone booth a cemetery an old well and a handful of well tended blue and white houses festooned with flowers East of here lie the high rise canyons of Monte Gordo The raison d tre of all the development is a long but not especially attractive sandy beach which stretches undisturbed for some 10 km 6 miles The Guadiana River which runs into the Atlantic 3 km 2 miles east of Monte Gordo served as a natural frontier for some 2 000 years forming the boundary between the Roman provinces of Lusitania Portugal and Baetica southern Spain This geographical context explains the strategic importance of Castro Marim a fortress town occupied by the Moors for five centuries A little to the south the sleepy but quietly dignified town of Vila Real de Santo Ant nio the Royal Town of St Anthony is the last of the Algarve s beach towns before Spain The town was built from scratch in just five months in 1774 aping the grid layout of Lisbon s Baixa lower city The town square Pra a do Marqu s do Pombal is the tour de force of Vila Real with black and white pavement radiating from an obelisk in the center of the square like rays from the sun Vila Real de Santo Ant nio s main appeal is the ferry to Ayamonte across the water in Spain The trip takes just 20 minutes less time than it would take to drive to and over the new bridge and the white town of Ayamonte is a fine sight as you approach it from the river Crossing into Spain you will need to take your passport North from Sagres along the west coast is the one part of the Algarve that may well escape intensive development simply because although the beaches are pleasant and the coastline dramatic the water is colder and the wind stronger For those interested in surfing or solitude this coast may be ideal Aljezur s ruined Moorish castle looks over the town which makes a good base for neighboring beaches such as the enormous rocky cove at Arrifana and the wider dune beach of Monte Clerigo both of which also have their own small tourist complexes Further north Odeceixe is a pretty village set in a small river valley which continues down to a wide cliff backed beach at the estuary
