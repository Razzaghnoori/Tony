 do you have a favorite basketball team Lakers the Lakers LA yes i m from LA okay uh how they doing this year i m not i haven t even been following them very much they re okay they re not um out of anything yet they re still hanging in there i know they lost recently to the Bucks in Milwaukee yeah that s that s where i m from so yeah yeah that s about the i like the Lakers and uh Mavericks are okay but they they got a lot of problems Mavericks do have problems without Roy Tarpley they re not going anywhere and see i don t think they should build up on one person like Chicago with you know with Michael Air Jordan and that s not good Lakers got so many different players yeah they do they always seem to get the talent there um hum i guess that s why i like them well they i think yeah i think Milwaukee got lucky because Magic Johnson sat out that game yeah yep i m not too much of a basketball fan but you know i watch a lot i watch different games like uh huh play off games and stuff like that do you think the Lakers can win the championship this year no not since they re coach is gone you don t like Mike Dunleavy no yeah he didn t they didn t let him have quite the the flair that uh Mike Riley had huh uh Mike Riley was it and that s well Dunleavy s a good coach though he was he s good it s just he s not he s not Riley and i think that s the biggest problem is eventually they re going to have to figure out what they need to do and catch on to each other yeah well he doesn t have that Hollywood attitude huh uh would uh no i m pretty familiar with with Dunleavy because he was an assistant at Milwaukee oh was he uh yeah and he uh when when they had uh injury problems with some of their major players uh he actually put on a uniform and went out and played oh my goodness they they signed him to a ten day contract and uh he became a player even though he s assistant coach huh uh that s all right then the guy knows basketball i think he ll do all right for the Lakers huh boy you you like basketball though don t you oh yeah oh yeah it s fun i m watching the i m i m busy watching the NC double A tournament uh the past couple weeks uh huh and the NIT semifinals are on tonight yeah see now i watch the the Final Four uh huh once it gets down to like the Final Four yeah right so are any of those teams of interest to you UNLV i like them oh yeah well they re they re just i guess because well that guy is from Dallas that s probably about the only thing yeah that s it that s the only reason why i don t know anybody else Larry Johnson right well they re just head and shoulders above everybody else this year are they really oh yeah they re they re so much better than anybody else it s uh that they re prohibitive favorites in winning all their games but then you know just like that man said in this final in these in the NCAA whatever it is the little play off games they play so many sometimes i do think it s going to be more it s luck and ambition you know right well it s it s just unbelievable how many games they play in in college now Arkansas played thirty four games this year that s almost half of a pro season yeah see that s that s too many games it s too many for students you know and and then they supposed to be studying right you know they re talking tonight about this NIT game with Stanford and Massachusetts that the Stanford players actually took their final exams while they were on the road playing basketball uh huh are you serious they have an honor system there where they would they had uh three hours to take their exams they sent them in by uh by fax and uh i guess by they used laptop computers to uh to get their exams finished uh huh hum send them out by Federal Express and fax machine i don t think that s good yeah it s incredible that uh that they have to do that i mean some of the the schools give you a break they give the students a break where they can take their exams when they get back from from a tournament uh huh but uh these guys were actually on the road uh two thousand miles from from home when they had to file their uh their final exams and send them in yeah i don t think that s i don t think that s good yeah that and then you know the laptop that s how i guess they really stuck it on a disk the teacher you know with no answers and they could take it like that and then just print it out in fax and it would be okay because you can put it on a you know on diskette yeah and just have them take it but then who s helping them yep i don t know so do you think uh you think Vegas is going to win the finals then see now that s yep i think so too they plaid Duke and uh Duke has a lot to uh to atone for here last year that lost to Vegas in the finals by thirty points in that the other one that upset that was an upset was Kansas last night Kansas is a real surprise i didn t expect them to get that far when they yeah i didn t think they was going to beat that team i don t remember the team but they shouldn t have beat them uh they beat Arkansas yeah i didn t uh yeah that that i like i like Arkansas Arkansas just uh they had a rough second half yeah they came out uh real hot in the first half Todd Davis hitting his three pointers and it was like they just died or something you know yeah uh somebody took the fire out from under them they they weren t getting their shots anymore huh uh and and Kansas just crept up on them and uh uh it was unbelievable because they they did that a few years ago too when they were seated a lot lower and they won the the championship that s it um hum see now that s the that s the thing now but i don t think they everybody s waiting for UNLV yeah well they they are just that much better they ve got so many stars and see if Kansas if Kansas yeah but then you know it could be what if they re not hitting that night or they re low or anything and see i i feel like the college you know it s kids it s still kids well sure i think anybody can can win on a given night but they have so much talents and the average age on that team is twenty two years old they ve got a lot of fifth year seniors that are playing so yeah they just take them out think that that d be all right guys that are playing for long time uh they re playing Duke uh this weekend uh the average age on Duke s team is nineteen years old um hum um hum Vegas the average age is over twenty two so they ve got just so much more experience than anybody else in the tournament right now but they re going to lose all those guys at the end of the season they re going to all turn pro i think Stacy Augmon s a senior and Larry Johnson i don t think i think he s uh is he a senior or junior yeah who i m not Larry Johnson i think he s coming out this year he s yeah he s coming out in the pros this year uh huh and Anderson Hunt all their uh their best players i think are graduating um hum well maybe not graduating but at least they ll be entering the the pro draft i don t i think i think he s going to move i think he ll probably go he now Larry Johnson is definitely going to the pros oh yeah for sure yeah and uh there s some more that i don t i can t think of their names God my girlfriend she she gets me because i can describe them go you know that guy you know and she ll name them for me George Akals and Stacy Augmon yeah now they ll come out in the pros Anderson Hunt they ll come out uh huh they re half they re team is going to be gone now and see that s another thing for next year with UNLV they re not going to have no team uh well i wouldn t say that i i think well i mean as far as the the top players you know like the ones they have this year you know yeah their coach may not be there i think Jerry Tarkenyon may be headed for the pros yeah he s nice there s some talk that he may be uh coaching for the LA Clippers next year uh the Clippers that s another team and i don t think they ve ever done anything they have a great amount of talent but they just have poor coaching i think but um no coaching yeah that s all right they ve got some great players on that team that be all right between them and i just think that yeah then there s that uh let s see i like the Lakers Milwaukee Atlanta Hawks i like them too uh huh i like probably uh the Houston Rockets shocked me the the i think it was last year when they uh last last year they beat LA last year uh huh well Houston s playing really well lately yeah last couple of weeks anyway since Akeem because i know my sister s in LA see and she calls me up and tells me well LA s going to come down there and beat up on Texas you know and i said yeah and so when they came down so what happened it took them a long time they beat them uh huh but it was like four out of the three seven games they had to play the seven games for the for the thing you know just to beat them so it was like one game over sure i think Houston s playing really good ball lately uh huh ever since Akeem changed his uh first name to Hakeem he added the H to the front his attitude i don t know i don t know them people well uh i can understand that it s uh i don t know why he dropped it in the first place but uh i don t either if it was his name he should have just kept it i you know that s your name that s your name sure so who do you think s going to win the NBA this year hopefully i don t think the Lakers are going to win but i think um oh what s his Portland Portland s looking awfully good no not Portland what s that team with the little guy with uh the no Isiah Isiah Thomas Detroit yeah Detroit Pistons they re not as good as they were last year i don t know i think they ll go i think they ll they re good but they re not great but i think they ll they ll have to pick it up in the in the tournament then but i think that s what usually happens to them Chicago s playing really good ball with Michael Jordan um hum and i think they finally put things together yeah they did good last night last night they had like a hundred and something to eighty so they they was playing real good last night yeah well Chicago they they ve been struggling last couple of years and they ve had a good team for the past few years ever since they had Michael Jordan but they never did seem to make an impact on the play offs yeah i think this year they re going to really uh show some talent i think also because they done took some of the pressure off of him oh yeah you know they because they always think it s all him and see there s not you know it s not true they have a good supporting cast that s not good but i mean everybody s always looking at him that s just like Larry Bird and um uh God Larry Bird what team does he play for Celtics Boston Celtics right yeah see because they put a lot on Larry Bird um hum yeah i don t think the Celtics quite have the overall talent that it takes to win the NBA this year hum um they ve got good individual players but some are getting old Robert Parish is thirty seven years old yep he s still playing center and uh Larry Bird s talking about retirement here i guess in another year well he s out i mean he s hurt this year yeah so you know you never know but they re bringing in some good young players too yeah which is good um hum i m i ve always favored Milwaukee being from that area and they ve made some good moves in personnel but i don t see them as having the the type of talent that will win the NBA this year yeah they have to get by Detroit and Chicago i think either one of them is a real tough challenge for them yep if they get by Detroit i think they can get by by uh Atlanta but yeah i don t think Atlanta would be much as much a problem as Chicago well that s what i meant yeah they get by Chicago hey can get by Atlanta uh huh it would it if you can beat Chicago Atlanta shouldn t be that much different right you just slow down Isiah Thomas and Atlanta is um they got what
