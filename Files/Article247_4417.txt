 All About Bacon Tim Allow me to share a portion of a missive that came my way today from our editor Let us in on the process of how you mine the news for subjects what strikes you as funny how MAD chooses its targets etc We d also love to hear your reviews of the newspapers attempts to be funny from political cartoons to columns from the likes of Maureen D Molly Ivins Dave Barry etc As long as it doesn t involve me having to dance in public I will do just about anything to please a fellow editor so here goes Like anyone who has the good fortune to have a job where they get to spoof current events I do my best to stay well current That is I read a lot of magazines pore over a couple of newspapers every day and watch a good deal of television particularly Ready Set Cook on the TV Food Network which admittedly doesn t help me stay abreast of world affairs but I now know how to make a hell of a coq au vin The secret Capers Anyway from there the subjects pretty much suggest themselves and it s just a matter of coming up with the right hook and good lines For that I rely on Pico the Comedy Elf I type up the subjects I want to spoof and put them under my pillow In the morning Poof The jokes are there I can t speak for the other MAD editors writers artists I think they rely on talent or something As for the aforementioned newspaper columnists well I have to admit that with the exception of Maureen Dowd who I m not sure is a humor writer in the strictest sense although she can be savagely funny I don t really read the newspaper humor folks on a regular basis Again this is mostly because I m spending my free time watching the TV Food Network Have you seen Taste with David Rosengarten I believe he s the editor of Gourmet which is a pretty upscale magazine and he comes on and you think he s going to be the biggest stuffed shirt in the world and he proceeds to do a half hour show on bacon Just bacon Unfortunately I missed the last few minutes and never found out what kind of wine best accompanies bacon Wait I also read John Ficarra s frequent Op Ed pieces in the New York Daily News And not just because he s my boss at MAD Anyway I ve relied on you in the past to introduce me to new writers Joe Queenan comes to mind so let me ask you Which newspaper columnists if any do you find funny And before you answer remember that technically The Lockhorns doesn t count as a columnist
