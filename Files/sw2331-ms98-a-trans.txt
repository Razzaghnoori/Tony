 are you a player uh i like to think i am it s it s been a while now is it yeah i ve uh oh just recently i got married and we bought a house we re about fifty yards from the golf course but unfortunately the house is taking up my time um yeah so it s been uh it s been almost a year i guess since i ve actually uh swung a club for a purpose yeah i haven t i haven t played in about two years and then i went out two weeks ago with the guys here i work at TI and i played in a tournament out there and i shot a net fifty nine they were kind of little upset yeah but i guess i laid off long enough to get rid of all my bad habits yeah yeah i have a hard time inventing shots you know let s go around this tree and you know try a slice through a hook here and i can t do that so i i finally got out and i ve been watching quite a few videos i right right hadn t been able to play so i took out a few videos and watched them for a while and i i hope i m on the right track you know i shot a career low eighty nine so and my handicap s twenty i yeah that s that s great yeah i like the no it s uh i could say it s been a while for me too i uh i ve got my wife motivated about it um really and uh i think that s probably going to be one of our next investments is get her get her a set of clubs and uh we ll get out of the driving range and and get some interest built up and hopefully we can uh we can start in yeah i ve tried to get my wife i bought her a set of clubs four years ago she hasn t even swung them but she wants to get into it now after i came home and won the tournament the other day she s really well great great that s good she s ready to get off into it but you know i like i just like getting out being in the outdoors and i m a hunter and a fisher anyway but you know i i you know at least i can get out and play a few hours of golf and yeah same thing here it s not going to cost me an arm and a leg really right right and i you know i walk i don t ride so you know i get a little exercise there too so um hum yeah that s i ve got the same attitude i uh i tell you i i started i guess the first time i played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago now when i was in college yeah and uh i took uh took it as a PE course and then kind of left it alone for a while and then finally got got into it when i was while i was still in school right since then uh we ve made it um as as the friends start getting married and things like that we ve made a tradition of uh having a a Thursday or well have have probably like a like a Thursday night bachelor party and a Friday golf day before the wedding yeah and uh so it that s back in South Dakota where i grew up and uh so that that s uh that s been my main my main involvement is it seems like i go home and play golf more than i do around here but uh oh yeah eventually i get people to come and visit me in Dallas and then i ll show them that we can play golf in the middle of winter when we can t do it back home yeah it s pretty nice we played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not they were amazed yeah you know here it is sixty five degrees we re out playing golf and they re freezing cold back there so yep yep but i uh i i picked it up when i was in high school at on the same as a PE course and then when i got into the service i got into it oh okay and then when i come out here i just kind of let it go and then one of one of the guys mentioned to me at work one day if i played golf i said well yeah you know i ve got my clubs but i haven t swung them in quite a few years yeah and then i got into it and then back out of it and it it just seems like every couple of years i get back in there yeah that s right you know i really enjoy it it s really nice oh it is it s it s a lot of fun especially especially if you can find somebody that s uh that s got the same level of interest that that seems to be the hardest thing well about that s that s that s true of any sport you know if you want to play tennis or yeah yeah you don t want to go out and get beat to death but racquetball right and and people don t want to play with somebody that they re going to beat every time you know and and uh and no and then you know we ve got some guys here they re you know four and five handicappers and they don t like to play with me because i m too slow for them so um hum right you know but get somebody around your own handicap and you can just mosey on out for three or four hours and have a good time that s right yeah and i ve you know i ve never yet never yet have i walked up now i ve walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with and never yet have i met anybody on the golf course that wouldn t allow me to join their twosome or threesome you know they re always friendly sure come on out you know and they don t mind if you make a mistake they don t mind saying well you know let me teach tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that or that s true that s true well you know it s it s pretty nice and friendly out there and you can t find that in all sports that that that s uh yeah that s absolutely right and you can gain a lot of ground doing that too if you right you you know you you get stuck you get in a rut if if you do play a lot but you play with the same people you you aren t going to learn anything uh after after a short period once you learn everything they ve got to offer then uh yeah yeah you need to you know you ve basically tapped your resources there yeah but uh i d i d like to uh eventually i d like to work work up if if my wife does get interested and and maybe get involved in a league in a in a mixed mixed doubles league or something like that oh yeah we we have one down here in the summertime uh it runs from like five o clock to seven thirty or eight o clock you know because it doesn t get dark until nine thirty or ten um hum right and we play in the summertime out here we get a mixed league in and that s what i m trying to get her ready for it s going to start well when we change the time back whenever that is next month i guess uh huh and it ll start then and you know we had a lot of girls out there a couple of years ago and they were just starting to learn and you know they were shooting a hundred a hundred and twenty but they were sure you know now they re down into the hundreds nineties nineties nineties so it won t take her long right well that s good that s good that sounds like a lot of fun you know and it s something we can do together so well she doesn t do much hunting she could care less about that she does a little fishing but you know golf would give her the exercise she d be outside give her something to do that we both enjoy so yeah yeah it it sounds like we ve got real similar situations uh i i go home uh i ve gone home every year now since i ve moved to Dallas to to go pheasant hunting and uh yeah um hum um the the last time i i took my wife along and uh kind kind of the same situation she sat she sat in the house and talked to my mother the whole time we were out hunting and stuff but yeah she ll definitely uh she ll make the trip for fishing if we if that comes along but uh yeah all right it s uh that s interesting though yeah and it s you know it s a game that you don t like bowling you know you feel bad if you bowl a hundred but if you shoot a hundred in golf you know you don t have to be an expert to play any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold one and learn how to do it and do it right um hum that s right um hum so you know you don t have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all that s right well yeah that s i ve i ve kind of formed the attitude that you know if if i could just if i could pick two or three shots out uh out of my game every time and put them together on one hole then i do pretty good and then and yeah i keep i keep rationalizing that well you know i i can do it i i just got to do it all at the on the same hole and and then it ll get better and you just keep going and in the meantime just enjoy what you re doing and yeah it it it really works that way and when you know when i first got back into it i used to get mad because i knew i could do something and i didn t get it done you know and i just well i need to slice this ball around here i naturally slice anyway um hum now you know the ball ll go straight and i go i never broke a club or anything but you know i d get upset about it sometimes and now i guess you know being in my forties i just kind of mellowed out a little bit i don t get upset any more so yeah yeah sure sure and yeah that s great well i enjoyed talking to you well you bet i guess i ll go back to work okay sounds like it all right see you later bud bye bye okay bye
