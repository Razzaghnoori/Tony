                    Background        Repetitive sequences present many difficulties for        genome sequencing and analysis The presence of large        numbers of repeats often confounds sequence assembly        especially if the repeats are long and highly conserved        The presence of low copynumber repeats can also confound        assembly especially for wholegenome shotgun sequencing        projects   Once a genome has been assembled repeats        take on a new and more important role involving their        biological function Certain classes of repeats such as        transposons perform a function by allowing mobile elements        to move around a genome Other classes belong to less        welldefined categories with respect to their role though        they may be even more ubiquitous Repetitive sequences        appear to dominate the centromeres of many eukaryotes          and telomeric and subtelomeric repeats extend for thousands        or tens of thousands of nucleotides at the ends of        chromosomes These repeats also appear elsewhere in the        genome for reasons as yet unknown For these and other        reasons it is critical to both the assembly and analysis        of genomic sequences to identify and characterize        repetitive sequence elements        There are numerous computational methods for detecting        repeats in one form or another in genomic DNA sequences        These include algorithms that locate repeated substrings        including tandem repeats      as well as programs        for identifying known repeats such as the widelyused        RepeatMasker   RepeatMasker uses a database of known        repeat sequences and implements a stringmatching algorithm        to find copies of those repeats in a new sequence A more        rapid implementation of the same approach is MaskerAid          a wrapper for WUBLAST    that uses the BLAST        engine instead of the CrossMatch algorithm Most of these        tools have some restriction on the maximum length of the        input sequence which limits their use to sequences        considerably smaller than the size of a eukaryotic        chromosome Recently however new systems based on suffix        trees such as RepeatMatch based on MUMmer   and        REPuter    have overcome this size limitation at        least for biologically realistic input sizes Both        RepeatMatch and REPuter are highly efficient computational        tools that can find all exact repeats in sequences as long        as complete eukaryotic chromosomes   megabases Mb        The output of these systems however while accurately        representing the long list of positions of exact repeats        does not provide any overview or summary of the repetitive        structure of the sequence The REPuter system includes a        visualization tool to generate repeat graphs which are        useful for identifying the positions of repeats but this        does not provide an overview of the exact and nonexact        repeats in a genome Figure shows an example of a repeat        graph   for a short DNA sequence        Examining the output of REPuter and RepeatMatch for a        complete bacterial genome it quickly becomes obvious that        many exact repeats are nonexact copies of one another        Whether a genome is a few or hundreds of megabases in        length the task of recognizing and describing how repeats        resemble one another at this scale is too complicated to        accomplish manually        Here we describe a new system for the recognition of        repeat classes in genome sequences This system        RepeatFinder is freely available from our website          In contrast to approaches that cluster together the results        of BLAST searches for example ZH Bao and S Eddy        unpublished data our algorithm uses a comprehensive set of        exact repeats as the basis for constructing repeat classes        It relies on the efficient suffix tree data structure for        identification of exact repeats which permits rapid        identification of repeat classes even in sequences        containing tens of millions of nucleotides The algorithm        does not make any prior assumptions about the number or        structure of the classes At its core is a merging        procedure that produces the actual members of each repeat        class using merging criteria described below and it also        builds a repeat map of the genome sequence        We have applied this system to several complete        microbial genomes         to the        complete         Arabidopsis thaliana genome   and        to a large collection of rice bacterial artificial        chromosome BAC end sequences    The results of        this analysis are described below The output of the system        gives a clear picture of all repeat classes identified in a        genome or a sequence collection It provides        straightforward access to the actual repeat sequences as a        multifasta file simple statistical analyses of the        results and a procedure for identifying each classs most        representative element We describe here the computational        techniques used in the system and demonstrate its use on        several different genome sequences                    Results and discussion                  Algorithm description          Our algorithm is based on first identifying all exact          repeats in the input sequence and then defining repeat          classes by merging and extending these short exact          matches An exact repeat is represented by pair of          coordinates            A                       A             delimiting its location in the          genome sequence and by the repeat length           l We implemented an algorithm that          uses either of two suffix tree methods RepeatMatch            or REPuter   to determine all the exact repeats in a          given sequence For more on suffix trees see   The          computational time and space requirements for both these          systems are linear in the size of the input sequences an          essential requirement for any algorithm attempting to          process whole eukaryotic genomes The subsequent          clustering procedure merges neighboring repeats and          groups them into classes The input to the system can be          either a single genome sequence or a set of sequences          The clustering procedure consists of the following steps          which are described in more detail below          Step  Selection and preprocessing The list of          coordinates of all exact repeats as output by RepeatMatch          or REPuter can be interpreted as a partition of the          original genome sequence The output of RepeatMatch and          REPuter are very similar We used REPuter in the example          and in the subsequent repeat analyses of microbial          genomes for the           A thaliana genome and and the rice          BAC endsequence data we used RepeatMatch Each          partition point has a reference to the pair coordinates                     A                       A             and the repeat length           l Each repeat corresponds to at          least two partition points Some repeats can be found in          the sequence more than twice and the corresponding          partition points can appear with different coordinates          and different lengths To prepare the data for the          merging procedure we sort the list of partition points          in increasing order and in the case of duplicate first          coordinates in increasing order of second coordinates          The clustering algorithm is orderindependent however          the linear nature of repeat data allows us to use this          preprocessing step to simplify the clustering procedure          without affecting the final clusters In particular          cases it is useful to filter the original repeat data to          remove certain types of repeats for example simple          onebase homopolymeric or twobase repeats          Step  Merging procedure In outline this procedure          works by repeatedly merging together two exact repeats          that either overlap or that occur within a limited          distance a gap of each other Specific values for the          overlap and gap distance can be specified for each genome          sequence Whether the algorithm is merging repeats that          overlap Figure c or merging repeats separated by a          gap Figure b the new merging repeats will always have          the property that significant subsequences of the repeat          appear at least twice in the genome sequence          At the time of merging procedure we generate a repeat          map of the genome sequence This map is based on a          linkedlist data structure which allows for rapid and          simple modifications to the dynamically changing repeat          data Every merging repeat in the map is linked by          pointers to all the merging repeats with which it shares          exact repeats          Step  Classification This step defines the repeat          classes Each merging repeat will be assigned to a          specific class if its list of references that is the          repeats that were combined into the merging repeat          contains at least one repeat that already belongs to the          class If a merging repeat has references that belong to          multiple distinct classes then those classes are          combined into one If a merging repeat contains no          references to an existing class then the merging repeat          forms a new class          Step  BLAST searches and repeat class updates The          initial classification is based on exact repeats To          merge together similar but nonexact repeats we use          WUBLAST    to search all merging repeats against          all others The resulting matches between the classes are          used as input to an update procedure which redistributes          all merging repeats into new classes It is possible to          skip this step if the initial repeat set contains          approximate rather than exact repeats                          Step  Preprocessing          In this step the output from REPuter or RepeatMatch          is used to partition the original genome sequence For          each repeat starting at coordinates           A            and           A            with length           l  this list will include both            A                       A                       l  and            A                       A                       l  The list is then sorted by          first and by second coordinates To illustrate the          method we use the example shown in Figure  The table          on the left in Figure shows all seven pairs of repeats          while the right table shows the corresponding sorted          partition points                          Step  Merging and repeat map generation          Using the list of partition points we begin merging          exact repeats using the following criteria Given two          partition points           p                        A                       A                       l                       A             and           p                        B                       B                       l                       B             where           A                       B             we compute the distance between          the nonoverlapping repeats as                    d            p                       p              max            B                       A                       l                       A                       Next given a maximum gap size           G   the merging with gap          protocol uses the rule that sequences corresponding to           p            and           p            are merged if                    d            p                       p                        G           The merging with overlap protocol only merges          sequences that overlap one another that is they are at          least partially identical We denote the overlap of two          sequences as                     p                       p              max            A                       l                       A                       B              for           A                       B                      Then the criterion for merging with overlap is as          follows given a minimum overlap proportion           op where             op   repeat points            A                       A                       l                       A             and            B                       B                       l                       B             are merged if at least one of the four repeats has          overlap satisfying                      p                       p                        op min            l                       A                       l                       B                      The parameter           op is interpreted as a fraction of          the shorter of the two repeats Thus for           op   we will merge two          overlapped sequences if the length of their overlap is at          least  of the length of the shorter sequence          Using either merging procedure if two sequences are          merged then the new sequence will be defined as a merging          repeat with starting position           M            A            and with length           l                       M             max            A                       l                       A                       B                       l                       B                        A             The merging procedure is not          permitted to merge pairs of partition points of the form                     B                       B                       l                       B             and            B                       B                       l                       B             This condition avoids merging of tandem repeats          and avoids repetitiveness within the merging repeats          On the left side of Figure we illustrate the merging          procedure using a merging with           G   Dark gray rectangles mark          the start coordinates of merging repeats The extent of          each merging repeat is shown by dividing sets of repeats          using horizontal lines          This procedure by updating and creating new          references leads to the repeat map shown on the right of          Figure  These references define the correspondences          between all merging repeats Each merging repeat          maintains references to the other merging repeats with          which it shares exact repeats each exact repeat is          assigned to the first merging repeat in which it appears          In our example the merging repeat starting in coordinate           gets a reference to itself only because its exact          repeats have no previous references The next repeat          starting in position  gets a reference to itself and          to its mate the merging repeat  A data structure          stores with each merging repeat its start coordinate its          length            l                       M             the number of exact repeats it includes            n                       M             and a list of references to itself and to other          repeats            R                       R                       R                                      Step  Classification          Given the repeat map we can begin to define classes          by noting that if a merging repeat has at least one          reference in common with another then they belong to the          same class Figure illustrates one step in this          procedure The merging repeat            M l                       M              has two common references in two different          classes class  and class  These classes are then          combined together into a new class  which contains all          references from both the original classes                          Step  BLAST searches and further merging          For this step the most timeconsuming part of the          algorithm we use the underlying sequences of the merging          repeats and run a BLAST search of all sequences against          all others Classes are merged if any of their underlying          sequences have a BLAST           E value less then a userspecified          threshold when compared to any sequence in another class          If a class appears in multiple similarity pairs all          these similar classes are merged with the original class          For the example in Figure  BLAST searches do not reveal          any new similarity pairs thus the classification from          the figure is identical to the final classification          Table                           Repeat analysis of microbial genomes          We used our repeat clustering algorithm to analyze          several complete microbial genomes Table summarizes the          repeat analysis for the           Neisseria meningitidis genome            using two different clustering criteria It illustrates          how increasing the exact repeat size in the initial step          leads to fewer merging repeats and fewer classes It also          shows how reducing the size of the gap and increasing the          required overlap increases the number of repeat classes          as would be expected          For a more comprehensive repeat analysis we chose          seven different microbial genomes using  base pairs          bp as the minimal exact repeat length and allowing less          than a  bp gap for the merging procedure Table shows          the results for these genomes It presents the number of          merging repeats the number of repeat classes the          longest single merging repeat and the number of classes          containing more than two members As shown here these          latter classes comprise only  of all repeat          classes indicating that most repeat types are simple          duplications Among these duplication the vast majority          occur in tandem although this is not shown in Table           The picture given here shows how repeat analysis can          quickly provide an overall picture of how repetitive a          genome is in addition the analysis extracts the repeats          themselves for further analysis                          Defining the prototype for a repeat class          Small microbial genomes have relatively few types of          repeats and relatively few copies of each type In          contrast our studies of longer eukaryotic genome          sequences have uncovered tens of thousands of repeat          classes and hundreds of thousands of merging repeats In          order to be able to process this data efficiently  in          particular in order to run the procedure where all          classes are compared against each other using BLAST  we          developed a procedure to define the most representative          element for each class which we call its prototype          Referring to the repeat map shown in Figure  we use          the length of the merging repeat            l                       M             and the number of exact repeats            n                       M             to defined the desirable properties for the          prototype The different merging protocols affect the          properties of the prototype Thus in the merging with          gap procedure the merging repeats with the longest          lengths and with the greatest number of subrepeats should          be the best candidates to represent the class In this          case many members will consist of simple subsequences of          the prototype When we use the merging with overlap          procedure we also look for the greatest number of          subrepeats but the length of the most representative          repeat should be closer to the shortest repeat in the          class In this case the representative element will tend          to match across most of its length to every member of the          class          Using these considerations we can construct the          objective function for both cases For each class given          the merging repeat length           l            l                       M             and number of subrepeats           n            n                       M             the maximum and the minimum repeat lengths in the          class            l           max and           l           min  and the maximum and the minimum          number of subrepeats in the class            n           max and           n           min  we define the function           Fln for each merging repeat of          the class as          for merging with gaps and          for merging with overlaps          This nonnegative function is a summary of the          variance in the length and number of subrepeats from the          desirable values for the class prototype Then we solve          the optimization problem of minimizing function           Fln           find            l            n  corresponding to an element in          the single repeat class min           Fln           If we get several elements that minimize this          function we select the one with the maximal number of          subrepeats Thus in our example Figures     the          prototype for class  is the longest repeat starting in          position  with           l   and           n   Likewise the prototype for          class  is the repeat starting at position  and for          class  it is the repeat starting at position  We used          this procedure in our studies of the genome sequences of           A thaliana   and rice BAC end          sequences                             Repeat structure of the Arabidopsisgenome          The  Mb           A thaliana genome consists of five          chromosomes ranging from  Mb to  Mb in length We          applied the suffix tree algorithm for finding exact          repeats to each of these sequences separately and than          used our clustering method to determine the repetitive          structure of each chromosome We found from  to           pairs of exact repeats in each chromosome using a          minimum length of  bp after filtering out simple          repeat sequences These repeats in total represent          approximately  of the chromosome sequences To group          the repeats into classes the gap merging strategy was          used with a maximum gap size of less than  bp The          algorithm finds some  repeat classes per          chromosome but only  of these contain more than two          elements           Arabidopsis is known to contain          extensive gene duplication and strong evidence of a          wholegenome duplication   thus it is not surprising          to observe such a preponderance of repeats with just two          members We defined the prototype element for each class          using the optimization procedure described above          combined all the prototypes from five chromosomes in one          database and generated a final classification of the          whole genome by clustering the BLAST search results of          all prototypes against all This resulted in over           classes with three or more elements Table contains a          summary of the repeat structure for the entire           A thaliana genome          To find out more about the composition of the           Arabidopsis repeats each sequence          was searched against AtRepBase   and the           Arabidopsis gene database            using a maximum BLAST Evalue of  and at least           identity for           Arabidopsis genes and at least           identity to AtRepBase sequences Of  repeat          sequences that fall into  separate repeat classes           sequences matched an annotated repeat sequence in          AtRepBase and  sequences matched a segment of an           Arabidopsis gene Comparing both          sets of matches only  of the repeat sequences were          found to match both a gene segment and an annotated          repeat sequence The large number of repeats that match          gene segments reflects the prevalence of segmental          chromosomal duplications and tandem gene duplications in           Arabidopsis Due to the greedy          merging with gap method used to build the repeat          classes relatively few of the repeat classes contained          an abundance of the repeat sequences the largest repeat          class contained  sequences of which  matched          gene segments and  matched annotated repeats          To further analyze the composition of the repeat          classes a prototype repeat sequence was chosen to          represent each repeat class containing at least five          members and the top database matches were identified          Table  Of the  prototype repeat sequences          examined approximately half  matched gene segments          and  matched annotated repeats The genes matched by          the prototype repeat sequences include known members of          large           Arabidopsis gene families including          a cytochrome P a receptor kinase a          diseaseresistance protein and several transposon open          reading frames In addition there were many matches to          hypothetical proteins the validity of which remains to          be determined The biological relevance of the remaining          repeat classes remains unclear at present                          Rice repeat database          Yuan           et al   recently reported on          the construction of a rice repeat database that was          generated by searching all available rice sequences for          minisatellite sequences mobile elements rDNA          centromeric repeat sequences and telomeric repeat          sequences This database includes  sequences We          attempted to use the repeat finding system described here          to enlarge this set using as input the large collection          of sequences from the Clemson University rice BAC end          database            Unlike either           Arabidopsis or the microbial          genomes where a single genome sequence or a few large          chromosomes were being processed in this case we had           BAC end sequences with an average length of          approximately  bp We therefore developed a          special preprocessing procedure which generates a single          sequence approximately  Mb long from all the BAC          ends Each original sequence is represented by its          coordinate in the new sequence This procedure permits          the algorithm to work with hundreds of thousands of          different sequences simultaneously The system found           exact repeat pairs with lengths from  bp to           bp where the latter represents an entire BAC end          that was repeated exactly The maximum length of each          repeat was bounded by the length of the BAC end sequence          in which it was found This length restriction was added          to the merging procedure to avoid artificially long          repeats that might mistakenly span more than one BAC end          sequence The preclustering procedure also includes          filtering of the exact repeats data to remove          simplesequence repeats which were determined to          comprise over  of exact repeats We merged the          filtered exact repeats data requiring an overlap of           This resulted in  repeat classes of which only           include more than two elements Table contains a          summary of these repeat classes A searchable rice repeat          database based on the prototypes of these classes is          available online at            To test this new repeat database we compared it to          the set of annotated repeats based on known expertly          curated repeats   There were four general groups in          this set telomerecentromere repeats          transposontransposonlike repeats rDNA and all the          rest   We used BLAST to search annotated repeats          against the rice repeat database using an Evalue cutoff          of   Classification of the BLAST hits shows that the          annotated repeats from the four distinct groups always          fall into separate classes in the rice repeat database          in other words the new database divides the previous          repeat classes into a finergrained set of repeats but          it does not merge any of the four known groups          together                          Performance          Because of the use of the efficient suffix tree          procedures the system runs very fast with the          allversusall BLAST search consuming approximately           of the computation time The running time of the exact          repeat finder is about  of the total with the          other processes  merging clustering and postBLAST          updating  using a relatively minor proportion of overall          computation time The running time depends on both the          sequence length and the number of repeats for example          small microbial genomes take just  minutes whereas          the highly repetitive rice repeat database took about two          days to process The memory needed for computation is          dominated by the requirements of the suffix tree used for          the initial repeats computation     this can          grow to many gigabytes for large eukaryotic          chromosomes                            Conclusions        We describe a new system for rapid identification of all        repeats in genome sequences and assignment of these repeats        to similarity classes The system has been used to analyze        the repeat structure of several complete microbial genomes        and the much larger genome of the model plant         A thaliana We also used it to        create a new rice repeat database based on an analysis of        a large BAC end sequence database This new computational        tool should prove helpful in the analysis of repeat        structure for both complete and partial genome        sequences
