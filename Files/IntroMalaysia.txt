 The Country and ITS People As Malaysia has moved resolutely into the modern age it has also remained culturally and historically a rich multi layered blend of traditions wrapped up within a modern busy economy From sandy beaches broad brown rivers and deep forests to rising skyscrapers and wide expressways Malaysia is set to exceed visitors expectations Visitors see the traditional juxtaposed with the modern among Chinatown shophouses among the vibrancy and aromas of popular night markets and even in the modern shopping centers They see architectural splendor among the many mosques the incense rich Chinese and Hindu shrines and even the Petronas Twin Towers of Kuala Lumpur History can be lived and felt amid the longhouses of Sabah and Sawarak in the kite flying and top spinning traditions of northeastern Kelantan in the many graceful and beautiful dance and story telling traditions and in the vibrant colors of batik art Your gateway to Malaysia will probably be through its capital Kuala Lumpur a modern city of broad expressways skyscrapers and green parks to balance the urban sprawl Prosperous and colorful it is well prepared to take the country into the next millennium Malaysia is divided into two major regions the peninsula bordered by Thailand the Straits of Melaka and the South China Sea and East Malaysia whose two provinces Sabah and Sawarak are located on the island of Borneo about 800 km 500 miles across the South China Sea These latter vast regions of forests rivers and mountains border the Indonesian state of Kalimantan and the oil rich sultanate of Brunei Industry and urban society are concentrated on the peninsula especially on the West coast while East Malaysia is dominated by the country s characteristic impenetrable jungle Malaysia s two parts share a hot humid climate but differ greatly in population density and urban development Malaysia s relative wealth is reflected in the excellent network of roads and a good railway system along the peninsula s west coast Its per capita income is one of the highest in Southeast Asia bettered only by that of neighboring Singapore Some 40 percent of Malaysians live in townships of more than 5 000 inhabitants an exceptional proportion for the region Its mortality rate for children under five of 13 per 1 000 places it on a par with major industrial countries Nature s Supremacy Whether you are staying at beach resorts or visiting the cities you will always find the jungle ready to reassert its rights Water is also a constant presence sometimes as waves lapping on white sandy beaches or as beautiful cascading waterfalls or as majestic wide rivers running snake like across the land forcing apart forest cover before reaching the sea Even in Kuala Lumpur as modern an urban sprawl as you could imagine criss crossed by expressways and bristling with skyscrapers a construction site abandoned a moment too long to the tropical sun and rain will soon sprout a luxuriant growth of lallang ferns and wild creepers Over the centuries the country s prosperity has come from its coastal plains wider on the west than the east side of the peninsula Malaysia rose first as a trading point for Asia and Europe with the ports of Melaka Malacca in colonial times and later Singapore now sovereign and independent Then came tin mining and rubber plantations and more recently palm oil hardwood timber and offshore petroleum and gas Rice paddies in the northwest towards the Thai border and around river deltas on the east coast serve only domestic consumption Mangrove swamps along the coast and squat nipa palms give rise to mangrove jungle The world s oldest rainforests engulf low but steeply rising mountain chains that cross the peninsula from east to west like ribs with one long north south Main Range as their backbone Until the highway construction in the modern era access to the jungle interior had been and in some cases still is only by river The river beds are mostly too shallow for anything but flat bottomed boats On the great island of Borneo East Malaysia s states of Sarawak and Sabah surround the enclave of the oil rich sultanate of Brunei Plantations alternate with marshland on the coastal plain before giving way to the all powerful jungle of the interior Navigation is hindered by sandbars at the mouth and rapids upriver though small sea going vessels can make fair headway up the Rejang in Sarawak and up the Kinabatangan in Sabah To the south a natural barrier of mountain ranges comprises the border with Indonesian Kalimantan Near the coast at the northern end of the Crocker Range is Mount Kinabalu at 4 100 m 13 450 ft the highest peak in Southeast Asia and a favorite with climbers both professional and amateur With the growth of tourism as a major industry resort facilities have burgeoned in smaller islands such as Penang Pangkor and Langkawi on the west coast of the peninsula Tioman on the east coast and around Sabah s offshore nature reserve near Kota Kinabalu Top of a Quiet World In an era of seemingly perpetual ethnic hostilities Malaysia can be proud of a unique achievement the coexistence of the three most prominent peoples of Asia Malays mostly Muslim Chinese mostly Buddhist and Indians many Hindu Despite occasional conflicts they live in a remarkable state of harmony It is not unusual to find as in old Melaka Buddhist and Hindu temples on the same street as a mosque Not least of all it makes for a marvellous diversity in the national cuisines with food centers often serving Malay Chinese and Indian dishes at adjacent stalls see page 160 With Islam as the national religion and Malay Bahasa Malaysia as the national language Malays enjoy practically exclusive access to the principal positions of government at federal and state level They share a common ancestry with inhabitants of the Indonesian archipelago At the upper end of the social scale Malays make up the royal courts of the sultanates country gentry enjoying an occasional game of polo and the other good things in life Farther down urban Malays form a modern bourgeoisie cultivating contacts with the Arab Middle East and keeping only a remote eye on their country estates The more prosperous send their children to British and other overseas schools The bulk of Malays in the country at large are humbler town and village dwelling people tending goats and buffaloes growing rice and working in the coconut rubber timber rattan and bamboo industries Just as court ritual is still colored by the ancient customs of pre Muslim Malaya so a mild mannered Sunnite version of the Muslim religion is often seasoned amid this all pervasive nature with a generous spoonful of the more ancient beliefs of animist medicine men Economic development has given younger Malaysians wider choices than in previous generations Access to these choices will prove a necessity as the younger generation of business and community leaders prepare to lead the country into the 21st century The Malays have a perfect understanding of their tropical climate They know how important it is to keep cool and calm and move around slowly Their relaxed attitude and their constant smiles are delightfully infectious to the newcomer who soon learns to shrug off the stresses of modern life
