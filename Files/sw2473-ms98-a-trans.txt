 so uh Deanna where do you like to fish well we usually go fishing at Toledo Bend um hum and um my parents they re the fishermen and my brother uh i i usually don t do too much fishing i usually take my raft and float along behind the boat and get a suntan um hum oh great great but they love to crappie fish my brother likes to bass fish so um uh huh what what do you what do you use for bait for crappie and bass for crappie they use shiners um hum and um bass my brother usually puts a jig or something like that on there for it or a top water bait you know sometimes usually artificial bait for bass um hum um hum and then um we sometimes get crickets and they they fish for bream and i ve never used crickets before do you use them live yeah you haven t what you put put the hooks through their little back and they just jump around under the water um hum and and and and what are crickets good for bream brim um hum um hum uh huh and um also they have these uh wasp the the um larvae is that what it s called wasp wasp larvae um hum oh yeah yeah and uh oh anytime we can find those my parents just scoop up on those because they are so good for fishing um hum um hum and um they use those a lot but usually it s either shiners or oh just a minute i got to see who that is okay so anyway uh uh do you ever fish for catfish no we usually don t do i mean they catch catfish i keep saying they because i never fish but um they catch catfish you on accident sometimes oh okay and then whenever we do trot lines and stuff they usually get catfish are they are they big ones um uh usually not too big probably maybe two or three pounds you know i ve seen some huge catfish um hum yeah yeah i think you have to go deep for those don t you though don t they kind of just kind of scavenge along the bottom of of wherever they are the bottom yeah um hum yeah uh what what kind of a boat do y all have well we used to just have a little aluminum boat but uh my dad has sold it so he s hunting a boat now i think he s looking into Bass Tracker um hum um hum he found him one last weekend that he really liked but we haven t gotten it yet so oh yeah yeah well we don t have a boat we usually fish off the shore or off the dock and my i ve got a son that s a senior in high school and he just loves he loves fishing i i don t have the patience that he does well oh i agree uh you know it s it s sitting there on the dock and you go a hour and nothing s happened he says no dad i know they re down there let s not go i know they re down there and they re and they re gonna bite anytime and uh that s right we re talking about fishing today daddy uh uh he got into a place where uh we were in there where there was a bunch of sand bass schooling and my goodness oh he was throwing this was one day last summer and he every as often as he could throw that hook out there he d get one but we don t deplete the fish population because we pull them up and look at them admire them and take them off and throw them back although he went somewhere with some friends last week and fished for catfish and got them and i think it s the first time that he s ever that he s actually prepared and ate what they caught he and some friends of his the first time they ve ever done anything but throw them back oh but uh we we you know we we started with just rudimentary things like worms and night crawlers and uh and uh uh gone to uh minnows and can catch just a lot of sandies or even catfish with minnows uh and we take we fish at Lake Texoma oh and and then and then just kind of stop there on the way by and get the uh and and get the and get minnows and uh it s it s pretty lot of fun except i say you got to have a lot of patience because some days it doesn t seem like anything s down there at all yeah and then other other days uh uh you you can pull them in with some degree of regularity it seems as the summer comes when it gets warm and you have calm days without a lot of wind they seem to be uh far more prevalent well i just do not have the patience for it but i mean we usually um keep our fish that are right size you know that are a good eating size because my parents love to eat fish but no yeah oh sure um the little ones we throw back or my dad will bring them home and put them in my fish tank yeah throw throw them back and let them get bigger so you can come get them next year yeah yeah yeah and catch them next time yeah but you know at at Texoma it s such a big lake and we don t have a boat but we re on the dock and people come in there s a lot of sandy islands out in the middle of Texoma uh huh and they go out and fish around there and people come in with these ice chests just full of of you know twelve fourteen sixteen eighteen inch long fish oh great it s the darndest thing i ve ever seen and i don t know we we re probably going to have to get us a boat one of these days soon and go out and see go out and see what s really out there they are so expensive oh yeah i know they are i used to have one that we used to ski ski behind oh i love to ski and and before our our children came along my wife and i used to ski all the time then when the and we kept it on it was an eighteen footer it was kind of big to haul over the road so we kept it at a lake tied up yeah um hum and then when your children are very little you can t go out and do things like that and it got so the insurance and the and the uh and the tie up fee uh was yeah gigantic compared to what use we were getting out of it so i went and sold it and never bought again and it s too bad now that the kids are teenagers they want they d love to get out there and learn to ski and do the boating and fishing again so we ll probably do something like that oh yeah do you do you camp at the lake a lot yeah we um we usually do probably usually in the springtime or in the fall in the summer but not in the summer yeah the summer time s a little too hot oh okay um we usually go pitch a tent and we stay out there for the weekend or um for the week matter of fact i think we re going to go again in in May um hum the middle of May we re uh planning a trip down to Toledo Bend and sometimes we rent a trailer and then oh um hum where where is Toledo Bend um it s between the Texas and Louisiana border oh okay it s uh it s on that s ide it s on the east east side what s what s the nearest big city um daddy what s the nearest big city to Toledo Bend this lake s huge i mean it s huge yeah and i was i is it out like near Tyler or Texarkana or Parish he says its exactly half way between Shreveport and Dallas oh okay exactly half way between Shreveport and Dallas um how how long does it take you to get there from Shreveport it s um it usually takes us we it takes about an hour or an hour and a half for us to get there daddy yeah and then my brother will meet us half way since he works you you know he lives in Dallas he usually meets us half way and oh do you work in Shreveport or go to school or what i go to school i go to LSU oh what are you majoring in communications oh my goodness i have been on the LSU campus once i took a recruiting trip for TI there about uh uh eight or nine years ago oh and i was oh i was ever so impressed with the campus in fact it was a two day trip and between appointments i got a chance to walk around and see it uh huh and uh what a what a fabulous darn school it was i was just really really impressed with it well gosh thanks and and i know it s getting off the subject a little bit but i i do you follow a lot of the sports at LSU yeah i sure do i try to i mean um okay well we re we re we re very strong uh women s women s basketball team fans oh so we we follow your basketball team your your women s basketball team a lot and well great yeah i i also try to follow Tech Louisiana Tech the yeah your oh of course they are one of the best uh they didn t do as well this year but we saw them we went down to Austin last year and saw them beat the Longhorns in the regionals yeah they are oh and and uh man they were i guess they went to the final four last year and and didn t make it through but we were just uh uh just really impressed with them what what year are you in at LSU uh huh i am almost a junior after this semester in May i ll be a junior uh huh and what do you plan on doing when you get out uh i want to be a cruise director oh gee what a deal on like on Love Boat huh yeah kind of i guess hey that s a neat thing um i d like to do that for a few years and then whenever i get settled down i would like to go back and teach college i d like to be a professor uh huh are you you then plan on maybe getting an advanced degree somewhere yeah i m gonna um go ahead and go straight in and get my Master s degree oh at LSU you gonna stay there no i m gonna go to uh i m gonna send check into the University of Colorado oh because they have a um special program a Master s one year s Master s program where i can get my Master s in one year um hum so um what would it take about thirty hours or something like that thirty two thirty six i think it s thirty six yeah okay so that would be two long semesters and a summer maybe huh um hum it i mean it s going to take a lot of hard work but um you need yeah okay oh sure sure well i think i think uh uh the best thing to do is i i got two Masters degrees but they both came years after my Bachelor s degree uh huh and if i had it to do all over again i would do what you re planning to do like continue um hum you need to get it while you re still hot that s what everybody has said because once you get out and make that money it s so hard to get back into it it it is it is very hard to go back and and actually the academic part isn t bad when your when you resume because it seems that things come easier because you re more mature and you ve got all your life experiences and i thought the academic part would be harder but it really isn t uh because uh it because uh uh i don t know i think the maturity factor uh uh overcomes the fact that you ve had a gap yeah but nevertheless it s it s so much it s so hard to get back to it and it s it s so much easier while you ve got your academic juices flowing well what were what are your degrees in i have uh my first one s in my Bachelor s in Chemistry and my Master s in Physics and in uh in Management uh uh uh quality management i ve been in i ve been in quality management with TI and engineering management and and uh oh goodness
