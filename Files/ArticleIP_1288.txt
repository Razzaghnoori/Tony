 Movies Men in Black Columbia Pictures Barry Get Shorty Sonnenfeld s shamelessly silly comedy about government agents who police extraterrestrials is hailed as the most offbeat and enjoyable blockbuster of the summer S uccessful absurdist fiction says New York s David Denby Like other blockbusters it may suffer from a perilously thin plot Anthony Lane The New Yorker but that s the least important thing about the movie Newsweek Instead reviewers revel in its deadpan humor stylish costumes and comic performances particularly that of Tommy Lee Jones registering levels of cool that would cause most actors to snap in half Lane Stills and clips are available here Books Women With Men by Richard Ford Knopf Having celebrated his 1995 novel Independence Day which won a Pulitzer critics are now wondering whether Ford can write about anything other than the subject of that book that is self centered men Two of the three stories in this volume concern the midlife crises of womanizers and all three are deemed mediocre knockoffs of Ford s earlier work littered with characters not complex enough to hold one s interest Christopher Lehmann Haupt the New York Times Some however appreciate Ford s continued explorations of contemporary manhood and its discontents Dan Cryer Newsday and his sinewy prose reminiscent of Twain and Hemingway Michael Gorra the New York Times Book Review Nobody now writing looks more like an American classic says Gorra An excerpt is available at the Knopf site American Scripture Making the Declaration of Independence by Pauline Maier Knopf The latest salvo in the Thomas Jefferson debate claims the Declaration of Independence wasn t his individual handiwork but the product of a committee based on scores of similar documents around the American colonies Most critics find Maier s argument well supported and persuasive An outstanding work of research and analysis written with grace and wit says Slate s John Patrick Diggins But Richard Alan Ryerson in the New York Times Book Review faults Maier for giving short shrift to the document s philosophical underpinnings American Scripture comes close to creating a world without ideas Click here for an excerpt from the book Man Without a Face The Autobiography of Communism s Greatest Spymaster by Markus Wolf with Anne McElvoy Times Books The memoirs of East Germany s Spymaster legendary for helping bring down West German Prime Minister Willy Brandt s government Critics are skeptical about his claim to have known nothing about the East German secret police s brutalities and to have been just a good Jew fighting fascism The dishonesty with which Wolf presents this case is almost childish Ian Buruma the New Republic But a few consider the Dapper Don of the Stasi credible In The New Yorker Robert Harris concurs that Wolf ultimately did little to abet the Communist regime and calls his memoir a testament to the essential uselessness of almost all espionage Art Keith Haring Whitney Museum of American Art New York City The late subway graffitist turned 80s art superstar gets his first major retrospective to grudgingly admiring reviews Most critics fault Haring s work as repetitive and simple But they can t help liking his much merchandised and highly accessible cartoonlike stick figures Only the terminally embittered can fail to love Keith Haring writes Peter Schjeldahl in the Village Voice Haring s enterprise was bigger than art and in its fashion better Haring adds the New York Times Holland Cotter brought entertainment and edification together as later art has rarely

of life in a maximum security prison Critics credit the independence of cable with allowing what broadcast networks won t four letter words grotesque violence abundant male nudity New York s John Leonard calls Oz an ecology and anthropology of terror not for the faint of heart or the queasy of stomach it s not by accident that one con speaks of the penis not the penal system Music Lilith Fair A touring show of female musicians including Sarah McLachlan Sheryl Crow and the Indigo Girls is said to herald the end of male dominance of rock Most reviewers simply cheerlead Its value as a sign of women s achievements and solidarity is already undeniable says the New York Times Jon Pareles Others are less enthusiastic It s almost possible to ignore the exclusion of male artists and think of Lilith as a savvy packaging of the hottest acts says Entertainment Weekly Newsweek predicts it could turn out to have the touchy feely feminist vibe of a grown up slumber party the roster of performers reads like a who s who of political correctness Updates The New Yorker s Adam Gopnik says the Venice Biennale is overpopulated by a ging Pop artists years removed from their best work Jim Dine Claes Oldenburg who sit alongside neo expressionists some of whom Julian Schnabel Francesco Clemente never had best work to be years removed from The New Yorker s Terrence Rafferty breaks with
