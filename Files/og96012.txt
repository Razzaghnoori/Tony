Actions Relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 Section 603 Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The preamble to the proposed rule stated that the entities that would be required to comply with the rule are public utilities and transmitting utilities that do not fall within the Regulatory Flexibility Act s definition of small entity 1 60 Fed Reg 66197 8 Accordingly the Commission certified pursuant to 5 U S C 605 b that the rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and did not prepare an initial regulatory flexibility analysis 60 Fed Reg at 66198 Section 605 b states that the certification and explanatory statement shall be provided to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration SBA In response to our inquiry Commission officials explained that the Commission did not provide a separate certification and statement to SBA because it considers publication of the certification in the Federal Register to be notice to SBA An SBA official has confirmed that some agencies follow this practice and SBA has not objected to it Section 604 Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 1Section 601 3 of title 5 United States Code provides that the term small business generally has the same meaning as the term small business concern under section 3 of the Small Business Act Section 3 of the Small Business Act defines a small business concern as a business which is independently owned and operated and which is not dominant in its field of operation 15 U S C 632 a GAO OGC 96 12 In the preamble to the final rule the Commission reiterated that the rule would only apply to public and transmitting utilities and again certified that the rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act See 61 Fed Reg 21762 Therefore the Commission did not conduct a final regulatory flexibility analysis under 5 U S C 604 a One commenter expressed concern that the Commission would extend the requirement for an open access same time information system OASIS to nonpublic not for profit cooperative utilities and stated that the Commission would then be required to analyze the requirement s effect on those utilities In response the Commission emphasized that the rule would only apply to public utilities that own operate or control transmission facilities subject to the Commission s jurisdiction See 61 Fed Reg at 21763 By letter of May 9 1996 the Commission informed SBA of its certification In light of the Commission s determination that the rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities sections 605 a and c 607 and 609 are inapplicable iii
