                hi my last uh auto repair was my my uh alternator went out i have a nineteen eighty six Toyota uh its a little Tercel   uhhuh     and uh i have a friend a friend whose real good with uh repairing cars so i got him to take the alternator off and take it and uh you know get a replacement part   uhhuh   we went to a uh a a place called Quality Auto Parts an and their parts are supposed to be guaranteed and and everything and theyre theyre uh very reasonable so uh i bought the alternator we put put it on the car and it it didnt work and it blew out all the fuses   oh no   yeah   how much was the alternator   uh i believe something like sixty nine dollars something something on that order   did he did he hook up the wire wiring wrong   no he hooked it up right it it was just that the the part just just didnt fit the car so i took it back and uh he he took the alternator the guy in in the parts shop took the alternator and he put it on the little thing he has in there to test them and uh he said there was nothing wrong with the alternator so we we went back and tried it again put it on again and it still didnt work and we took the car up to um a little place called Pep Boys i dont know if you have them in your area   uhhuh   but uh theyre theyre pretty reasonable uh car repair place also so uh took it up there towed it up there because it you know wouldnt start or anything and this thing just kept blowing out the fuses and uh took them about an an hour to um figure out what was what was blowing the fuse and it was it was the alternator that was blowing the fuse anyway ended up taking it to the Toyota dealer and the only problem was that uh it had to be a genuine Toyota uh alternator because most of the other ones that they say will fit it that that you know they sit in there and everything but theres just some little difference that um causes it not to work   uhhuh they probably built that in so they could make money   and i yeah yeah i guess so and that was my that was my last experience   well i had a weird theres a little sensing device uh in front of my um um im not sure right in front of the fan fan its a its an air conditioner sensing device i dont know why it actually theres a metal piece that fits through the belts uh and somehow that broke off and uh i i still cant figure out how it broke and uh anyway so a this piece obviously um i have a Subaru and uh i think you can only get it through Subaru dealer etcetera so   uhhuh   uh this little sensing device costed like sixty bucks   uhhuh goodness are you able   and and i havent had too many problems with my car i got a eighty eight Subaru GL XT and it uh   uhhuh   uh and then you know just basic maintenance and oil changes an i and i do not do my oil changes and i will not do my oil changes ive i think the first time i tried to do one ended up um trying to get uh you borrowed somebody elses jack and i did this and i went and bought everything so after buying the filter and all the oil youre looking at ten bucks at least or somewhere in there an   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh and then to go to the trouble that i figured its easier spending eighteen bucks at Jiffy Lube   yeah   so that thats um you know  as far as any maintenance on my car that i shy away from the oil changes thats for sure   uhhuh well my car is uh its an eighty six and i really hadnt had any any trouble with it until until that and the car now has a hundred and thirty something thousand miles on it and uh and this was just recent so i really cant complain about this one   how did you put that many miles on it in   um well i used   four or five years   i used to work uh it was a seventy mile trip everyday you know two ways was seventy miles   oh a hundred and forty mile trip   no it was it was just seventy miles yeah   oh thirty five miles each way yeah   and uh i did that for about three years and it really it really added up ive only taken uh maybe two trips that were about four hours long down uh down to Shreveport and uh the rest of it was you know its just basically driving a long ways to work and now i drive like twenty twenty three miles each way so im getting a little a little uh little relief but still i drive a long ways   yeah   but i guess because theyre highway miles you know its not so bad on your car as as if it you know were just regular street   uhhuh do you work for TI   you know yes i do   okay   do you   i was going to ask you you know as far as how were getting compensated for what were doing right now um i dont work for TI and im just i get these green i dont know what you want to call them fake   points   point things        and uh i just wondering how i go about getting my cash   uh theres a number that you call its the same number that you that you call to make a call   oh okay   you you call that number and and uh somehow or another theyll give you an option to leave a message and you can leave a message   okay   i know someone that did that you leave a message and theyll theyll call you back   okay all right well thats good to know i havent been doing this this is the first time ive been called in a long time and i havent been doing it so   oh really   and uh ive done it maybe twelve times   uhhuh well i dont know if ive done it quite that much but uh mine is mixed up too i have to call and get it fixed   um uh lets see before i had this car i had a um um i bought an Audi five thousand   uhhuh   but i bought it i bought it used i i just bought it from a friend who was going to who just charged me what the dealer was going to give give him for it for a tradein and uh it had a whole lot of miles on it i i figured maybe id get one or two years out of it an i an i did get a couple of good years out of it and the uh the engi ne messed up on me and then i gave it to a guy to repair who works for the automotive for the Audi dealer and uh he took the engine apart and you know he just said he couldnt fix it so the engine never got put back together again   huh oh well   i   i was driving a sixty six Plymouth Fury   wow i think those old cars   yeah yep and   might might be a pretty good bet because you i dont know i   oh that thats when they made cars though this things was the body was in good condition and  you know it ran fine it was starting to burn some oil   uhhuh um   and um but i had to you know get you know i after about three couple of months after i was out of college i finally splurged and bought my car so   uhhuh i read a book one time that said that the best cars were made before seventy four   yeah well you know these cars made in the sixties and stuff i mean the steel i mean the thickness i mean it those thing theyre just the you just dont see cars like that and they last a long time and they were simple too the engines were simple and durable and   uhhuh yeah   some people will still buy them you know theyll   yeah its easy to its easy i guess its still easy to find engines for those cars engines and transmissions and if you i guess if you keep trading changing them out you can keep a car for a long time course i guess i could do the same thing with the the Toyota that i have i just dont know how much theyll  charge me to   it always costs so much to fix anything or do anything with it youre just better off buying another car   yeah i guess so but i just think they cost too much in the in the first place now a days
