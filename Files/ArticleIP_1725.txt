you Is it me If not who is it In an op ed article Wednesday in the Financial Times columnist Edward Mortimer said that Saddam and Slobo the presidents of Iraq and Yugoslavia are the true architects of the new world order It is largely in reaction to them that by a series of improvisations the vaunted international community has defined itself They have obliged the United States which after winning the Cold War would have happily left the rest of the world to its own devices to continue with the tiresome business of threatening and using force deploying troops in faraway places and cobbling together coalitions And they had presented the rest of the world with constant dilemmas to demand more U S leadership or less to tag along behind the coalition or to risk being labelled accomplices of evil The legend of U N Secretary General Kofi Annan s triumph in Baghdad underwent further embellishment Wednesday when Le Monde devoted a whole page to a detailed account of the negotiations

coward for failing to join him in a photo call and allegedly keeping him away from the press Despite foreign office denials the Daily Telegraph in an editorial Thursday said Cook showed every sign of
