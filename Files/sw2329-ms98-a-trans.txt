 okay uh are you in the market for a new car uh i ve only purchased one new car in my entire life really right and that was back in nineteen fifty nine and it was a new Ford so the automobiles that that i have uh uh huh first of all we have a source now we got a a friend whose a nun uh huh and we ve been purchasing her cars she buys a brand new car every three or four years oh really and then when she gets ready to trade it in she offers it to us and we buy it well well that s great so if you if you can find a deal like that yeah and uh we ve got we ve got a sixty seven Mustang that we bought brand new oh and we still have that oh that that that s a classic car so yeah it s going to be uh let s see next year i guess it will be an antique next year yeah but the problem with it is up here around there s so much salt on the roads oh really that it s hard to keep automobiles for any length of time because they all rust out and huh i bet that s right i bet that i bet that is true for down well down here we don t have that problem of course yeah uh every once in a while though uh i ll read a blip where you guys get some uh terrible ice storms oh yes we get and then but they don t put salt on the roads down there then they sand the roads and it just turns into a big mess ugh okay so uh but really the when it when it gets uh nasty down here it s like a big huge fender bender parking lot so i just try nobody nobody goes anywhere no one will nobody goes anywhere okay so how about how about you how about purchasing an automobile well uh a couple years ago we we purchased an uh well it wasn t new it wasn t new it was a a a an Astro van and oh okay we really like it because we got uh a two year old and another one on the way so uh yeah we we had a Firebird and we had to trade we guess we got to get rid of this thing because there s no way we can haul kids and junk and stuff with that so we got rid of that and we re really pleased with it yeah so what do you buy what are you looking for you look for an automatic you know you look for something with all the yes i can t drive a standard you can t drive a standard no i can t drive a standard yeah no i used to when i was when i was uh younger uh huh you know but i ve it s been long gone out of my system now i could just put it in home and let it go there and take me there and that s it i don t like any of that yeah but i do like comfort i like uh uh we have bigger automobiles now we ve got Pontiacs uh huh uh i like the comfort you know and and the mileage we get is depending on if it s tuned up or not we get between eighteen and twenty two miles to the gallon uh that s good we you know it s not really all that that doesn t it s it isn t as good as some of the smaller ones you know that they get a zillion miles uh oh yeah but yeah uh that s not one of my first priorities when i m looking for a new car is excellent gas mileage look you what what do you look for uh ease of handling or roominess well my husband has to have a has to drive a pick up so that s so he has his he has a pickup uh uh he drives a small uh S GMC S fifteen which we bought we bought new five years ago and have had real good luck with i mean there s have absolutely no trouble with it yeah that s i i had a pickup truck in fact i had i had two the last one i gave to my uh uh youngest uh huh uh because we used to go we we we uh built our home and we built it to we designed it to be heated by uh wood you know uh uh wood stove yeah uh huh so and i like the i like the warmth and the comfort of it so every winter well i used to go out and chop wood and get it all ready for the next season so a pickup truck was handy for the work i was doing around uh huh oh yeah but now everything s done so i figure instead of doing that i ll just i ll just order wood but uh uh i m just like you gas mileage wasn t a priority hum it was it was comfort and it has to be has to have air oh yes so down down where you guys are down here it s a it s it s it s a necessity it s a necessity yeah when it gets to be a hundred degrees every day for a month and a half yeah that s i had i had gone down to Dallas couple weeks ago it s uh on a seminar for a week oh yeah and that s when you broke all the records was up to like ninety six yeah it was it s pretty warm eighties and you know when i left here and we re down to the thirties and twenties and uh huh so it s a shock so i can see you yeah and you need air you actually need air now it gets warm enough down there for it so yeah i ve i ve in the car i ve been running it uh uh uh uh because it but uh the the weather the weather s just been really nice but i mean you you just can t sell a car down here that does not have air conditi oning in it yeah like we re from Missouri and when we moved oh are you we when we moved down here the our uh the vehicle we had did not have air conditioning and we went through one summer that way and that was it that s when we traded it so that s that s one of your priorities there s got to be air has to be an automatic yes uh how about uh accessories power windows and all that oh that s not really important the the other stuff is just you know window dressing because we we ve never ordered anything fact the the van that we ve got we bought uh from an estate it was an estate trade uh it was almost brand new the the gentlemen who owned it had died uh so we got a really good deal so you got a yeah and it s loaded i mean it it i mean if i would have went to buy that thing new there s no way i could have afforded it yeah but uh since it was a state vehicle we got a really good deal on it but it so if you know if you know where where you re get getting your your automobile from yeah it s best to buy it that way because like our sales tax up here is seven percent oh it s it s eight percent it s eight here it s eight percent down there yes yes so who so if you go out and you re talking like a ten or fifteen thousand dollar vehicle and you add that sales tax on that s a that s a big chunk of change you have to come up with yes it is it and then we have an excise tax up here too i don t know if you have one every year down there oh no so they take the they take the uh whatever the book value of the vehicle is and then whatever your tax rate is and they just tax you every year on the vehicle or two vehicles yes it s terrible oh how awful and in our town we live in a like a rural area and they have a fire tax that they add on too oh how awful so so we ve got to pay a fire tax and we got to pay you know two taxes sounds like you got a a little one there oh she hit her she hit her head now she s fine so oh so once you buy a vehicle and you pay you pay the sales tax that s it they don t tax you on it anymore oh uh property tax the city of Dallas but uh since we moved out of the city of Dallas we don t have to pay property tax on it anymore so that s what they consider property tax it s like like if you own your own home you have to pay property tax right homes vehicles you know everything has everything like that gets uh taxed property uh property tax yeah even if you you know if you don t own it yet it if you re paying off a note you still have to pay property tax on it i still have to pay it yeah that s just like up here too it s like that Mustang that we have the excise tax on it every year there s a minimum you have to pay and and it s only twelve dollars uh huh so we ve got an automobile that s that s got some class to it but i don t really i can t tell now what kind of a car is coming down or what kind of a car i m following unless i get up close enough to read the name on it yeah because they all look the same yes everything look that s it i don t i don t foresee buying us buying an a a vehicle anytime in the near future because we re very pleased with what we ve got plus i don t like anything that they ve come out with yeah and if you take care of it i mean you can get uh some good mileage out of it oh yeah because of the the i m driving a Pontiac now and it s uh it s a sixty seven Pontiac it s got a hundred fifty eight thousand miles on it ooh wee and it s absolutely gorgeous just i mean just glides along and i still get that good mileage and well that s great that i take it back and forth to work and then my wife s got a a an eighty four Parisian Pontiac uh huh and that s a big car it s a V8 four door uh huh and that s got uh a hundred and sixteen thousand miles on it and that runs perfectly well too well that that s great you got a hold of a couple of vehicles uh really good vehicles so when we get like i said you know the next one when she decides to to sell the car she has now i ll end up with the Parisian and my wife will have the newer one of course and yeah so we we just been doing it for years and years and years well down here if you want to go buy a used car it s impossible because they want just as much for a used car as they want for a new car and it it it just does that s incredible it just doesn t make sense to buy a used car down here yeah if you re going to pay the same amount of money and and you don t really know where it came from yeah then you re buying somebody s headaches probably oh you have no idea where it comes from you don t it s yeah and there s no warranty no none so whatever happens to it you re stuck with it yes true unless you buy it from i say somebody you know you know like from a family member or a like that one yeah
