 Learn Politics While You Drive If you want to be a Republican candidate and who doesn t really you need a core set of principles a core set of beliefs a core vision and fire in the belly You must be true to yourself show that you care and treat every voter like a precious soul And don t forget to involve yourself with a high profile cause before you announce your candidacy it ll really help your fund raising I know all this because I have spent the past week listening to Prepare To Win a program of audiotapes and accompanying workbooks I m not kidding from the Republican National Committee four hours 28 speakers senators House members etc and advice on everything from fund raising to hiring staff to wooing the media The RNC is distributing Prepare To Win to hundreds of potential 2000 candidates for Congress state legislatures county commissioner and other offices Would be candidates are supposed to listen while they sleep eat or drive Here s RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson urging Republicans to listen over and over again to the tapes It was inevitable that self improvement culture which has infected every other aspect of American life would eventually contaminate politics At last it has Washington where members of Congress are all well coiffed well spoken well dressed and well prepped makes it easy to forget that politicians are made not born For every Bill Clinton who springs from his mother s womb wearing a blue suit and speaking in sound bites there are scores of awkward ambitious Rotarians needing guidance In days of yore aspiring pols learned their trade by sitting in the party clubhouse But political education has become alarmingly sophisticated since the late 80s when Newt Gingrich s GOPAC began mailing tens of thousands of strategy tapes to Republican activists Both parties now offer seminars training candidates how to run But Prepare To Win marks the first time either party has tried to educate prospective candidates Unlike GOPAC s tapes which mix strategy with red meat ideology Prepare To Win is pure process It mostly ignores Republican positions and concentrates on campaign mechanics Speakers urge you to pay attention to filing deadlines hire a lawyer form a kitchen Cabinet of friends who can rein you in if the campaign unhinges you court community leaders and seek their endorsement before you announce choreograph your announcement to maximize media coverage etc It s all sensible enough especially the presentation of Sen Susan Collins of Maine but it s thunderingly obvious After a couple of hours I began to ask myself How dumb does the Republican Party think I am Listen for example to New Mexico party Chairman John Dendahl s leaden account of how to use humor in your campaign The workbooks exacerbate this condescending simple mindedness The 10 written questions that accompany each speech are of the sort I haven t seen since sixth grade reading comprehension How according to Rep Jennifer Dunn of Washington do you become an Initiator Innovator and Leader What did Rep Ileana Ros Lehtinen of Florida learn as a girl scout leader Answer Be prepared At heart however Prepare To Win is neither commonsensical nor condescending It is deeply so deeply that the speakers aren t even aware of it cynical The superficial premise is that politics is about harnessing your beliefs your honesty and your caring heart for the common good The political veterans dispensing advice genuinely seem to be preaching idealism Speaker after speaker insists that your campaign must be founded on your core principles beliefs vision whatever My favorite workbook question is What are your core principles If you have to ask The tapes overflow with Polonius platitudes Be true to yourself People don t care what you know till they know that you care Sen Sam Brownback of Kansas repeatedly insists that you see people as precious souls not as voters or contributors But it s odd to be celebrating precious souls on a tape series designed to teach candidates exactly how to wring money from contributors and seduce skeptical voters While saying that candidates should be true to themselves the speakers spend the bulk of their time detailing how campaigns are artifice and how candidates must learn to manipulate voters contributors images and reporters This fundamental cynicism reveals itself in countless small ways Here for example Georgia party Chairman Rusty Paul instructs how to make a candidacy announcement political theater with the candidate as the main actor The otherwise admirable Sen Collins counsels listeners to embrace a cause before they become candidates but not because the cause itself matters The cause is a great way to build a contributor base Listen to Rep Dunn as she gives cheerful happy talk advice about how to use anecdotes to show voters that you care about people and not just policy Women she notes are much more responsive to a strong positive message than they are to attacks Then in her final sentence Dunn offers her real advice Leave those attacks for the advertising campaign Overwhelmingly I had the sense that my Prepare To Win instructors had no idea how cynical they sound Nowhere is this more apparent than in the presentation of Sen Kit Bond a folksy Missourian In this clip Bond details his fund raising philosophy He proudly describes how during his first congressional campaign he refused a large contribution from someone who wanted him to change his position on an issue At that moment I made the decision that I am running this campaign I am not going to be told by any contributor that I should take a stand they want me to solely because they would give me money for it I told em no thanks If they want to support me in the objectives I have outlined that s fine but I don t take positions or make votes in response to offers of contributions Bond says this as though recounting some remarkable achievement In fact what his grand principle amounts to is no vote for cash Sen Bond does not take bribes Prepare To Win is this passage writ large Beneath its pious talk of visions and core beliefs it is teaching a lesson about politics that is much shabbier and much more real than the one it pretends to teach
