        do you happen to have a system for budgeting your money     um just sweared i heard that beep but usually you can hear the tape or you can hear it starting  um   oh ive never go ahead   uh no  no i am a very organized person that believes i ought to have all those things and we dont       uhhuh so you its not just you you have a family     yes im married i have two kids um young four and a half and three and as far as sitting down and putting a formal budget paper and pen you know and following it no we dont do that um i have a very good idea of what our expenses are and how much we can afford to spend and cant spend and you know so it its not like we just totally dont have a clue as to whats going on but i wish we were a little more organized a little more   you know when i think about it there are certain parameters we work about   faithful to a budget   but we dont have a budget where it says its so much for this and so much for that but we do put a certain amount in checking account each month which we should pay for the mortgage and the electric bill and all that   right   and i know theres a certain number i put on my grocery and pocket money and sometimes i have a little left over and i kind of put it away but the next week i pull it out and add it to that number     right   and i know that i dont go above that and i know that when we empty out the mortgage and the electric bill money and all that that you know you got to stop spending but you know i i dont know if i can say i guess with the grocery and pocket money i do have a particular number but   thats right thats right   you know you never know if if you own a home you never know if somethings going to break and youre gonna need more   thats right well its very difficult my husband is in is selfemployed hes in uh financial planning and and so all of his income is commissions its very hard to sit down and budget because you dont know what hes going to make uh you know we kind of think you know he usually brings home at least this much and i can base you know base it from there   right   but theres months that he brings home uh you know three times that much and theres some months he doesnt bring home anything it just depends on where the commissions fall and so you kind of have to you know i have in in my mind i know the basics i know what weve got to meet each month you know and and my salary helps towards that because mines set you know but um i think that we could probably save a little better or afford to do more things for fun that wed like to do if i did follow a  you know pencil and paper budget but   do you folks get to save   well differently i mean do i have a savings account sitting in the bank no but uh we do have you know universal life insurance on him we have um a K a CODA plan preretirement plan on me through my work uh so there are things that we have money invested in you know i have a profit sharing and pension uh savings more toward retirement now savings sitting at the bank that hey lets plan a vacation no when we decide we wanna do something like that we start saving for that and when we get it we go   right you know cause i im finding more and more that people dont have so many dollars left after they spend on what they have to spend i i think its the rare person who says well im just putting money away for my kids and and every week puts in fifty dollars or something i dont i think people arent having much left at all nowadays   right i think its more and more difficult i do have savings accounts for my kids at work and um and i use that for their uh life insurance investments uh but i also pull from that and from mine if we need the money you know if you need it for something or like you said the something comes up on the house and youve got to have it well you go deplete those funds and use it you know   right that come from somewhere yeah i work part time im a substitute art teacher   oh   so you know we try to live on my husbands salary and when i want something frivolous that he probably wouldnt agree to i just you know spend my own money or chip it in when you know something big comes up   thats true now we have an interesting arrangement my husband loves golf and im glad he has i mean its his release its his time each week where hes not dad and hes not husband and hes not employee and he you know what im saying its just a release   i thought you said when hes not dead  not dad  well jeez   and no dad  dad  not dead  ill have to work on that uh and and im glad he has that im glad he enjoys it but i used to resent it because i felt like all of our spare money went to his golf i dont particularly have anything i like to do from week to week or day to day or or anything like that and thats fine um and so what i started doing and hes never said you know if i wanted something id look in the checkbook because im to practical and say nah id better not spend the money   uhhuh   well hes never held me back you know hes always said if you want something go get it but i didnt feel comfortable so now when he goes and golfs i take you know if he takes out ten bucks or fifteen bucks or twenty bucks i take the same amount and i stick it in a savings account that i have at the credit union at work   oh   and i save for something i want because
