 Background CFEOM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder that has been linked to the pericentromere of chromosome 12 flanked by marker D12S1584 on the p arm and D12S1668 on the q arm 1 2 The clinical phenotype consists of congenital bilateral ptosis and external ophthalmoplegia with the eyes partially or completely fixed in a hypotrophic or downward position On autopsy CFEOM1 patients appear to be lacking the superior division of cranial nerve III which innervates the levator and superior rectus muscles 3 Whether this disease is caused by a primary defect in the nerve or the muscle remains unclear The disease was initially linked to an 8 centiMorgan region spanning the centromere of chromosome 12 and then further refined to a critical region of 3 cM 1 2 Yeast and bacterial artificial chromosome YAC and BAC contigs have been generated and a positional cloning approach to identify the CFEOM1 causative gene is ongoing Sarcospan is a member of the dystrophin associated protein complex present in skeletal and extraocular muscle 4 5 6 Sarcospan is most tightly associated with the transmembrane sarcoglycan subcomplex mutation of which causes autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy LGMD2C 2F 7 8 9 10 11 Primary mutation of sarcoglycan leads to a variable degree of secondary instability of sarcospan and the non mutant sarcoglycans Sarcospan is homologous to the tetraspanin superfamily members of which have been shown to facilitate both integral membrane and membrane proximal protein interactions involved in many different cellular processes 12 Sarcospan had previously been identified as Krag a gene that is co amplified with Ki ras in the Y1 murine adrenal carcinoma cell line 13 14 Portions of the gene s genomic structure were elucidated at that time and the gene was localized to chromosome 12p11 2 Given the genomic localization of sarcospan in the critical region defined for CFEOM1 and its association with other proteins known to be involved in muscular diseases sarcospan has been proposed as a candidate disease gene for CFEOM1 5 We have refined the previously published genomic structure of sarcospan more fully and screened for mutations in six families with CFEOM1 We have also generated antibodies that recognize human sarcospan and examined extraocular muscle samples from CFEOM1 patients We find sarcospan to be unmutated in all six CFEOM1 families studied and sarcospan immunoreactivity to be identical in control and CFEOM1 extraocular muscle Sarcospan is also shown to map electronically to BACs that are considered to be outside of the CFEOM1 critical region These data make it unlikely that sarcospan or other dystrophin associated proteins are involved in the pathogenesis of CFEOM1 Results Genomic organization of the human sarcospan gene Five independent clones were isolated from a human genomic phage library using hybridization probes that covered the entire coding region of sarcospan Primers within the coding sequence were designed to cross the two known intron exon junctions and other hypothesized junctions The sarcospan open reading frame is encoded by three exons The first exon contains 279 base pairs bp of coding sequence and is extremely G C rich 71 The second exon as previously determined is 87 bp in length The third exon is very large and includes the last 363 bp of coding sequence and over 1500 bp 3 untranslated region UTR Analysis of the CFEOM1 critical region Based on its cytogenetic localization and expression pattern sarcospan is a candidate gene for autosomal dominant CFEOM1 Initially to

BACs while sarcospan primers were not data not shown Mutation Analysis Although the coverage of the YAC and BAC physical maps was nearly complete only direct sequencing of CFEOM1 patient DNA would yield definitive results about the status of the sarcospan gene in CFEOM1 Primer pairs to amplify all of exon 2 and the coding portions of exons 1 and 3 were designed Because of the large 3 UTR present in exon 3 a primer pair was designed to amplify the coding portions of the exon including the 5 splice junction and 40 bp of 3 non coding sequence Figure 1 Two affected individuals from each of six families with CFEOM1 were analyzed by direct sequencing No mutations or polymorphisms were found Immunofluorescence Analysis Samples of CFEOM1 affected and unaffected extraocular muscle were analyzed for the pattern of sarcospan staining Muscle was simultaneously stained with anti spectrin antibody so that the samples membrane integrity could be assessed and a comparison could be made between the levels of sarcospan in normal and CFEOM1 samples All samples showed normal sarcolemmal staining no abnormalities were observed Figure 2 BAC Mapping of Sarcospan Comparison of the sarcospan coding sequence GenBank accession number AF016028 to the human genome sequence revealed that sarcospan is contained on the BACs B283G6 and B612B6 Chromosome 12p map page 1 http sequence aecom yu edu

region for the congenital eye movement disorder CFEOM1 has been reduced to a 3 cM region at the centromere of human chromosome 12 2 In an effort to identify the gene which when mutated gives rise to CFEOM1 a combination of positional and candidate gene approaches has been undertaken The sarcospan gene is composed of three exons that are located on human chromosome 12p11 2 and the sarcospan protein has been shown to be an integral component of the sarcoglycan complex 5 15 16 Mutations in any one of the other four members of this complex have been shown to cause muscular dystrophy As the extraocular muscle is one of the few muscles spared in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy the dystrophin associated protein complex present in extraocular muscle may respond differently to mutation of the complex than other striated muscle 17 18 By virtue of its genomic localization and expression in extraocular muscle sarcospan is a candidate gene for autosomal dominant CFEOM1 We therefore chose to study sarcospan more closely within the context of this disease Immunofluorescence data showed comparable patterns of sarcospan staining in CFEOM1 and control patient samples implying that there was no haplo insufficiency altered accumulation or increased degradation of the sarcospan protein in these patients Direct sequencing of the three coding exons of sarcospan in CFEOM1 patients confirmed that they were normal rendering alteration of the sarcospan protein as the primary genetic defect in CFEOM1 unlikely This conclusion is supported by the electronic localization of sarcospan to BACs outside of the CFEOM1 critical region The normal staining pattern of sarcospan in the autosomal dominant CFEOM1 patient muscle indicates that the primary genetic mutation is likely to be found in another unrelated gene Patients with autosomal dominant limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 1C caused by mutations in caveolin 3 19 20 or autosomal recessive LGMD2B caused by mutations in dysferlin show normal dystrophin and sarcoglycan sarcospan complex staining patterns 21 Sarcospan immunoreactivity is altered in both Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and the sarcoglycanopathies LGMD2C F and appears to be very sensitive to disturbances in the dystrophin associated protein complex 16 Thus the finding that sarcospan is normal in CFEOM1 patient muscle suggests that sarcospan itself and the rest of the dystrophin associated protein complex are not involved in the pathogenesis of the disease A sarcospan null mouse has recently been generated and appears to display a normal phenotype 22 This does not however rule out the possibility of sarcospan playing a primary role in a muscle disorder There may for example be a homologous tetraspanin protein that compensates for the absence of sarcospan in mice but not in humans There is of course also a difference between complete absence of a protein and a protein with an altered sequence This may hold especially true as sarcospan appears to be member of the tetraspanin family of proteins which have been described as molecular facilitators alterations of such a protein s sequence could affect the proteins with which it interacts We are therefore expanding our patient analysis to include patients with other forms of muscular abnormalities including unlinked muscular dystrophies The effort to identify the CFEOM1 disease gene is continuing with analysis of other genes and expressed sequence tags from the critical region at the centromere of chromosome 12 Conclusions The DNA sequence analysis and protein immunofluorescence results that show sarcospan to be normal in CFEOM1 patients combined with the localization of sarcospan to BACs that are outside of the CFEOM1 critical region make it unlikely that sarcospan is involved in CFEOM1
