        okay   i think   yes yes im sure that it   lets see i didnt i didnt hear the message that it says you make the uh maybe i didnt press it hard enough lets try again   okay     hum   well it it just that that uh recording would begin when the person who called presses   right okay so so i will just assume that we are being recorded now i thought that they had a confirmation message when that occurred but perhaps not anyway i did press let me press one once again   one but okay     well ill ill take it that that did it okay so um the answer to that well maybe i should answer the question first since i have had so long to think about it um       i uh use uh a program on my Macintosh which is called Dollars and Cents actually it hails from the bay area where youre from and uh   oh im not in San Francisco im in Frisco Texas   oh Frisco Texas uh gee i dont even know   where are you   Raleigh North Carolina   Raleigh North Carolina i thought you said Rowlett  we have a little town out here yes okay you know where Dallas is     i see okay well anyway it doesnt hail from the area where you are but uh uh anyway uh so so anyway i use this a personal personal accounting program on my Macintosh to keep track of expenses but it also has a budget feature but i dont find it very useful because it makes all kinds of assumptions that arent the case in my situation so i use the the little spread sheets for that i i i dont know actually i think most people who are in the series are a little bit familiar with computers but if youre not let me know and i will give more explanation   oh okay i am familiar i am familiar with computers   okay so have you do you do you use a computer to do your budgeting   no we dont my husband uh takes care of our finances and he just uh just does it all all manually he keeps uh a book sort of   umhum   he uh doesnt keep it on the computer i work with computers and we have one at home but he doesnt use it for that   i found that it was uh you well you have a lot more information if you use a computer because you just cant keep track of everything manually youll never go back through the old slips and see what your electric bill was and so forth but   right   if if you can just print it out it gives you a lot better feel for how you stand compared to last year um   and that is a software program that was written for your uh i mean that you   for Macintosh yes   just for Macintosh   um its called Dollars and Cents and actually the leading program is Managing Your Monies by Andrew Tobias but i used that one year and it was so awful that i just gave up   too much detail   excuse me   was it too much detail to it   it was well it would bring up a new screen for everything you know you you um you would make one entry like for example if you were reconciling your check account and you wanted to change a transaction lets say you wanted to add in interest or put in a fee or something it took about three screens to do that and you could only see the one transaction you were working on all the earlier transactions were hidden it was just it it you just   primitive   yeah it had tunnel vision i mean it had a lot of features but they were all so hard to use that i never never really used any of them so uh i i i read since then though that theyve redesigned redesigned uh redesigned the interface so probably its a little better uh than it was before um so um do you do you do a uh a yearly budget or a monthly budget or   uh i am not sure right now i think he is keeping he has it uh kind of a forecast out for oh about the next uh eighteen months or so he keeps track of all of um you know the the payments that are due when and uh what what pays off when and uh of course he knows ahead of time about when the uh         home owners is due and when the car insurance is due and such like that and he just   right   sort of keeps uh i guess you would say a running record of it so that he he knows at what point uh we are going to be able to to have uh some extra money   umhum uh yeah i try and uh i think that one of the things ive ive worked on is cutting down on the number of transactions uh so so i i instead of paying bills monthly if they are not very much uh i just pay enough for two months when i pay one months bill and that way i have to send you know substantially fewer number of things out in the mail which saves a lot of time   umhum   and uh uh gee i pretty my pay my cable TV annually you get a discount for doing that they give you the thirteenth month of month of service free if they remember   well thats nice   but they say  uh they always forget you  every year they mess it up and forget to give me credit or or or shall i say five out of the last six years so i called in and uh at first i got kind of upset  but now   now you expect it   oh yeah now i know they are going to do that um
