 The Secret Service s Real Secret Last week the federal courts accomplished something no president congressional committee government agency or private organization has been able to They said no to the Secret Service The fight over the protective function privilege has raised complicated delicate and important questions about presidential privacy and the obligations of the Secret Service Is the Secret Service a Praetorian Guard that can abet an imperial president in sleaze and coverup How do we reconcile the president s privacy with law enforcement s demands While the courts have settled the legal issue for the moment pundits continue to masticate these questions dutifully But something is being overlooked in the privilege squabble other complicated delicate and even more important questions about the Secret Service Notably Are there any limits on the amount of money we will spend to protect the president Is it healthy for a democracy to surround its president with a bloated paramilitary security apparatus The real worry about the Secret Service is not as the privilege spat suggests that the president has too much control over it The real worry is that no one has control over it The Secret Service s rise is one of the most remarkable and unremarked stories of government in the last 40 years In an age of open and ostensibly frugal public administration the Secret Service is an anomaly an agency that operates with nearly as much secrecy as the CIA and spends almost as freely as its heart desires How has this happened As David Greenberg chronicles in Slate s Backstory the Secret Service was established in 1865 to fight counterfeiting It began guarding the president regularly in 1901 after the assassination of President William McKinley but remained a modest enterprise until John F Kennedy s murder Since then the Secret Service has experienced the kind of growth that well only stockholders in software companies have come to expect In 1957 it spent 3 5 million and employed 450 This year the Secret Service costs taxpayers about 590 million and employs more than 4 600 people including 2 000 special agents whose responsibilities include presidential protection and 1 200 officers in the Uniformed Division Click for more details about its proliferation The Secret Service is evidence of the Iron Law of Bureaucratic Growth An agency unchecked by outside forces expands The service asks and it is given For fiscal 1999 it requested 594 657 000 in federal funding an increase of more than 5 percent over its 564 million base it receives about 30 million more in other appropriations The House just passed the Secret Service appropriations bill and how much did the agency get Exactly 594 657 000 Congress stiffs other federal programs but all the Secret Service s desires are fulfilled 6 million for four armor plated limousines 3 million for Y2K conversion millions to pay for extra travel expenses 62 million to beef up White House security including new bulletproof windows air defenses and 27 extra security staffers Not that the public can find out much about how the Secret Service spends its money Details about how the president is protected are classified The agency has even removed White House floor plans from the Library of Congress The Secret Service is untouchable Congress is terrified of scrimping on it No one ever wants to not fully fund it says a congressional appropriations staffer No one ever wants to be the one who is responsible for risk or danger to the president Another staffer asks If they say it s necessary for the safety of the president who is going to say no The media too are reluctant to criticize The last major story to question the Secret Service appeared in the New Republic in January 1981 Two months later Reagan was shot When the Secret Service does attract notice it tends to receive coverage best described as Protection Porn Click for an explanation The Secret Service does not hesitate to exploit its Dead President advantage practicing an elegant variation of Fireman First a classic bureaucratic defense mechanism when your budget is threatened propose cutting the fire department On the rare occasions the service is queried it invokes the Dead President A month after the Oklahoma City bombing and without a hearing the Secret Service shut Pennsylvania Avenue and surrounding streets to traffic Washingtonians complained The service declared it was necessary for the safety of the White House and the president The avenue stays closed The privilege squabble in fact marks the first time the Dead President defense has failed In Justice Department briefs and in private meetings the Secret Service insisted that the failure to recognize the privilege would result in profound and predictable peril to the president could mean the difference between life or death would endanger the integrity of our national security etc The appeals court rapped the agency for its scare tactics saying it must base its conclusions on solid facts and a realistic appraisal of the danger rather than on vague fears extrapolated beyond any foreseeable threat The Secret Service is not incompetent or corrupt or even especially greedy In fact it is almost universally admired for its professionalism and efficiency Even so its ascendancy is troublesome It has made standard even admired measures that ought to be intolerable in a democracy A half century ago a president could drive through city streets in a normal car with a few bodyguards and anyone could stroll up to the front door of the White House Of course ours is a different and more dangerous age There are undoubtedly more and more sophisticated threats to the president than we can imagine But the expansion of the Secret Service has normalized a paramilitary presidency No one blinks at 40 car motorcades that shut down interstates and gridlock traffic the 200 plus strong Secret Service delegation that accompanies the president abroad the transformation of the open White House into an impenetrable fortress During public events it is perfectly acceptable for Secret Service agents to approach crowd members and yank their hands out of their pockets to confirm they are not hiding weapons It is unquestioned that the president should be chauffeured in a car that costs 1 5 million It has become a deep inconvenience for average citizens to see their president and a deep inconvenience for the president to see average citizens There is something unseemly about this excessive security and something undemocratic Sen Daniel Patrick Moynihan D N Y perhaps the only lawmaker who ever criticized the Secret Service before the privilege flap said in a 1992 Senate speech that the agency has made the insufferable routine I don t know if the agency itself is aware of how arrogant and presumptuous it has become Two years ago Moynihan remarked that soon the service will have a billion dollar budget And still just one president one vice president It isn t that the Secret Service s precautions are definitively unnecessary It s that no one knows whether they are necessary and no one is willing to ask Perfection is impossible in presidential security No matter how much we spend the goal will always recede A determined assassin will be able to find a way to kill the president And the Secret Service will be able to find a way to spend more money to prevent it In fact the agency seems to have found most of those ways already No one wants the president assassinated But should it be forbidden to ask if we could spend less and do less to protect him If you missed the link to the Backstory on the Secret Service here it is again Here s the and here s the one on
