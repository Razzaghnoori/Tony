            the space program seems to have run into a little bit of a snag funding wise anyway theyve decided the space stations not may not be worth it and uh theyre going to fight over that for a few years it seems and uh just the idea of flight uh the shuttle system and what they thought they could do and what theyre ending up doing and the complexity and the seeming uh number of errors and breakdowns and problems theyre having with it uh it may not be common thing all too soon and even if they ever do get it common uh or get it to where you know the a large percentage or even a a one to two percent of of a given nation ends up in space for for some reason or another um they havent solved and i dont know if they can solve the problem that weightlessness has extended weightlessness has on the human body i mean   right   we can do all we want as far as technology goes but if a human cant stand to be up there then what good does is it to have the station that for extended stays if you cant stand an extended stay   right   so i dont know if uh if all the monies that are being spent on it uh really should be spent with the idea of uh or with the goal of of the space station or of claiming a sector of space or having defense out in space i dont mind spending the money from the standpoint of uh basically government funded uh research and development and you know its tends to create jobs our our economy tends to be uh based on a lot of a lot of that lately of course it really wreaks havoc with the economy when the government decides to shut down things like bases and and uh like  Carswell and things of that nature   right   so what do you think about the the uh whole space program as it were   uh well im im kind of with you theyve theyve definitely run into some problems and i think its its some its its due to their own shortsightedness uh perhaps the trying to do too much too quickly uh and you know they take  take some i think that they thought thought that they were going to get a lot more done quickly than they then they really did they didnt think out all of the the variables that uh that might crop up and then theyve been hit with a lot of those uh a lot of i think theyve had a lot of poorer management poor management here in the past uh several years no no clearly defined goals uh uh a and and goals that are that were obtainable you know they they they needed to look at the long long range picture i think that that   umhum   uh the Soviets have have done a better job of that you know they they were very uh they were limited so much in their technology and but they because of that they they tended to say what were going to do what we do and continue to do it and do it over the long haul and so thats what theyve done and theyve theyve uh you know they theyve had a man in space in space for you know a quite a long time you know in in in in the different space stations that theyve had and uh so that that you know thats been good for them theyve learned a lot and theyve theyve made some achievements in in that respect but theyve theyve been   right   doing it very slowly and very long range you know   umhum   and we havent done that we tend to to look at uh a big uh a big project that we like to to have done you know  you know do the shuttle thing and and and  have it as a you know a space transport system you know up in the next ten years and you cant do that you know i mean its just not not feasible feasible but you know the Americans uh American publics doesnt like to sit back and wait you know ten years for something to get developed and and put up with with especially with funding the way it is yeah   right   uh i uh i think there are definite benefits from from the from the process of of creating space projects you know we you know weve seen that in terms of computers and and the the myriad of different uh technological advances but uh like you say you have to kind of weigh that as to what is it worth in the long you know for for the overall uh picture uh how much we willing to to put out for to have Teflon on our on our our cooking pans and   right you know you really dont want the economy to or the space program to become a too large percentage of the economy so that when something catastrophe some catastrophe does occur and it does have to be curtailed you you dont gut the economy sort of like the defense industry problem has has occurred uh as as needs changed in the defense world then   right   you go and cut back on your spending and it cripples whole sections of the nation as it were with the lack of jobs and lack of whatever else you do that with the space program and now as complex and as many different directions as theyre being tugged with technology uh they want to be so big that if we ever did allow that um uh were liable to be in the same boat and once these contracts are finished or if the space pra platform disintegrated for whatever reason uh maybe thered be that many thousands of jobs that were supplying prats you know parts to that that werent there anymore youd have to go back to the jobs that needed to   right right   be there when that was being created instead of being sustained and you know you you cant have uh a quarter of the economy resting on one little project up there so it it gets kind of complicated when you start talking getting that big plus you get so many different directions uh not being limited by technology here in the US but being limited by the whims of changing funding uh it needs even that much more or or better management from uh the NASA people to keep a clear goal and a relatively a reasonable one in sight as it were   right   so i dont know its a its a complex issue but   you know i i mean i would love to see you know big things like that happen i mean ive you know ive i went through the entire and i grew up in that early sixties you know big big boom of   umhum   of uh you know all those Mercury and Gemini and uh Apollo shots and and and was real caught up in that and would love to see something big happen you know id like to see that that occur but you like you say its its a it is it is a drain and you dont it would cost an enormous amount of money to put that up yeah put something up like a space station that would work and really really be beneficial for us and uh i dont i dont know its if its worth it   well they keep talking about uh the space station the biggest thing they want to do up there is is test out different manufacturing techniques uh in weightlessness but are these i i never could quite figure out whether these techniques were something that could be done   yeah   uh uh simulated or we learn enough about it to do it down here on earth or are we talking about having to build some sort of a station that is going to produce these products and how much could you really produce in a lab up there uh i dont i dont really guess i understand what theyre going to do unless theyre going to turn out product from that
