 Comptroller General of the United States United States General Accounting Office Washington DC 20548 B 287944 August 17 2001 The Vice President of the United States Dear Mr Vice President Pursuant to 31 U S C 716 b I am submitting this report because the Vice President as Chair of the National Energy Policy Development Group NEPDG has not provided the General Accounting Office GAO with access to certain records relating to the process by which the National Energy Policy was developed I requested these records in writing on July 18 2001 in accordance with section 716 Despite repeated attempts we have been unable to resolve this dispute The Vice President and his representatives have asserted that GAO lacks the statutory authority to examine the activities of the NEPDG recognizing only GAO s authority to audit its financial transactions They have also asserted that our examination would unconstitutionally interfere with the functioning of the executive branch In addition to the arguments previously advanced by the Vice President s representatives and addressed in our June 22 letter to the Counsel to the Vice President see Enclosure 1 the Vice President s August 2 letter to the Congress asserts that the study is not authorized by statute because GAO is limited to looking at the results of programs and that GAO does not have a right of access to documents because the Vice President is not included under the term agency used in GAO s statute As discussed below we strongly disagree with the Vice President s positions Disclosing the records we are seeking would not reveal communications between the President and his advisers and would not unconstitutionally interfere with the functioning of the executive branch Furthermore GAO has ample authority to conduct this review and this authority has been recognized by various presidential administrations for many years Finally neither the plain meaning of the statute nor the legislative history supports the Vice President s interpretation of the terms results and agency The GAO as an institution and the Comptroller General as an officer of the legislative branch assist the Congress in exercising its responsibilities under the Constitution to oversee investigate and legislate In order to help members of Congress carry out their role and evaluate the process used to develop the National Energy Policy GAO needs selected factual and non deliberative records that the Vice President as Chair of the NEPDG or others representing the Group are in a position to provide GAO The records we are requesting will assist the review of how the NEPDG spent public funds how it carried out its activities and whether applicable law was followed 1 Descriptions of the records we are requesting our efforts to obtain them and our statutory authorities are summarized below Description of Records Requested In May 2001 the Comptroller General authorized this GAO study based on a request from Representatives John D Dingell and Henry A Waxman Ranking Minority Members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the House Committee on Government Reform respectively Our study is narrowly focused to answer the question What process did the NEPDG use to develop the National Energy Policy To answer that question we have requested documents that provide the following information Who was present at each of the group meetings conducted by the NEPDG What are the names of the professional staff assigned to provide support to NEPDG Who did each of the members of the NEPDG including the Vice President as Chair and its support staff meet with to gather information for the National Energy Policy including the date subject and location of the meetings What direct and indirect costs were incurred in developing the National Energy Policy In communications with the Vice President s Counsel prior to the August 2 letter we offered to eliminate our earlier request for minutes and notes and for the information presented by members of the public Even though we are legally entitled to this information as a matter of comity we are scaling back the records we are requesting to exclude these two items of information 2 Furthermore we have repeatedly emphasized that we are flexible in how information is provided to GAO Despite these and other efforts on our part to resolve the impasse the Vice President s representatives have shown no interest in reaching any accommodation 1 For example the information on who was present at each of the group meetings conducted by the NEPDG can be used to confirm that only full time officers or employees of the federal government attended the meetings and thus rule out the possibility that the Federal Advisory Committee Act FACA is applicable to meetings of the group FACA exempts from its provisions those committees composed wholly of full time federal officers or employees Similarly information on whom individual NEPDG members and staff met with and the dates and subjects of the meetings would be relevant in confirming that meetings with members of the public did not trigger FACA 5 U S C app 2 2000 2 These items of information are described in paragraph 3 d and e and paragraph 4 d and e of our letter of July 18 2001 Efforts to Obtain Records GAO began its efforts to conduct this review on May 7 by following our standard practice of calling a designated contact to set up an initial meeting with NEPDG staff See Enclosure 2 for a chronology of our efforts to obtain the records Numerous phone calls did not produce a meeting date Instead on May 16 the Vice President s Counsel sent GAO a letter questioning the appropriateness of GAO s review expressing reluctance to supply the information requested and asking for a statement of GAO s legal authority to conduct the review We responded on June 1 that the request was consistent with our authorities and asked for access to records containing the information requested On June 7 the Vice President s Counsel again questioned GAO s authority to conduct this review and in our June 22 reply we explained our statutory authorities in detail We also repeated our request for information relevant to our study Subsequent to our June 22 letter GAO officials have engaged in numerous conversations with the Vice President s representatives However in these conversations the Vice President s representatives have focused entirely on their view that GAO lacks authority to conduct this review rather than on reaching an accommodation On July 18 2001 the Comptroller General issued a letter to the Vice President in his capacity as Chair of the NEPDG under 31 U S C 716 b requesting access to certain records relating to our study restating our authority for inspecting the records and the reason for our inspection 3 The Vice President did not respond to GAO with a description of the records withheld and the reasons for withholding them as required by the statute Instead he sent letters to the House of Representatives and the Senate on August 2 2001 to inform them of GAO s actions and to serve as a response to GAO s July 18 letter In these letters he asserted that I exceeded my lawful authority by undertaking this study He also refused to acknowledge GAO s basic statutory authorities and asserts that if the Comptroller General s misconstruction of the statutes were to prevail his conduct would unconstitutionally interfere with the functioning of the Executive Branch When records are not made available to GAO within a reasonable time the provisions of 31 U S C 716 b establish mechanisms for resolution of GAO access to records problems Section 716 b 1 provides that when GAO is not given access to records within a reasonable time the Comptroller General may make a written request for such records to the agency head The official then has 20 days to respond and the response is required to describe the record withheld and the reason the record is being withheld If GAO is not given an opportunity to inspect the record during this time period the Comptroller General may file a report to the President the Congress and other executive branch officials Twenty days after filing the report the Comptroller General may bring a civil action in the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia to require the official involved to produce the withheld records As this letter makes clear as Comptroller General of the United States I have broad discretion to conduct audits investigations and examinations of executive branch activities either at the request of Congress or on my own authority Furthermore we do not agree that disclosure of the limited factual and non deliberative information we are seeking such as the names of participants at meetings would unconstitutionally interfere with the functioning of the executive branch In support of this proposition the Vice President s August 2 letter states that preservation of the ability of the executive branch to function effectively requires respecting the confidentiality of communications among a President a Vice President the President s other senior advisers and others However as we have made clear in several discussions with the Vice President s representatives we are not asking for any communications involving the President the Vice President or the President s senior advisers We are simply asking for facts that the Vice President as Chair of the NEPDG or others representing the group would be in a position to provide to GAO These include the names of attendees dates and locations and the subjects of the meetings The Vice President has also expressed concern regarding certain requests for his personal schedule We understand and appreciate the Vice President s concerns regarding release of his personal schedule As a result we have made clear to the Vice President s representatives that we are not seeking a copy of his calendar or information on meetings held other than in his capacity as Chair of the NEPDG As we have emphasized we are seeking certain factual information on meetings the Vice President held in his capacity as Chair of the Group Although the Vice President did not use the term Executive Privilege in his August 2 letter his assertion that providing these facts would unconstitutionally interfere with the executive branch and his focus on confidentiality of communications use the same language and reasoning as assertions of Executive Privilege 4 In our view the information that GAO seeks is not protected by Executive Privilege As noted above the information we are seeking is factual and non deliberative in nature In fact the Vice President s Counsel has already informed the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the House Committee on Government Reform that the meetings the support staff and other NEPDG members had were to gather information relevant to the NEPDG s work and were not deliberative in The right to invoke Executive Privilege rests with the President and Presidents have had different procedures for asserting it President Reagan for example required the agency head if a substantial question was raised to notify and consult with the Attorney General and the White House Counsel s Office The President would decide whether to assert the privilege President Clinton modified President Reagan s policy by requiring the agency head to directly notify the White House Counsel The White House Counsel was to seek an accommodation and if unsuccessful to consult with the Attorney General Again the President determined whether to invoke the privilege 5 nature Even where the President has made a formal claim of Executive Privilege which is not the case here federal courts have held that the executive and legislative branches have a duty to attempt to reach a mutual accommodation 6 As we have stated earlier the Vice President s representatives have declined to discuss reaching any accommodation The information we are seeking is of the type that has been commonly provided to GAO for many years spanning several administrations Furthermore in prior GAO reviews of working groups established by the President we have received information on participation by outside parties Most recently GAO reviewed activities of the White House China Trade Relations Working Group which was established at the request of President Clinton in the exercise of his Constitutional powers In this review GAO was provided thousands of documents including copies of e mails and other information identifying group members contacts with outside groups and individuals Previously at the request of the Republican Ranking Minority Member of the House Committee on Government Operations GAO reviewed activities of President Clinton s Task Force on Health Care Reform and was provided with an extensive listing of working group participants drawn from the government and from outside organizations Moreover some members of the NEPDG have already provided us with information identical in kind to the type of information we are seeking from the Vice President in his capacity as Chair of the NEPDG and from NEPDG staff members For example the Secretaries of Energy and Interior and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency have provided us with information concerning who they met with to develop the National Energy Policy when the meetings occurred where they occurred and what the general topics were GAO s Basic Audit Authority GAO s basic authority stems from the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 which as discussed below provides GAO with broad and comprehensive authority to investigate all matters relating to the use of public money Succeeding legislation affecting GAO s authority has generally served to emphasize the role of review and analysis by GAO as a means of enhancing congressional oversight over activities of the executive branch 7 The 5 Letter from David S Addington Counsel to the Vice President to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the House Committee on Government Reform May 4 2001 The letter enclosed the responses of the Executive Director of the NEPDG to a letter dated April 19 2001 from the Ranking Minority Members of the two committees 6 See e g United States v American Telephone and Telegraph Co 567 F 2d 121 D C Cir 1977 7 As the principal legislative history accompanying the General Accounting Office Act of 1980 explains With the growth in the number of Federal programs and agencies the Congress has by necessity become more dependent on GAO assistance in fulfilling its oversight and legislative responsibilities GAO not only provides Congress with essential information about Federal programs but also uniquely exercises statutory authority to continued GAO headed by the Comptroller General is a principal means by which the legislative branch conducts oversight of executive programs and activities 8 Notwithstanding the broad authority vested in GAO and the Comptroller General by the Congress the Vice President s August 2 letter again questioned GAO s basic authority to do this review However as we explained in our June 22 2001 letter to the Counsel to the Vice President our inquiry is authorized by 31 U S C 712 and 717 Section 712 1 authorizes GAO to investigate all matters related to the receipt disbursement and use of public money and there is no doubt that public money was used to fund the activities of the NEPDG The Counsel has asserted that section 712 1 limits GAO s audit authority to financial transactions As we explained in our June 22 letter the Counsel s narrow interpretation of section 712 is inconsistent with the language and legislative history of the statute as well as years of GAO practice The statute extends GAO s audit authority to all matters related to the use of public money not just costs of activities Section 717 b also clearly authorizes this study It provides that the Comptroller General shall evaluate the results of a program or activity the Government carries out under existing law The Counsel s assertion that the phrase existing law is limited to statutes and excludes the Constitution is unsupported As we explained in our June 22 letter the Counsel failed to supply any evidence from the statutory language legislative history or case law to support the assertion that Congress intended the phrase existing law to exclude the Constitution the highest law of the land The Vice President s August 2 letter noted that section 717 authorizes GAO to review the results of agency programs and activities and stated that the Comptroller General is not evaluating the results of the Group s work he is attempting to inquire into the process by which the results of the Group s work were reached In effect the August 2 letter suggests that section 717 does not provide GAO with authority to review the processes an agency follows in establishing or implementing a program or activity We strongly disagree with this view The Presidential Memorandum establishing the NEPDG provided that one of the results of this action would be the gathering of information relevant to a national energy policy Thus the meetings that are the focus of our review were the result of a governmental activity the establishment of the NEPDG The NEPDG carried out many activities the results of which are subject to evaluation by GAO under the plain meaning of the statute However the Vice President s August 2 letter in effect interprets results as being restricted to end results or ultimate results Under this narrow construction of the statute GAO would be prohibited continued participate directly in the oversight process as an independent congressional entity S Rep No 96 570 at 2 1979 reprinted in 1980 U S C C A N 732 733 8 Id at 1 from scrutinizing any agency activity except the final program result Thus even if GAO were able to identify certain deficiencies in a land management plan for example GAO would be prohibited from examining the process used to develop the plan in order to suggest improvements This would clearly be contrary to the role that Congress has established for GAO There is no indication in section 717 or its legislative history that Congress intended to take such a narrow view of GAO s authority In fact GAO has long interpreted its audit authority as encompassing reviews of agency processes This position which has not been challenged by any prior administration is reflected in the many congressional requests we receive to review agency processes for a broad variety of activities Several recent examples include GAO s review of the process the Forest Service used to modify the Tongass National Forest plan 9 the process used by NASA to contract for the design and delivery of the international space station propulsion module 10 and the process used by the Army Corps of Engineers in preparing an environmental impact statement for actions related to the Snake River dams 11 The legislative history of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 which enacted the authority now contained in section 717 b supports a broad interpretation of GAO s authority The objective was to enhance GAO s role of review and analysis as part of a larger effort to fortify congressional oversight by mak ing more information available to Members and Committees of the Congress and provid ing them a means of interpreting the information they have 12 Clearly it would have been contrary to the overall thrust of the Act for Congress to exclude from GAO s purview agency processes and activities that are routinely the subject of congressional oversight 13 Accordingly it is unreasonable to conclude that by using the term results in section 717 Congress intended to limit and restrict GAO s review authority to simply reviewing end results Moreover in any event 9 Tongass National Forest Process Used to Modify the Forest Plan GAO RCED 00 45 April 17 2000 10 International Space Station Propulsion Module Procurement Process GAO 01 576R April 26 2001 11 Army Corps of Engineers An Assessment of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement of the Lower Snake River Dams GAO RCED 00 186 July 24 2000 12 H R Rep No 91 1215 at 12 13 reprinted in 1970 U S C C A N 4417 4428 13 There is no question that Congress has expansive oversight powers with respect to agency processes and activities Numerous Supreme Court precedents recognize a broad and encompassing power in Congress to engage in oversight and investigation Thus in Eastland v United States Servicemen s Fund 421 U S 491 504 n 15 1975 the Court stated that the scope of Congress power of inquiry is as penetrating and far reaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the Constitution section 712 grants GAO broad authority to investigate all matters related to the use of public money and necessarily includes the agency processes in implementing programs 14 While generally asserting that GAO lacks authority to do this review the Vice President has acknowledged GAO s authority in one area agreeing that we can look into the direct and indirect expenses of the NEPDG under section 712 To this end on June 21 his representatives provided us with 77 pages of miscellaneous documents purporting to relate to direct and indirect costs incurred in the development of the National Energy Policy As we have advised the Vice President s representatives the submission is incomplete and is not fully responsive Moreover it is virtually impossible to analyze the documentation 15 We cannot do a meaningful review without an explanation of the nature and purposes of these costs and the appropriation that was charged Thus far we have sought to obtain adequate relevant records and explanations without success GAO s Statutory Right of Access The Vice President in his August 2 letter also asserts that the term agency in 31 U S C 716 does not include the Vice President because he is a constitutional officer of the government However as noted above we are requesting records from the Vice President in his capacity as Chair of the NEPDG The Vice President provides no support for interpreting the term agency in Title 31 as excluding the NEPDG Title 31 defines an agency subject to GAO s authority very expansively to mean a department agency or instrumentality of the United States government but not the legislative branch or the Supreme Court As broadly as the term agency is now defined the statutory language before the codification of Title 31 in 1982 emphasizes its expansiveness Before the codification the relevant term was department or establishment defined in 31 U S C 2 1976 to include any executive department independent commission board bureau office agency or other establishment of the Government Given the breadth of the statutory language the NEPDG as chaired by the Vice President is clearly an agency under Title 31 of the United States Code The legislative history of the General Accounting Office Act of 1980 which amended GAO s access statute now 31 U S C 716 to authorize GAO to enforce its right of access to agency records made it abundantly clear that Congress viewed the President and his 14 See Enclosure 1 pp 3 5 for a fuller discussion 15 For example some pages provided are simply numbers or dollar amounts without an indication of the nature or purpose associated with the amount or consist only of a drawing of cell or desk phones Others have multiple charges for moving phones or other equipment without identifying whether the moves were for NEPDG staff and which of the multiple charges are relevant to the moves In addition there is nothing that identifies the support staff and the White House Fellow referred to as the group support staff assigned to provide support to the NEPDG closest advisers as being within GAO s access authority and subject to access enforcement actions A key purpose of the 1980 Act was to strengthen GAO s ability to obtain access to records in the face of opposition by agencies including the White House The principal legislative history accompanying the Act16 chronicled the different access problems GAO had encountered in obtaining records to which it was legally entitled including serious access to records difficulties at the White House These included an audit that required GAO to obtain unemployment estimates from the Council of Economic Advisers 17 The Senate report accompanying the 1980 Act explicitly recognized that the President and his principal advisers and assistants are within the scope of GAO s access rights and enforcement authority 18 In order to accommodate executive branch concerns about the extent to which GAO could judicially compel disclosure of highly sensitive information Congress added the certification mechanism This enables the President and the Director of the Office and Management and Budget OMB to preclude a suit by the Comptroller General under certain special conditions 19 As the Senate report explained W ith regard to enforcement actions at the Presidential level certifications provided for under section 102 d 3 now section 716 d 1 C are intended to authorize the President and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to preclude a suit by the Comptroller General against the President and his principal advisers and assistants and against those units within the Executive Office of the President whose sole function is to advise and assist the President for information which would not be available under the Freedom of Information Act 20 16 S Rep No 96 570 reprinted in 1980 U S C C A N 732 17 The Justice Department ultimately conceded that the Council of Economic Advisors was subject to GAO s access authority and provided the records In this regard during hearings that predated the 1980 Act the Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel testified T he long and the short of it is that virtually every piece of information that was requested was eventually provided and it was provided because the Attorney General said this is what we think the law requires GAO Legislation Hearings before the Subcomm on Energy Nuclear Proliferation and Federal Services of the Senate Comm on Governmental Affairs 96th Cong 78 1979 18 S Rep No 96 570 at 8 reprinted in 1980 U S C C A N at 739 19 The certification provision now contained in 31 U S C 716 d 1 C precludes a suit by the Comptroller General if the President or Director of OMB certifies that 1 the records could be withheld under either of two Freedom of Information Act exemptions in 5 U S C 552 b 5 deliberative process and 5 U S C 552 b 7 law enforcement records and 2 disclosure could reasonably be expected to impair substantially the operation of the government 20 S Rep No 96 570 at 8 reprinted in 1980 U S C C A N at 739 Thus it is clear that Congress crafted the certification provision as a carefully balanced compromise that ensures the President can protect the confidentiality of highly sensitive information the disclosure of which would substantially impair the operations of government while affording the Comptroller General the access to information he needs to fulfill his responsibilities under the law Congress would not have needed to add the certification provision to protect the presidential advisers if their records were not within the scope of GAO s access authority Submission of Report Since GAO has a legal right of access to the requested documents and since full access was not provided within 20 days following our July 18 letter pursuant to 31 U S C 716 b 1 I now submit this report to you and the other designated officials Unless an exemption under section 716 d 1 is invoked such as certification by the President or Director of OMB I am authorized to bring a civil action for judicial enforcement of our access request if full and complete access to the records we are requesting is not provided to GAO within 20 days following the filing of this report I seek your assistance in resolving this matter in a timely manner We are hopeful that this pending access problem can be resolved expeditiously without litigation and in a manner that will allow us to fulfill our oversight and reporting responsibilities to the Congress If you or your representatives have any questions or would like to meet to resolve this issue please contact me at 202 512 5500 or Anthony Gamboa General Counsel at 202 5125400 Thank you for your time and attention to this important matter Respectfully yours signed David M Walker Comptroller General of the United States Enclosure 1 June 22 2001 letter from the General Counsel of GAO to
