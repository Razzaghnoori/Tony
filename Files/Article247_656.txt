 Shuttered to Think USA Today and the New York Times lead with the U S decision in the wake of the African embassy bombings to shut some embassies in order to update their security The Washington Post goes with word that Kenneth Starr s upcoming report to Congress will focus on evidence of possible impeachable acts relating to President Clinton s relationship with Monica Lewinsky and will not even include the Arkansas financial dealings that Starr has been investigating for four years The WP front ignores embassy security and the USAT and Times fronts ignore Starr USAT and the NYT report that the State Dept says it has received more than a dozen threats to embassies since the African bombings but that State is emphasizing embassies are not being closed permanently Indeed the NYT suggests the downtime might be just a matter of days USAT quotes the AP s identification of three of the affected sites the embassies in Uganda Malaysia and Swaziland The Times also names Uganda and Malaysia but refers only to a several hours evacuation at the Swaziland embassy in response to a bomb threat The paper adds that the embassy in the Ivory Coast is cutting back its business hours while security is improved and that the Cairo offices of the U S Agency for International Development were closed and its employees moved into the city s U S embassy This space often notes how USAT headlines cut to the chase but its headline over this story U S To Shut Embassies To Fix Security cuts too much with its suggestion that all embassies are being affected Better is the NYT header U S Closes Down Some Operations in Foreign Posts The WP s account of the Starr report to Congress notes that he will eventually produce a separate and more inclusive document for the judicial panel that appointed him In the meantime though the paper explains the pared down Lewinsky report will get to Congress quickly probably shortly after President Clinton testifies to the Starr grand jury in plenty of time to leak out and produce much partisan acrimony during the fall elections The NYT and USAT top fronts feature stories about yesterday s court proceeding in Arkansas in which a twelve year old and a fourteen year old were given the strictest sentence available to juveniles for shooting to death four students and a teacher confinement in a juvenile detention center until age 18 One of the boys made no formal statement in court while the other apologized but also said he meant to shoot over everybody s head The Times notes that in Arkansas juvenile proceedings are usually closed to the public and press but that the judge in this case had allowed a more open hearing And the nation s newspaper editors seem to have likewise loosened up on juvenile coverage in this case the papers run the boys names and indeed the fronts of the NYT WP and USAT all feature pictures of them Just what are the papers policies in this area It s hard to figure out from what they publish just yesterday the papers told the tale of two boys age 7 and 8 arrested for murdering an 11 year old girl without publishing their pictures or their names The WP reports that the three year old Korean War Memorial built in Washington D C by the Army Corps of Engineers needs 2 million to fix buckled paving stones 40 dead shade trees and a leaking Pool of Remembrance Shouldn t a war memorial be built to last longer than the war it s a memorial to The Wall Street Journal runs a front page feature describing a new type of medical consultant service for about 800 a year you get access to a doctor who when you get sick advises you how to best navigate the health care bureaucracy The paper says such a development points the way to a multitiered medical system where the quality of medical care might depend even more than it does today on a patient s wealth The WP reports that last week s signing into law by President Clinton of a comprehensive job training bill got lost in the backdraft of the Monica Lewinsky investigation The paper adds that little seems to be getting done in the capital these days and when it does it barely causes a ripple The story runs on page six
