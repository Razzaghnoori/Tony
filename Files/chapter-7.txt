                        THE ATTACK LOOMS            FIRST ARRIVALS IN CALIFORNIA            In chapter  we described the Southeast Asia travels of Nawaf al Hazmi Khalid al                Mihdhar and others in January  on the first part of the planes operation In                that chapter we also described how Mihdhar was spotted in Kuala Lumpur early in                January  along with associates who were not identified and then was lost to                sight when the group passed through Bangkok On January  Hazmi and Mihdhar                arrived in Los Angeles They spent about two weeks there before moving on to San                    Diego                        Two Weeks in Los Angeles            Why Hazmi and Mihdhar came to California we do not know for certain Khalid Sheikh                Mohammed KSM the organizer of the planes operation explains that California was                a convenient point of entry from Asia and had the added benefit of being far away                from the intended target area                        Hazmi and Mihdhar were illprepared for a mission in the United States Their only                qualifications for this plot were their devotion to Usama Bin Ladin their veteran                service and their ability to get valid US visas Neither had spent any                substantial time in the West and neither spoke much if any English                        It would therefore be plausible that they or KSM would have tried to identify in                advance a friendly contact for them in the United States In detention KSM denies                that al Qaeda had any agents in Southern California We do not credit this                denialWe believe it is unlikely that Hazmi and Mihdharneither of whom in                contrast to the Hamburg group had any prior exposure to life in the Westwould have                come to the United States without arranging to receive assistance from one or more                individuals informed in advance of their arrival                        KSM says that though he told others involved in the conspiracy to stay away from                mosques and to avoid establishing personal contacts he made an exception in this                case and instructed Hazmi and Mihdhar to pose as newly arrived Saudi students and                seek assistance at local mosques He counted on their breaking off any such                relationships once they moved to the East Coast                        Our inability to ascertain the activities of Hazmi and Mihdhar during their first two                weeks in the United States may reflect al Qaeda tradecraft designed to protect the                identity of anyone who may have assisted them during that period Hazmi and Mihdhar                were directed to enroll in Englishlanguage classes upon arriving in Southern                California so that they could begin pilot training as soon as possible KSM claims                to have steered the two to San Diego on the basis of his own research which                supposedly included thumbing through a San Diego phone book acquired at a Karachi                flea market Contradicting himself he also says that as instructed they attempted                to enroll in three language schools in Los Angeles                        After the pair cleared Immigration and Customs at Los Angeles International Airport                we do not know where they wentThey appear to have obtained assistance from the                Muslim community specifically the community surrounding the King Fahd mosque in                Culver City one of the most prominent mosques in Southern California            It is fairly certain that Hazmi and Mihdhar spent time at the King Fahd mosque and                made some acquaintances there One witness interviewed by the FBI after the                September  attacks has said he first met the hijackers at the mosque in early                 Furthermore one of the people who would befriend thema man named Mohdar                Abdullahrecalled a trip with Hazmi and Mihdhar to Los Angeles in June when on                their arrival the three went to the King Fahd mosque There Hazmi and Mihdhar                greeted various individuals whom they appeared to have met previously including a                man named Khallam In Abdullahs telling when Khallam visited the al Qaeda                operatives at their motel that evening Abdullah was asked to leave the room so that                Hazmi Mihdhar and Khallam could meet in private The identity of Khallam and his                purpose in meeting with Hazmi and Mihdhar remain unknown                        To understand what Hazmi and Mihdhar did in their first weeks in the United States                evidently staying in Los Angeles we have investigated whether anyone associated                with the King Fahd mosque assisted them This subject has received substantial                attention in the media Some have speculated that Fahad al Thumairyan imam at the                mosque and an accredited diplomat at the Saudi Arabian consulate from  until                may have played a role in helping the hijackers establish themselves on their                arrival in Los Angeles This speculation is based at least in part on Thumairys                reported leadership of an extremist faction at the mosque                        A wellknown figure at the King Fahd mosque and within the Los Angeles Muslim                community Thumairy was reputed to be an Islamic fundamentalist and a strict                adherent to orthodox Wahhabi doctrine Some Muslims concerned about his preaching                have said he injected nonIslamic themes into his guidanceprayers at the King                Fahd Mosque and had followers supportive of the events of September                      Thumairy appears to have associated with a                particularly radical faction within the community of local worshippers and had a                network of contacts in other cities in the United States After  Thumairys                conduct was a subject of internal debate among some Saudi officials He apparently                lost his position at the King Fahd mosque possibly because of his immoderate                reputation On May   Thumairy attempted to reenter the United States from                Saudi Arabia but was refused entry based on a determination by the State Department                that he might be connected with terrorist activity                        When interviewed by both the FBI and the Commission staff Thumairy has denied                preaching antiWestern sermons much less promoting violent jihad More to the                point he claimed not to recognize either Hazmi or Mihdhar Both denials are                somewhat suspect He likewise denied knowing Omar al Bayoumia man from San Diego                we will discuss shortlyeven though witnesses and telephone records establish that                the two men had contact with each other Similarly Thumairys claim not to know                Mohdar Abdullah is belied by Abdullahs contrary assertion On the other hand                Thumairy undoubtedly met with and provided religious counseling to countless                individuals during his tenure at the King Fahd mosque so he might not remember two                transients like Hazmi and Mihdhar several years later                        The circumstantial evidence makes Thumairy a logical person to consider as a possible                contact for Hazmi and Mihdhar Yet after exploring the available leads we have not                found evidence that Thumairy provided assistance to the two operatives                        We do not pick up their trail until February   when they encountered Omar al                Bayoumi and Caysan Bin Don at a halal food restaurant on Venice Boulevard in Culver                City a few blocks away from the King Fahd mosque Bayoumi and Bin Don have both                told us that they had driven up from San Diego earlier that day so that Bayoumi                could address a visa issue and collect some papers from the Saudi consulate Bayoumi                heard Hazmi and Mihdhar speaking in what he recognized to be Gulf Arabic and struck                up a conversation Since Bin Don knew only a little Arabic he had to rely heavily                on Bayoumi to translate for him                        Mihdhar and Hazmi said they were students from Saudi Arabia who had just arrived in                the United States to study English They said they were living in an apartment near                the restaurant but did not specify the address They did not like Los Angeles and                were having a hard time especially because they did not know anyone Bayoumi told                them how pleasant San Diego was and offered to help them settle there The two pairs                then left the restaurant and went their separate ways                        Bayoumi and Bin Don have been interviewed many times about the February                  lunch For the most part their respective accounts corroborate each other However                Bayoumi has said that he and Bin Don attempted to visit the King Fahd mosque after                lunch but could not find it Bin Don on the other hand recalls visiting the mosque                twice that day for prayers both before and after the meal Bin Dons recollection                is spotty and inconsistent Bayoumis version can be challenged as well since the                mosque is close to the restaurant and Bayoumi had visited it and the surrounding                area on multiple occasions including twice within six weeks of February  We do                not know whether the lunch encounter occurred by chance or design We know about it                because Bayoumi told law enforcement that it happened                        Bayoumi then  years old was in the United States as a business student supported                by a private contractor for the Saudi Civil Aviation Authority where Bayoumi had                worked for over  years                        The object of considerable media speculation following  he lives now in Saudi                Arabia well aware of his notoriety Both we and the FBI have interviewed him and                investigated evidence about him            Bayoumi is a devout Muslim obliging and gregarious He spent much of his spare time                involved in religious study and helping run a mosque in El Cajon about  miles                from San Diego It is certainly possible that he has dissembled about some aspects                of his story perhaps to counter suspicion On the other hand we have seen no                credible evidence that he believed in violent extremism or knowingly aided extremist                    groups                        Our investigators who have dealt directly with him and studied his background find                him to be an unlikely candidate for clandestine involvement with Islamist                extremists The Move to San Diego By February  Hazmi and Mihdhar had come to San                Diego from Los Angeles possibly driven by Mohdar Abdullah Abdullah a Yemeni                university student in his early s is fluent in both Arabic and English and was                perfectly suited to assist the hijackers in pursuing their mission                        After  Abdullah was interviewed many times by the FBI He admitted knowing of                Hazmi and Mihdhars extremist leanings and Mihdhars involvement with the Islamic                Army of Aden a group with ties to al Qaeda back in Yemen Abdullah clearly was                sympathetic to those extremist views During a post search of his possessions                the FBI found a notebook belonging to someone else with references to planes                falling from the sky mass killing and hijacking Further when detained as a                material witness following the  attacks Abdullah expressed hatred for the US                government and stated that the US brought this on themselves                        When interviewed by the FBI after  Abdullah denied having advance knowledge of                attacks In May  however we learned of reports about Abdullah bragging to                fellow inmates at a California prison in September October  that he had known                Hazmi and Mihdhar were planning a terrorist attack The stories attributed to                Abdullah are not entirely consistent with each other Specifically according to one                inmate Abdullah claimed an unnamed individual had notified him that Hazmi and                Mihdhar would be arriving in Los Angeles with plans to carry out an attack Abdullah                allegedly told the same inmate that he had driven the two al Qaeda operatives from                Los Angeles to San Diego but did not say when this occurred We have been unable to                corroborate this account                        Another inmate has recalled Abdullah claiming he first heard about the hijackers                terrorist plans after they arrived in San Diego when they told him they planned to                fly an airplane into a building and invited him to join them on the plane According                to this inmate Abdullah also claimed to have found out about the  attacks three                weeks in advance a claim that appears to dovetail with evidence that Abdullah may                have received a phone call from Hazmi around that time that he stopped making calls                from his telephone after August   and that according to his friends he                started acting strangely                        Although boasts among prison inmates often tend to be unreliable this evidence is                obviously important To date neither we nor the FBI have been able to verify                Abdullahs alleged jailhouse statements despite investigative efforts We thus do                not know when or how Hazmi and Mihdhar first came to San Diego We do know that on                February  they went to the Islamic Center of San Diego to find Omar al Bayoumi and                take him up on his offer of help Bayoumi obliged by not only locating an apartment                but also helping them fill out the lease application cosigning the lease and when                the real estate agent refused to take cash for a deposit helping them open a bank                account which they did with a  deposit he then provided a certified check                from his own account for which the al Qaeda operatives reimbursed him on the spot                for the deposit Neither then nor later did Bayoumi give money to either Hazmi or                Mihdhar who had received money from KSM                        Hazmi and Mihdhar moved in with no furniture and practically no possessions Soon                after the move Bayoumi used their apartment for a party attended by some  male                members of the Muslim community At Bayoumis request Bin Don videotaped the                gathering with Bayoumis video camera Hazmi and Mihdhar did not mingle with the                other guests and reportedly spent most of the party by themselves off camera in a                back room                        Hazmi and Mihdhar immediately started looking for a different place to stay Based on                their comment to Bayoumi about the first apartment being expensive one might infer                that they wanted to save money They may also have been reconsidering the wisdom of                living so close to the video camerawielding Bayoumi who Hazmi seemed to think was                some sort of Saudi spy Just over a week after moving in Hazmi and Mihdhar filed a                day notice of intention to vacate Bayoumi apparently loaned them his cell phone                to help them check out possibilities for new accommodations                        Their initial effort to move turned out poorly An acquaintance arranged with his                landlord to have Mihdhar take over his apartment Mihdhar put down a  deposit                and signed a lease for the apartment effective March  Several weeks later Mihdhar                sought a refund of his deposit claiming he no longer intended to move in because                the apartment was too messy When the landlord refused to refund the deposit                Mihdhar became belligerent The landlord remembers him ranting and raving as if he                were psychotic                        Hazmi and Mihdhar finally found a room to rent in the home of an individual they had                met at a mosque in San Diego According to the homeowner the future hijackers moved                in on May   Mihdhar moved out after only about a month On June  he left                San Diego to return to Yemen Hazmi on the other hand stayed at this house for the                rest of his time in California until midDecember he would then leave for Arizona                with a newly arrived  hijackerpilot Hani Hanjour                        While in San Diego Hazmi and Mihdhar played the part of recently arrived foreign                students They continued to reach out to members of the Muslim community for help                At least initially they found wellmeaning new acquaintances at the Islamic Center                of San Diego which was only a stones throw from the apartment where they first                lived For example when they purchased a used car with cash they bought it from                a man who lived across the street from the Islamic Center and who let them use his                address in registering the vehicle an accommodation to help a fellow Muslim                brother Similarly in April when their cash supply may have been dwindling Hazmi                persuaded the administrator of the Islamic Center to let him use the administrators                bank account to receive a  wire transfer from someone in Dubai in the United                Arab Emirates this was KSMs nephew Ali Abdul Aziz Ali Hazmi and Mihdhar                visited other mosques as well mixing comfortably as devout worshippers During the                operatives critical first weeks in San Diego Mohdar Abdullah helped them                Translating between English and Arabic he assisted them in obtaining California                drivers licenses and with applying to language and flight schools Abdullah also                introduced them to his circle of friends he shared an apartment with some of those                friends near the Rabat mosque in La Mesa a few miles from the hijackers                    residence                        Abdullah has emerged as a key associate of Hazmi and Mihdhar in San Diego Detained                after  first as a material witness then on immigration charges he was                deported to Yemen on May   after the US Attorney for the Southern District                of California declined to prosecute him on charges arising out of his alleged                jailhouse admissions concerning the  operatives The Department of Justice                declined to delay his removal pending further investigation of this new                    information                        Other friends of Abdullah also translated for Hazmi and Mihdhar and helped them                adjust to life in San Diego Some held extremist beliefs or were well acquainted                with known extremists For example immediately after  Osama Awadallah a                Yemeni whose telephone number was found in Hazmis Toyota at Washington Dulles                International Airport was found to possess photos videos and articles relating to                Bin Ladin Awadallah also had lived in a house where copies of Bin Ladins fatwas                and other similar materials were distributed to the residents Omar Bakarbashat a                Saudi also met Hazmi and Mihdhar at the Rabat mosque He admitted helping Hazmi to                learn English and taking over the operatives first apartment in San Diego after                they moved out Bakarbashat apparently had downloaded stridently antiAmerican Web                pages to his computers hard drive                        Another potentially significant San Diego contact for Hazmi and Mihdhar was Anwar                Aulaqi an imam at the Rabat mosque Born in New Mexico and thus a US citizen                Aulaqi grew up in Yemen and studied in the United States on a Yemeni government                scholarship We do not know how or when Hazmi and Mihdhar first met Aulaqi The                operatives may even have met or at least talked to him the same day they first moved                to San Diego Hazmi and Mihdhar reportedly respected Aulaqi as a religious figure                and developed a close relationship with him                        When interviewed after  Aulaqi said he did not recognize Hazmis name but did                identify his picture Although Aulaqi admitted meeting with Hazmi several times he                claimed not to remember any specifics of what they discussed He described Hazmi as                a softspoken Saudi student who used to appear at the mosque with a companion but                who did not have a large circle of friends                        Aulaqi left San Diego in mid and by early  had relocated to Virginia As we                will discuss later Hazmi eventually showed up at Aulaqis mosque in Virginia an                appearance that may not have been coincidental We have been unable to learn enough                about Aulaqis relationship with Hazmi and Mihdhar to reach a conclusion                        In sum although the evidence is thin as to specific motivations our overall                impression is that soon after arriving in California Hazmi and Mihdhar sought out                and found a group of young and ideologically likeminded Muslims with roots in Yemen                and Saudi Arabia individuals mainly associated with Mohdar Abdullah and the Rabat                mosque The al Qaeda operatives lived openly in San Diego under their true names                listing Hazmi in the telephone directory They managed to avoid attracting much                attention            Flight Training Fails Mihdhar Bails Out            Hazmi and Mihdhar came to the United States to learn English take flying lessons                and become pilots as quickly as possible They turned out however to have no                aptitude for English Even with help and tutoring from Mohdar Abdullah and other                bilingual friends Hazmi and Mihdhars efforts to learn proved futile This lack of                language skills in turn became an insurmountable barrier to learning how to                    fly                        A pilot they consulted at one school the Sorbi Flying Club in San Diego spoke                Arabic He explained to them that their flight instruction would begin with small                planes Hazmi and Mihdhar emphasized their interest in learning to fly jets Boeing                aircraft in particular and asked where they might enroll to train on jets right                away Convinced that the two were either joking or dreaming the pilot responded                that no such school existed Other instructors who worked with Hazmi and Mihdhar                remember them as poor students who focused on learning to control the aircraft in                flight but took no interest in takeoffs or landings By the end of May  Hazmi                and Mihdhar had given up on learning how to fly                        Mihdhars mind seems to have been with his family back in Yemen as evidenced by                calls he made from the apartment telephone When news of the birth of his first                child arrived he could stand life in California no longer In late May and early                June of  he closed his bank account transferred the car registration to Hazmi                and arranged his return to Yemen According to KSM Mihdhar was bored in San Diego                and foresaw no problem in coming back to the United States since he had not                overstayed his visa Hazmi and Mohdar Abdullah accompanied him to Los Angeles on                June  After visiting the King Fahd mosque one last time with his friends Mihdhar                left the country the following day                        KSM kept in fairly close touch with his operatives using a variety of methods When                Bin Ladin called KSM back from Pakistan to Afghanistan in the spring of  KSM                asked Khallad whom we introduced in chapter  to maintain email contact with Hazmi                in the United States Mihdhars decision to strand Hazmi in San Diego enraged KSM                who had not authorized the departure and feared it would compromise the plan KSM                attempted to drop Mihdhar from the planes operation and would have done so he says                had he not been overruled by Bin Ladin                        Following Mihdhars departure Hazmi grew lonely and worried that he would have                trouble managing by himself He prayed with his housemate each morning at  AM                and attended services at the Islamic Center He borrowed his housemates computer                for Internet access following news coverage of fighting in Chechnya and Bosnia                With his housemates help Hazmi also used the Internet to search for a wife after                obtaining KSMs approval to marry This search did not succeed Although he                developed a close relationship with his housemate Hazmi preferred not to use the                house telephone continuing the practice he and Mihdhar had adopted of going outside                to make phone calls                        After Mihdhar left other students moved into the house One of these Yazeed al                Salmi stands out In July  Salmi purchased  in travelers checks at a                bank in Riyadh Saudi Arabia On September  Hazmi deposited  of the                travelers checks into his bank account after withdrawing the same amount in cash                It is possible that Hazmi was simply cashing the travelers checks for a friend We                do not know Salmi claims not to remember the transaction After  Salmi                reportedly confided to Mohdar Abdullah that he had previously known terrorist pilot                Hani Hanjour After living in the same house with Hazmi for about a month Salmi                moved to the La Mesa apartment shared by Abdullah and others                        By the fall of  Hazmi no longer even pretended to study English or take flying                lessons Aware that his coconspirators in Afghanistan and Pakistan would be sending                him a new colleague shortly he bided his time and worked for a few weeks at a gas                station in La Mesa where some of his friends including Abdullah were employed On                one occasion Hazmi told a fellow employee that he was planning to find a better                job and let slip a prediction that he would become famous                        On December   Hani Hanjour arrived in San Diego having traveled from Dubai                via Paris and Cincinnati Hazmi likely picked up Hanjour at the airport We do not                know where Hanjour stayed a few days later both men left San Diego Before                departing they visited the gas station in La Mesa where Hazmi reportedly                introduced Hanjour as a long time friend from Saudi Arabia Hazmi told his                housemate that he and his friend Hani were headed for San Jose to take flying                lessons and told his friends that he would stay in touch Hazmi promised to return                to San Diego soon and he and Hanjour drove off                        Hazmi did not sever all contact with his friends in San Diego According to Abdullah                after Hazmi left San Diego in December  he telephoned Abdullah twice in                December  or January  Hazmi said he was in San Francisco and would be                attending flight school there about two weeks later he said he was attending                flight school in Arizona Some evidence which we will discuss later indicates that                Hazmi contacted Abdullah again in August  In addition during the month                following Hazmis departure from San Diego he emailed his housemate three times                including a January  email that Hazmi signed Smer an apparent attempt to                conceal his identity that struck the housemate as strange at the time Hazmi also                telephoned his housemate that he and his friend had decided to take flight lessons                in Arizona and that Mihdhar was now back in Yemen That was their last contact                When the housemate emailed Hazmi in February and March of  to find out how he                was faring Hazmi did not reply                        The housemate who rented the room to Hazmi and Mihdhar during  is an apparently                lawabiding citizen with longstanding friendly contacts among local police and FBI                personnel He did not see anything unusual enough in the behavior of Hazmi or                Mihdhar to prompt him to report to his law enforcement contacts Nor did those                contacts ask him for information about his tenantshousemates            THE  PILOTS IN THE UNITED STATES            The Hamburg Pilots Arrive in the United States            In the early summer of  the Hamburg group arrived in the United States to begin                flight training Marwan al Shehhi came on May  arriving in Newark on a flight                from Brussels He went to New York City and waited there for Mohamed Atta to join                him On June  Atta traveled to the Czech Republic by bus from Germany and then                flew from Prague to Newark the next day According to Ramzi Binalshibh Atta did not                meet with anyone in Prague he simply believed it would contribute to operational                security to fly out of Prague rather than Hamburg the departure point for much of                his previous international travel                        Atta and Shehhi had not settled on where they would obtain their flight training In                contrast Ziad Jarrah had already arranged to attend the Florida Flight Training                Center FFTC in Venice Florida Jarrah arrived in Newark on June  and then flew                to Venice He immediately began the private pilot program at FFTC intending to get                a multiengine license Jarrah moved in with some of the flight instructors                affiliated with his school and bought a car                        While Jarrah quickly settled into training in Florida Atta and Shehhi kept searching                for a flight school After visiting the Airman Flight School in Norman Oklahoma                where Zacarias Moussaoui would enroll several months later and where another al                Qaeda operative Ihab Ali had taken lessons in the mids Atta started flight                instruction at Huffman Aviation in Venice Florida and both Atta and Shehhi                subsequently enrolled in the Accelerated Pilot Program at that school By the end of                July both of them took solo flights and by midAugust they passed the private                pilot airman test They trained through the summer at Huffman while Jarrah                continued his training at FFTC                        The Hamburg operatives paid for their flight training primarily with funds wired from                Dubai by KSMs nephew Ali Abdul Aziz Ali Between June  and September                  Ali sent Shehhi and Atta a total of  in five transfers ranging from                 to  Ali relied on the unremarkable nature of his transactions which were                essentially invisible amid the billions of dollars flowing daily across the                    globe                        Ali was not required to provide identification in sending this money and the aliases                he used were not questioned                        In midSeptember Atta and Shehhi applied to change their immigration status from                tourist to student stating their intention to study at Huffman until September                  In late September they decided to enroll at Jones Aviation in Sarasota                Florida about  miles north of Venice According to the instructor at Jones the                two were aggressive rude and sometimes even fought with him to take over the                controls during their training flights In early October they took the Stage I exam                for instruments rating at Jones Aviation and failed Very upset they said they were                in a hurry because jobs awaited them at home Atta and Shehhi then returned to                    Huffman                        In the meantime Jarrah obtained a singleengine private pilot certificate in early                August Having reached that milestone he departed on the first of five foreign                trips he would take after first entering the United States In October he flew back                to Germany to visit his girlfriend Aysel Senguen The two traveled to Paris before                Jarrah returned to Florida on October  His relationship with her remained close                throughout his time in the United States In addition to his trips Jarrah made                hundreds of phone calls to her and communicated frequently by email                        Jarrah was supposed to be joined at FFTC by Ramzi Binalshibh who even sent the                school a deposit But Binalshibh could not obtain a US visa His first                applications in May and June  were denied because he lacked established ties in                Germany ensuring his return from a trip to the United States In September he went                home to Yemen to apply for a visa from there but was denied on grounds that he also                lacked sufficient ties to Yemen In October he tried one last time in Berlin                applying for a student visa to attend aviation language school but the prior                denials were noted and this application was denied as well as incomplete                        Unable to participate directly in the operation Binalshibh instead took on the role                of coordinating between KSM and the operatives in the United States Apart from                sending a total of about  in wire transfers to Atta and Shehhi during the                summer of  one of Binalshibhs first tasks in his new role as plot coordinator                was to assist another possible pilot Zacarias Moussaoui                        In the fall of  KSM had sent Moussaoui to Malaysia for flight training but                Moussaoui did not find a school he liked He worked instead on other terrorist                schemes such as buying four tons of ammonium nitrate for bombs to be planted on                cargo planes flying to the United States When KSM found out he recalled Moussaoui                back to Pakistan and directed him to go to the United States for flight training In                early October Moussaoui went to London When Binalshibh visited London in December                he stayed at the same room dormitory where Moussaoui was still residing From                London Moussaoui sent inquiries to the Airman Flight School in Norman                    Oklahoma                        Confronting training or travel problems with Hazmi Mihdhar Binalshibh and                Moussaoui al Qaeda was looking for another possible pilot candidate A new recruit                with just the right background conveniently presented himself in Afghanistan            The Fourth Pilot Hani Hanjour            Hani Hanjour from Taif Saudi Arabia first came to the United States in  to                study at the Center for English as a Second Language at the University of Arizona                He seems to have been a rigorously observant Muslim According to his older brother                Hani Hanjour went to Afghanistan for the first time in the late s as a                teenager to participate in the jihad and because the Soviets had already                withdrawn worked for a relief agency there                        In  Hanjour returned to the United States to pursue flight training after being                rejected by a Saudi flight school He checked out flight schools in Florida                California and Arizona and he briefly started at a couple of them before returning                to Saudi Arabia In  he returned to Florida and then along with two friends                went back to Arizona and began his flight training there in earnest After about                three months Hanjour was able to obtain his private pilots license Several more                months of training yielded him a commercial pilot certificate issued by the Federal                Aviation Administration FAA in April  He then returned to Saudi Arabia                        Hanjour reportedly applied to the civil aviation school in Jeddah after returning                home but was rejected He stayed home for a while and then told his family he was                going to the United Arab Emirates to work for an airline Where Hanjour actually                traveled during this time period is unknown It is possible he went to the training                camps in Afghanistan                        The fact that Hanjour spent so much time in Arizona may be significant A number of                important al Qaeda figures attended the University of Arizona in Tucson or lived in                Tucson in the s and early s                        Some of Hanjours known Arizona associates from the time of his flight training in                the late s have also raised suspicion                        FBI investigators have speculated that al Qaeda may have directed other extremist                Muslims in the Phoenix area to enroll in aviation training It is clear that when                Hanjour lived in Arizona in the s he associated with several individuals                holding extremist beliefs who have been the subject of counterterrorism                investigations Some of them trained with Hanjour to be pilots Others had apparent                connections to al Qaeda including training in Afghanistan                        By the spring of  Hanjour was back in Afghanistan According to KSM Hanjour was                sent to him in Karachi for inclusion in the plot after Hanjour was identified in al                Qaedas al Faruq camp as a trained pilot on the basis of background information he                had provided Hanjour had been at a camp in Afghanistan for a few weeks when Bin                Ladin or Atef apparently realized that he was a trained pilot he was told to report                to KSM who then trained Hanjour for a few days in the use of code words                        On June  Hanjour returned home to Saudi Arabia He obtained a US student visa on                September  and told his family he was returning to his job in the UAE Hanjour did                go to the UAE but to meet facilitator Ali Abdul Aziz Ali                        Ali opened a bank account in Dubai for Hanjour and providing the initial funds for                his trip On December  Hanjour traveled to San Diego His supposed destination was                an English as a second language program in Oakland California which he had                scheduled before leaving Saudi Arabia but never attended Instead as mentioned                earlier he joined Nawaf al Hazmi in San Diego                        Hazmi and Hanjour left San Diego almost immediately and drove to Arizona Settling in                Mesa Hanjour began refresher training at his old school Arizona Aviation He                wanted to train on multiengine planes but had difficulties because his English was                not good enough The instructor advised him to discontinue but Hanjour said he could                not go home without completing the training In early  he started training on a                Boeing  simulator at Pan Am International Flight Academy in Mesa An instructor                there found his work well below standard and discouraged him from continuing Again                Hanjour persevered he completed the initial training by the end of March  At                that point Hanjour and Hazmi vacated their apartment and started driving east                anticipating the arrival of the muscle hijackersthe operatives who would storm                the cockpits and control the passengers By as early as April  Hanjour and Hazmi                had arrived in Falls Church Virginia                        The three pilots in Florida continued with their training Atta and Shehhi finished                up at Huffman and earned their instrument certificates from the FAA in November In                midDecember  they passed their commercial pilot tests and received their                licenses They then began training to fly large jets on a flight simulator At about                the same time Jarrah began simulator training also in Florida but at a different                center By the end of  less than six months after their arrival the three                pilots on the East Coast were simulating flights on large jets                        Travels in Early             Jarrah Atta and Shehhi having progressed in their training all took foreign trips                during the holiday period of  Jarrah flew through Germany to get home to                Beirut A few weeks later he returned to Florida via Germany with Aysel Senguen                She stayed with him in Florida for ten days even accompanying him to a flight                training session We do not know whether Atta or al Qaeda leaders knew about                Jarrahs trips and Senguens visit The other operatives had broken off regular                contact with their families At the end of January  Jarrah again flew to                Beirut to visit his sick father After staying there for several weeks Jarrah                visited Senguen in Germany for a few days before returning to the United States at                the end of February                        While Jarrah took his personal trips Atta traveled to Germany in early January                 for a progress meeting with Ramzi Binalshibh Binalshibh says Atta told him to                report to the al Qaeda leadership in Afghanistan that the three Hamburg pilots had                completed their flight training and were awaiting orders Atta also disclosed that a                fourth pilot Hanjour had joined Hazmi Upon returning to Florida Atta wired                Binalshibh travel money Binalshibh proceeded to Afghanistan made his report and                spent the next several months there and in Pakistan                        When Atta returned to Florida Shehhi left for Morocco traveling to Casablanca in                midJanuary Shehhis family concerned about not having heard from him reported                him missing to the UAE government The UAE embassy in turn contacted the Hamburg                police and a UAE representative tried to find him in Germany visiting mosques and                Shehhis last address in Hamburg After learning that his family was looking for                him Shehhi telephoned them on January  and said he was still living and studying                in Hamburg The UAE government then told the Hamburg police they could call off the                    search                        Atta and Shehhi both encountered some difficulty reentering the United States on                January  and January  respectively Because neither presented a student visa                both of them had to persuade INS inspectors that they should be admitted so that                they could continue their flight training Neither operative had any problem                clearing Customs                        After returning to Florida from their trips Atta and Shehhi visited Georgia staying                briefly in Norcross and Decatur and renting a singleengine plane to fly with an                instructor in Lawrenceville By February  Atta and Shehhi were in Virginia They                rented a mailbox in Virginia Beach cashed a check and then promptly returned to                Georgia staying in Stone Mountain We have found no explanation for these travels                In midMarch Jarrah was in Georgia as well staying in Decatur There is no                evidence that the three pilots met although Jarrah and Atta apparently spoke on the                phone At the end of the month Jarrah left the United States again and visited                Senguen in Germany for two weeks In early April Atta and Shehhi returned to                Virginia Beach and closed the mailbox they had opened in February                        By the time Atta and Shehhi returned to Virginia Beach from their travels in Georgia                Hazmi and Hanjour had also arrived in Virginia in Falls Church They made their way                to a large mosque there the Dar al Hijra mosque sometime in early April                        As we mentioned earlier one of the imams at this mosque was the same Anwar Aulaqi                with whom Hazmi had spent time at the Rabat mosque in San Diego Aulaqi had moved to                Virginia in January  He remembers Hazmi from San Diego but has denied having                any contact with Hazmi or Hanjour in Virginia                        At the Dar al Hijra mosque Hazmi and Hanjour met a Jordanian named Eyad al Rababah                Rababah says he had gone to the mosque to speak to the imam Aulaqi about finding                work At the conclusion of services which normally had  to  attendees                Rababah says he happened to meet Hazmi and Hanjour They were looking for an                apartment Rababah referred them to a friend who had one to rent Hazmi and Hanjour                moved into the apartment which was in Alexandria                        Some FBI investigators doubt Rababahs story Some agents suspect that Aulaqi may                have tasked Rababah to help Hazmi and Hanjour We share that suspicion given the                remarkable coincidence of Aulaqis prior relationship with Hazmi As noted above                the Commission was unable to locate and interview Aulaqi Rababah has been deported                to Jordan having been convicted after  in a fraudulent drivers license                    scheme                        Rababah who had lived in Connecticut New York and New Jersey told investigators                that he had recommended Paterson New Jersey as a place with an Arabicspeaking                community where Hazmi and Hanjour might want to settle They asked for his help in                getting them an apartment in Paterson Rababah tried without success He says he                then suggested that Hazmi and Hanjour travel with him to Connecticut where they                could look for a place to live                        On May  Rababah went to Hazmi and Hanjours apartment to pick them up for the trip                to Connecticut There he says he found them with new roommatesAhmed al Ghamdi and                Majed Moqed These two men had been sent to America to serve as muscle hijackers and                had arrived at Dulles Airport on May  Rababah drove Hanjour to Fairfield                Connecticut followed by Hazmi who had Moqed and Ghamdi in his car After a short                stay in Connecticut where they apparently called area flight schools and real                estate agents Rababah drove the four to Paterson to have dinner and show them                around He says that they returned with him to Fairfield that night and that he                never saw them again                        Within a few weeks Hanjour Hazmi and several other operatives moved to Paterson                and rented a oneroom apartment When their landlord later paid a visit he found                six men living thereNawaf al Hazmi now joined by his younger brother Salem                Hanjour Moqed probably Ahmed al Ghamdi and Abdul Aziz al Omari Hazmis old                friend Khalid al Mihdhar would soon join them                        Atta and Shehhi had already returned to Florida On April  they moved into an                apartment in Coral Springs Atta stayed in Florida awaiting the arrival of the                first muscle hijackers                        Shehhi on the other hand bought a ticket to Cairo and flew there from Miami on                April  We do not know much more about Shehhis reason for traveling to Egypt in                April than we know about his January trip to Morocco            Shehhi did meet with Attas father who stated in a post interview that Shehhi                just wanted to pick up Attas international drivers license and some money This                story is not credible Atta already had the license with him and presented it during                a traffic stop on April  while Shehhi was still abroad Shehhi spent about two                weeks in Egypt obviously more time than would have been needed just to meet with                Attas father Shehhi could have traveled elsewhere during this time but no records                indicating additional travel have been discovered                        Shehhi returned to Miami on May  That day Atta and Jarrah were together about                 miles to the north visiting a Department of Motor Vehicles office in Lauderdale                Lakes Florida to get Florida drivers licenses Back in Virginia Hazmi and                Hanjour were about to leave for Connecticut and New Jersey As the summer                approached the lead operatives were settled in Florida and New Jersey waiting for                the rest of their contingent to join them                        ASSEMBLING THE TEAMS            During the summer and early autumn of  Bin Ladin and senior al Qaeda leaders in                Afghanistan started selecting the muscle hijackersthe operatives who would storm                the cockpits and control the passengers Despite the phrase widely used to describe                them the socalled muscle hijackers were not at all physically imposing most were                between   and   in height                        Recruitment and Selection for             Twelve of the  muscle hijackers excluding Nawaf al Hazmi and Mihdhar came from                Saudi Arabia Satam al Suqami Wail al Shehri Waleed al Shehri Abdul Aziz al                Omari Ahmed al Ghamdi Hamza al Ghamdi Mohand al Shehri Majed Moqed Salem al                Hazmi Saeed al Ghamdi Ahmad al Haznawi and Ahmed al Nami The remaining recruit                Fayez Banihammad came from the UAE He appears to have played a unique role among                the muscle hijackers because of his work with one of the plots financial                facilitators Mustafa al Hawsawi                        Saudi authorities interviewed the relatives of these men and have briefed us on what                they found The muscle hijackers came from a variety of educational and societal                backgrounds All were between  and  years old most were unemployed with no more                than a high school education and were unmarried                        Four of themAhmed al Ghamdi Saeed al Ghamdi Hamza al Ghamdi and Ahmad al                Haznawicame from a cluster of three towns in the al Bahah region an isolated and                underdeveloped area of Saudi Arabia and shared the same tribal affiliation None                had a university degree Their travel patterns and information from family members                suggest that the four may have been in contact with each other as early as the fall                of                         Five moreWail al Shehri Waleed al Shehri Abdul Aziz al Omari Mohand al Shehri                and Ahmed al Namicame from Asir Province a poor region in southwestern Saudi                Arabia that borders Yemen this weakly policed area is sometimes called the wild                frontier Wail and Waleed al Shehri were brothers All five in this group had begun                university studies Omari had graduated with honors from high school had attained a                degree from the Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic University was married and had a                    daughter                        The three remaining muscle hijackers from Saudi Arabia were Satam al Suqami Majed                Moqed and Salem al Hazmi Suqami came from Riyadh Moqed hailed from a small town                called Annakhil west of Medina Suqami had very little education and Moqed had                dropped out of university Neither Suqami nor Moqed appears to have had ties to the                other or to any of the other operatives before getting involved with extremists                probably by                         Salem al Hazmi a younger brother of Nawaf was born in Mecca Salems family                recalled him as a quarrelsome teenager His brother Nawaf probably recommended him                for recruitment into al Qaeda One al Qaeda member who knew them says that Nawaf                pleaded with Bin Ladin to allow Salem to participate in the  operation                        Detainees have offered varying reasons for the use of so many Saudi operatives                Binalshibh argues that al Qaeda wanted to send a message to the government of Saudi                Arabia about its relationship with the United States Several other al Qaeda                figures however have stated that ethnicity generally was not a factor in the                selection of operatives unless it was important for security or operational                    reasons                        KSM for instance denies that Saudis were chosen for the  plot to drive a wedge                between the United States and Saudi Arabia and stresses practical reasons for                considering ethnic background when selecting operatives He says that so many were                Saudi because Saudis comprised the largest portion of the pool of recruits in the al                Qaeda training camps KSM estimates that in any given camp  percent of the                mujahideen were Saudi  percent were Yemeni and  percent were from elsewhere                Although Saudi and Yemeni trainees were most often willing to volunteer for suicide                operations prior to  it was easier for Saudi operatives to get into the United                    States                        Most of the Saudi muscle hijackers developed their ties to extremists two or three                years before the attacks Their families often did not consider these young men                religious zealots Some were perceived as devout others as lacking in faith For                instance although Ahmed al Ghamdi Hamza al Ghamdi and Saeed al Ghamdi attended                prayer services regularly and Omari often served as an imam at his mosque in Saudi                Arabia Suqami and Salem al Hazmi appeared unconcerned with religion and contrary                to Islamic law were known to drink alcohol                        Like many other al Qaeda operatives the Saudis who eventually became the muscle                hijackers were targeted for recruitment outside Afghanistan probably in Saudi                Arabia itself Al Qaeda recruiters certain clerics andin a few casesfamily                members probably all played a role in spotting potential candidates Several of the                muscle hijackers seem to have been recruited through contacts at local universities                and mosques                        According to the head of one of the training camps in Afghanistan some were chosen                by unnamed Saudi sheikhs who had contacts with al Qaeda Omari for example is                believed to have been a student of a radical Saudi cleric named Sulayman al Alwan                His mosque which is located in al Qassim Province is known among more moderate                clerics as a terrorist factory The province is at the very heart of the strict                Wahhabi movement in Saudi Arabia Saeed al Ghamdi and Mohand al Shehri also spent                time in al Qassim both breaking with their families According to his father                Mohand al Shehris frequent visits to this area resulted in his failing exams at his                university in Riyadh Saeed al Ghamdi transferred to a university in al Qassim but                he soon stopped talking to his family and dropped out of school without informing                    them                        The majority of these Saudi recruits began to break with their families in late                 and early  According to relatives some recruits began to make arrangements for                extended absences Others exhibited marked changes in behavior before disappearing                Salem al Hazmis father recounted that Salem who had had problems with alcohol and                petty theftstopped drinking and started attending mosque regularly three months                before he disappeared                        Several family members remembered that their relatives had expressed a desire to                participate in jihad particularly in Chechnya None had mentioned going to                Afghanistan These statements might be true or cover stories The four recruits from                the al Ghamdi tribe for example all told their families that they were going to                Chechnya Only twoAhmed al Ghamdi and Saeed al Ghamdihad documentation suggesting                travel to a Russian republic                        Some aspiring Saudi mujahideen intending to go to Chechnya encountered difficulties                along the way and diverted to Afghanistan In  Ibn al Khattabthe primary                commander of Arab nationals in Chechnyareportedly had started turning away most                foreign mujahideen because of their inexperience and inability to adjust to the                local conditions KSM states that several of the  muscle hijackers faced                problems traveling to Chechnya and so went to Afghanistan where they were drawn                into al Qaeda                        Khallad has offered a more detailed story of how such diversions occurred According                to him a number of Saudi mujahideen who tried to go to Chechnya in  to fight                the Russians were stopped at the TurkishGeorgian border Upon arriving inTurkey                they received phone calls at guesthouses in places such as Istanbul and Ankara                informing them that the route to Chechnya via Georgia had been closed These Saudis                then decided to travel to Afghanistan where they could train and wait to make                another attempt to enter Chechnya during the summer of  While training at al                Qaeda camps a dozen of them heard Bin Ladins speeches volunteered to become                suicide operatives and eventually were selected as muscle hijackers for the planes                operation Khallad says he met a number of them at the Kandahar airport where they                were helping to provide extra security He encouraged Bin Ladin to use them Khallad                claims to have been closest with Saeed al Ghamdi whom he convinced to become a                martyr and whom he asked to recruit a friend Ahmed al Ghamdi to the same cause                Although Khallad claims not to recall everyone from this group who was later chosen                for the  operation he says they also included Suqami Waleed and Wail al                Shehri Omari Nami Hamza al Ghamdi Salem al Hazmi and Moqed                        According to KSM operatives volunteered for suicide operations and for the most                part were not pressured to martyr themselves Upon arriving in Afghanistan a                recruit would fill out an application with standard questions such as What brought                you to Afghanistan How did you travel here How did you hear about us What                attracted you to the cause What is your educational background Where have you                worked before Applications were valuable for determining the potential of new                arrivals for filtering out potential spies from among them and for identifying                recruits with special skills For instance as pointed out earlier Hani Hanjour                noted his pilot training Prospective operatives also were asked whether they were                prepared to serve as suicide operatives those who answered in the affirmative were                interviewed by senior al Qaeda lieutenant Muhammad Atef                        KSM claims that the most important quality for any al Qaeda operative was willingness                to martyr himself Khallad agrees and claims that this criterion had preeminence in                selecting the planes operation participants The second most important criterion was                demonstrable patience Khallad says because the planning for such attacks could                take years                        Khallad claims it did not matter whether the hijackers had fought in jihad                previously since he believes that US authorities were not looking for such                operatives before  But KSM asserts that young mujahideen with clean records                were chosen to avoid raising alerts during travel The al Qaeda training camp head                mentioned above adds that operatives with no prior involvement in activities likely                to be known to international security agencies were purposefully selected for the                 attacks                        Most of the muscle hijackers first underwent basic training similar to that given                other al Qaeda recruits This included training in firearms heavy weapons                explosives and topography Recruits learned discipline and military life They were                subjected to artificial stresses to measure their psychological fitness and                commitment to jihad At least seven of the Saudi muscle hijackers took this basic                training regime at the al Faruq camp near Kandahar This particular camp appears to                have been the preferred location for vetting and training the potential muscle                hijackers because of its proximity to Bin Ladin and senior al Qaeda leadership Two                othersSuqami and Moqedtrained at Khaldan another large basic training facility                located near Kabul where Mihdhar had trained in the mids                        By the time operatives for the planes operation were picked in mid some of them                had been training in Afghanistan for months others were just arriving for the first                time and still others may have been returning after prior visits to the camps                According to KSM Bin Ladin would travel to the camps to deliver lectures and meet                the trainees personally If Bin Ladin believed a trainee held promise for a special                operation that trainee would be invited to the al Qaeda leaders compound at Tarnak                Farms for further meetings                        KSM claims that Bin Ladin could assess new trainees very quickly in about ten                minutes and that many of the  hijackers were selected in this manner Bin                Ladin assisted by Atef personally chose all the future muscle hijackers for the                planes operation primarily between the summer of  and April  Upon choosing                a trainee Bin Ladin would ask him to swear loyalty for a suicide operation After                the selection and oathswearing the operative would be sent to KSM for training and                the filming of a martyrdom video a function KSM supervised as head of al Qaedas                media committee                        KSM sent the muscle hijacker recruits on to Saudi Arabia to obtain US visas He                gave them money about  each and instructed them to return to Afghanistan for                more training after obtaining the visas At this early stage the operatives were                not told details about the operation The majority of the Saudi muscle hijackers                obtained US visas in Jeddah or Riyadh between September and November of                         KSM told potential hijackers to acquire new clean passports in their home countries                before applying for a US visa This was to avoid raising suspicion about previous                travel to countries where al Qaeda operated Fourteen of the  hijackers including                nine Saudi muscle hijackers obtained new passports Some of these passports were                then likely doctored by the al Qaeda passport division in Kandahar which would add                or erase entry and exit stamps to create false trails in the passports                        In addition to the operatives who eventually participated in the  attacks as                muscle hijackers Bin Ladin apparently selected at least nine other Saudis who for                various reasons did not end up taking part in the operation Mohamed Mani Ahmad al                Kahtani Khalid Saeed Ahmad al Zahrani Ali Abd al Rahman al Faqasi al Ghamdi Saeed                al Baluchi Qutaybah al Najdi Zuhair al Thubaiti Saeed Abdullah Saeed al Ghamdi                Saud al Rashid and Mushabib al Hamlan A tenth individual a Tunisian with Canadian                citizenship named Abderraouf Jdey may have been a candidate to participate in                 or he may have been a candidate for a later attack These candidate hijackers either                backed out had trouble obtaining needed travel documents or were removed from the                operation by the al Qaeda leadership Khallad believes KSM wanted between four and                six operatives per plane KSM states that al Qaeda had originally planned to use                 or  hijackers but ended up with only the                         Final Training and Deployment to the United States            Having acquired US visas in Saudi Arabia the muscle hijackers returned to                Afghanistan for special training in late  to early  The training reportedly                was conducted at the al Matar complex by Abu Turab al Jordani one of only a handful                of al Qaeda operatives who according to KSM was aware of the full details of the                planned planes operation Abu Turab taught the operatives how to conduct hijackings                disarm air marshals and handle explosives He also trained them in bodybuilding and                provided them with a few basic English words and phrases                        According to KSM Abu Turab even had the trainees butcher a sheep and a camel with a                knife to prepare to use knives during the hijackings The recruits learned to focus                on storming the cockpit at the earliest opportunity when the doors first opened and                to worry about seizing control over the rest of the plane later The operatives were                taught about other kinds of attack as well such as truck bombing so that they                would not be able to disclose the exact nature of their operation if they were                caught According to KSM the muscle did not learn the full detailsincluding the                plan to hijack planes and fly them into buildingsbefore reaching the United                    States                        After training in Afghanistan the operatives went to a safehouse maintained by KSM                in Karachi and stayed there temporarily before being deployed to the United States                via the UAE The safehouse was run by al Qaeda operative Abd al Rahim Ghulum                Rabbani also known as Abu Rahmah a close associate of KSM who assisted him for                three years by finding apartments and lending logistical support to operatives KSM                would send            According to an al Qaeda facilitator operatives were brought to the safehouse by a                trusted Pakistani al Qaeda courier named Abdullah Sindhi who also worked for KSM                The future hijackers usually arrived in groups of two or three staying at the safe                house for as long as two weeks The facilitator has identified each operative whom                he assisted at KSMs direction in the spring of  Before the operatives left                Pakistan each of them received  from KSM for future expenses                        From Pakistan the operatives transited through the UAE en route to the United                States In the Emirates they were assisted primarily by al Qaeda operatives Ali                Abdul Aziz Ali and Mustafa al Hawsawi Ali apparently assisted nine future hijackers                between April and June  as they came through Dubai He helped them with plane                tickets travelers checks and hotel reservations he also taught them about                everyday aspects of life in the West such as purchasing clothes and ordering food                Dubai a modern city with easy access to a major airport travel agencies hotels                and Western commercial establishments was an ideal transit point                        Ali reportedly assumed the operatives he was helping were involved in a big operation                in the United States he did not know the details                        When he asked KSM to send him an assistant KSM dispatched Hawsawi who had worked on                al Qaedas media committee in Kandahar Hawsawi helped send the last four operatives                other than Mihdhar to the United States from the UAE Hawsawi would consult with                Atta about the hijackers travel schedules to the United States and later check with                Atta to confirm that each had arrived Hawsawi told the muscle hijackers that they                would be met by Atta at the airport Hawsawi also facilitated some of the                operations financing                        The muscle hijackers began arriving in the United States in late April  In most                cases they traveled in pairs on tourist visas and entered the United States in                Orlando or Miami Florida Washington DC or New York Those arriving in Florida                were assisted by Atta and Shehhi while Hazmi and Hanjour took care of the rest By                the end of June  of the  muscle hijackers had crossed the Atlantic                        The muscle hijackers supplied an infusion of funds which they carried as a mixture                of cash and travelers checks purchased in the UAE and Saudi Arabia Seven muscle                hijackers are known to have purchased a total of nearly  in travelers checks                that were used in the United States Moreover substantial deposits into                operativesUS bank accounts immediately followed the entry of other muscle                hijackers indicating that those newcomers brought money with them as well In                addition muscle hijacker Banihammad came to the United States after opening bank                accounts in the UAE into which were deposited the equivalent of approximately                 on June   After his June  arrival in the United States Banihammad                made Visa and ATM withdrawals from his UAE accounts                        The hijackers made extensive use of banks in the United States choosing both                branches of major international banks and smaller regional banks All of the                hijackers opened accounts in their own name and used passports and other                identification documents that appeared valid on their face Contrary to numerous                published reports there is no evidence the hijackers ever used false Social                Security numbers to open any bank accounts While the hijackers were not experts on                the use of the US financial system nothing they did would have led the banks to                suspect criminal behavior let alone a terrorist plot to commit mass murder                        The last muscle hijacker to arrive was Khalid al Mihdhar As mentioned earlier he                had abandoned Hazmi in San Diego in June  and returned to his family in Yemen                Mihdhar reportedly stayed in Yemen for about a month before Khallad persuaded him to                return to Afghanistan Mihdhar complained about life in the United States He met                with KSM who remained annoyed at his decision to go AWOL But KSMs desire to drop                him from the operation yielded to Bin Ladins insistence to keep him                        By late  Mihdhar was in Mecca staying with a cousin until February  when                he went home to visit his family before returning to Afghanistan In June                 Mihdhar returned once more to Mecca to stay with his cousin for another month                Mihdhar said that Bin Ladin was planning five attacks on the United States Before                leaving Mihdhar asked his cousin to watch over his home and family because of a job                he had to do                        On July   Mihdhar left Saudi Arabia to return to the United States arriving                at John F Kennedy International Airport in New York Mihdhar gave his intended                address as the Marriott Hotel New York City but instead spent one night at another                New York hotel He then joined the group of hijackers in Paterson reuniting with                Nawaf al Hazmi after more than a year With two months remaining all  hijackers                were in the United States and ready to take the final steps toward carrying out the                    attacks                        Assistance from Hezbollah and Iran to al Qaeda            As we mentioned in chapter  while in Sudan senior managers in al Qaeda maintained                contacts with Iran and the Iraniansupported worldwide terrorist organization                Hezbollah which is based mainly in southern Lebanon and Beirut Al Qaeda members                received advice and training from Hezbollah Intelligence indicates the persistence                of contacts between Iranian security officials and senior al Qaeda figures after Bin                Ladins return to Afghanistan Khallad has said that Iran made a concerted effort to                strengthen relations with al Qaeda after the October  attack on the USS Cole                but was rebuffed because Bin Ladin did not want to alienate his supporters in Saudi                Arabia Khallad and other detainees have described the willingness of Iranian                officials to facilitate the travel of al Qaeda members through Iran on their way to                and from Afghanistan For example Iranian border inspectors would be told not to                place telltale stamps in the passports of these travelers Such arrangements were                particularly beneficial to Saudi members of al Qaeda                        Our knowledge of the international travels of the al Qaeda operatives selected for                the  operation remains fragmentary But we now have evidence suggesting that                 to  of the  Saudi muscle operatives traveled into or out of Iran between                October  and February                         In October  a senior operative of Hezbollah visited Saudi Arabia to coordinate                activities there He also planned to assist individuals in Saudi Arabia in traveling                to Iran during November A top Hezbollah commander and Saudi Hezbollah contacts were                    involved                        Also in October  two future muscle hijackers Mohand al Shehri and Hamza al                Ghamdi flew from Iran to Kuwait In November Ahmed al Ghamdi apparently flew to                Beirut travelingperhaps by coincidenceon the same flight as a senior Hezbollah                operative Also in November Salem al Hazmi apparently flew from Saudi Arabia to                    Beirut                        In midNovember we believe three of the future muscle hijackers Wail al Shehri                Waleed al Shehri and Ahmed al Nami all of whom had obtained their US visas in                late October traveled in a group from Saudi Arabia to Beirut and then onward to                Iran An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative was on the same flight that took                the future hijackers to Iran Hezbollah officials in Beirut and Iran were expecting                the arrival of a group during the same time period The travel of this group was                important enough to merit the attention of senior figures in Hezbollah                        Later in November two future muscle hijackers Satam al Suqami and Majed Moqed flew                into Iran from Bahrain In February  Khalid al Mihdhar may have taken a flight                from Syria to Iran and then traveled further within Iran to a point near the Afghan                    border                        KSM and Binalshibh have confirmed that several of the  hijackers at least eight                according to Binalshibh transited Iran on their way to or from Afghanistan taking                advantage of the Iranian practice of not stamping Saudi passports They deny any                other reason for the hijackers travel to Iran They also deny any relationship                between the hijackers and Hezbollah                        In sum there is strong evidence that Iran facilitated the transit of al Qaeda                members into and out of Afghanistan before  and that some of these were future                 hijackers There also is circumstantial evidence that senior Hezbollah                operatives were closely tracking the travel of some of these future muscle hijackers                into Iran in November  However we cannot rule out the possibility of a                remarkable coincidencethat is that Hezbollah was actually focusing on some other                group of individuals traveling from Saudi Arabia during this same time frame rather                than the future hijackers                        We have found no evidence that Iran or Hezbollah was aware of the planning for what                later became the  attack At the time of their travel through Iran the al Qaeda                operatives themselves were probably not aware of the specific details of their                future operation            After  Iran and Hezbollah wished to conceal any past evidence of cooperation                with Sunni terrorists associated with al Qaeda A senior Hezbollah official                disclaimed any Hezbollah involvement in  We believe                this topic requires further investigation by the US government            FINAL STRATEGIES AND TACTICS            Final Preparations in the United States            During the early summer of  Atta assisted by Shehhi was busy coordinating the                arrival of most of the muscle hijackers in southern Floridapicking them up at the                airport finding them places to stay and helping them settle in the United                    States                        The majority settled in Florida Some opened bank accounts acquired mailboxes and                rented cars Several also joined local gyms presumably to stay fit for the                operation Upon first arriving most stayed in hotels and motels but by mid June                they settled in shared apartments relatively close to one another and Atta                        Though these muscle hijackers did not travel much after arriving in the United                States two of them Waleed al Shehri and Satam al Suqami took unusual trips            On May  Shehri and Suqami flew from Fort Lauderdale to Freeport the Bahamas                where they had reservations at the Bahamas Princess Resort The two were turned away                by Bahamian officials on arrival however because they lacked visas they returned                to Florida that same day They likely took this trip to renew Suqamis immigration                status as Suqamis legal stay in the United States ended May                         On July  Shehri traveled alone from Fort Lauderdale to Boston He flew to San                Francisco the next day where he stayed one night before returning via Las Vegas                While this travel may have been a casing flightShehri traveled in first class on                the same type of aircraft he would help hijack on September  a Boeing  and                the trip included a layover in Las VegasShehri was neither a pilot nor a plot                leader as were the other hijackers who took surveillance flights                        The three Hamburg pilotsAtta Shehhi and Jarrahtook the first of their                crosscountry surveillance flights early in the summer Shehhi flew from New York to                Las Vegas via San Francisco in late May Jarrah flew from Baltimore to Las Vegas via                Los Angeles in early June Atta flew from Boston to Las Vegas via San Francisco at                the end of June Each traveled in first class on United Airlines For the eastwest                transcontinental leg each operative flew on the same type of aircraft he would                pilot on September  Atta and Shehhi a Boeing  Jarrah a Boeing                         Hanjour and Hazmi as noted below took similar crosscountry surveillance flights in                August            Jarrah and Hanjour also received additional training and practice flights in the                early summer A few days before departing on his crosscountry test flight Jarrah                flew from Fort Lauderdale to Philadelphia where he trained at Hortman Aviation and                asked to fly the Hudson Corridor a lowaltitude hallway along the Hudson River                that passes New York landmarks like the World Trade Center Heavy traffic in the                area can make the corridor a dangerous route for an inexperienced pilot Because                Hortman deemed Jarrah unfit to fly solo he could fly this route only with an                    instructor                        Hanjour too requested to fly the Hudson Corridor about this same time at Air Fleet                Training Systems in Teterboro New Jersey where he started receiving ground                instruction soon after settling in the area with Hazmi Hanjour flew the Hudson                Corridor but his instructor declined a second request because of what he considered                Hanjours poor piloting skills Shortly thereafter Hanjour switched to Caldwell                Flight Academy in Fairfield New Jersey where he rented small aircraft on several                occasions during June and July In one such instance on July  Hanjourlikely                accompanied by Hazmirented a plane from Caldwell and took a practice flight from                Fairfield to Gaithersburg Maryland a route that would have allowed them to fly                near Washington DC Other evidence suggests that Hanjour may even have returned to                Arizona for flight simulator training earlier in June                        There is no indication that Atta or Shehhi received any additional flight training in                June Both were likely too busy organizing the newly arrived muscle hijackers and                taking their crosscountry surveillance flights Atta moreover needed to                coordinate with his secondincommand Nawaf al Hazmi                        Although Atta and Hazmi appear to have been in Virginia at about the same time in                early April they probably did not meet then Analysis of late April communications                associated with KSM indicates that they had wanted to get together in April but                could not coordinate the meeting                        Atta and Hazmi probably first met in the United States only when Hazmi traveled                roundtrip from Newark to Miami between June  and June             After he returned to New Jersey Hazmis behavior began to closely parallel that of                the other hijackers He and Hanjour for instance soon established new bank                accounts acquired a mailbox rented cars and started visiting a gym So did the                four other hijackers who evidently were staying with them in New Jersey Several                also obtained new photo identification first in New Jersey and then at the Virginia                Department of Motor Vehicles where Hazmi and Hanjour had obtained such documents                months earlier likely with help from their Jordanian friend Rababah                        Atta probably met again with Hazmi in early July Returning from his initial                crosscountry surveillance flight Atta flew into New York Rather than return                immediately to Florida he checked into a New Jersey hotel He picked up tickets to                travel to Spain at a travel agency in Paterson on July  before departing for Fort                Lauderdale Now that the muscle hijackers had arrived he was ready to meet with                Ramzi Binalshibh for the last time                        The Meeting in Spain            After meeting with Atta in Berlin in January  Binalshibh had spent much of the                spring of  in Afghanistan and Pakistan helping move the muscle hijackers as                they passed through Karachi During the Berlin meeting the two had agreed to meet                later in the year in Kuala Lumpur to discuss the operation in person again In late                May Binalshibh reported directly to Bin Ladin at an al Qaeda facility known as                Compound Six near Kandahar                        Bin Ladin told Binalshibh to instruct Atta and the others to focus on their security                and that of the operation and to advise Atta to proceed as planned with the targets                discussed before Atta left Afghanistan in early the World Trade Center the                Pentagon the White House and the Capitol According to Binalshibh Bin Ladin said                he preferred the White House over the Capitol asking Binalshibh to confirm that                Atta understood this preference Binalshibh says Bin Ladin had given the same                message to Waleed al Shehri for conveyance to Atta earlier that spring Binalshibh                also received permission to meet Atta in Malaysia Atef provided money for the trip                which KSM would help Binalshibh arrange in Karachi                        In early June Binalshibh traveled by taxi from Kandahar to Quetta Pakistan where                al Qaeda courier Abu Rahmah took him to KSM According to Binalshibh KSM provided a                plane ticket to Malaysia and a fraudulent Saudi passport to use for the trip KSM                told him to ask Atta to select a date for the attacks Binalshibh was to return to                Germany and then inform KSM of the date KSM also gave Binalshibh the email address                of Zacarias Moussaoui for future contact Binalshibh then left for Kuala                    Lumpur                        Binalshibh contacted Atta upon arriving in Malaysia and found a change in plan Atta                could not travel because he was too busy helping the new arrivals settle in the                United States After remaining in Malaysia for approximately three weeks Binalshibh                went to Bangkok for a few days before returning to Germany He and Atta agreed to                meet later at a location to be determined                        In early July Atta called Binalshibh to suggest meeting in Madrid for reasons                Binalshibh claims not to know He says he preferred Berlin but that he and Atta                knew too many people in Germany and feared being spotted together Unable to buy a                ticket to Madrid at the height of the tourist season Binalshibh booked a seat on a                flight to Reus near Barcelona the next day Atta was already en route to Madrid                so Binalshibh phoned Shehhi in the United States to inform him of the change in                    itinerary                        Atta arrived in Madrid on July  He spent the night in a hotel and made three calls                from his room most likely to coordinate with Binalshibh The next day Atta rented                a car and drove to Reus to pick up Binalshibh the two then drove to the nearby town                of Cambrils Hotel records show Atta renting rooms in the same area until July                 when he returned his rental car in Madrid and flew back to Fort Lauderdale On July                 Binalshibh returned to Hamburg using a ticket Atta had purchased for him                earlier that day According to Binalshibh they did not meet with anyone else while                in Spain                        Binalshibh says he told Atta that Bin Ladin wanted the attacks carried out as soon as                possible Bin Ladin Binalshibh conveyed was worried about having so many                operatives in the United States Atta replied that he could not yet provide a date                because he was too busy organizing the arriving hijackers and still needed to                coordinate the timing of the flights so that the crashes would occur simultaneously                Atta said he required about five to six weeks before he could provide an attack                date Binalshibh advised Atta that Bin Ladin had directed that the other operatives                not be informed of the date until the last minute Atta was to provide Binalshibh                with advance notice of at least a week or two so that Binalshibh could travel to                Afghanistan and report the date personally to Bin Ladin                        As to targets Atta understood Bin Ladins interest in striking the White House Atta                said he thought this target too difficult but had tasked Hazmi and Hanjour to                evaluate its feasibility and was awaiting their answer Atta said that those two                operatives had rented small aircraft and flown reconnaissance flights near the                Pentagon Atta explained that Hanjour was assigned to attack the Pentagon Jarrah                the Capitol and that both Atta and Shehhi would hit the World Trade Center If any                pilot could not reach his intended target he was to crash the plane If Atta could                not strike the World Trade Center he planned to crash his aircraft directly into                the streets of New York Atta told Binalshibh that each pilot had volunteered for                his assigned target and that the assignments were subject to change                        During the Spain meeting Atta also mentioned that he had considered targeting a                nuclear facility he had seen during familiarization flights near New Yorka target                they referred to as electrical engineering According to Binalshibh the other                pilots did not like the idea They thought a nuclear target would be difficult                because the airspace around it was restricted making reconnaissance flights                impossible and increasing the likelihood that any plane would be shot down before                impact Moreover unlike the approved targets this alternative had not been                discussed with senior al Qaeda leaders and therefore did not have the requisite                blessing Nor would a nuclear facility have particular symbolic value Atta did not                ask Binalshibh to pass this idea on to Bin Ladin Atef or KSM and Binalshibh says                he did not mention it to them until after September                         Binalshibh claims that during their time in Spain he and Atta also discussed how the                hijackings would be executed Atta said he Shehhi and Jarrah had encountered no                problems carrying box cutters on crosscountry surveillance flights The best time                to storm the cockpit would be about  minutes after takeoff when the cockpit                doors typically were opened for the first time Atta did not believe they would need                any other weapons He had no firm contingency plan in case the cockpit door was                locked While he mentioned general ideas such as using a hostage or claiming to have                a bomb he was confident the cockpit doors would be opened and did not consider                breaking them down a viable idea Atta told Binalshibh he wanted to select planes                departing on long flights because they would be full of fuel and that he wanted to                hijack Boeing aircraft because he believed them easier to fly than Airbus aircraft                which he understood had an autopilot feature that did not allow them to be crashed                into the ground                        Finally Atta confirmed that the muscle hijackers had arrived in the United States                without incident They would be divided into teams according to their                Englishspeaking ability That way they could assist each other before the operation                and each team would be able to command the passengers in English According to                Binalshibh Atta complained that some of the hijackers wanted to contact their                families to say goodbye something he had forbidden Atta moreover was nervous                about his future communications with Binalshibh whom he instructed to obtain new                telephones upon returning to Germany Before Binalshibh left Spain he gave Atta                eight necklaces and eight bracelets that Atta had asked him to buy when he was                recently in Bangkok believing that if the hijackers were clean shaven and well                dressed others would think them wealthy Saudis and give them less notice                        As directed upon returning from Spain Binalshibh obtained two new phones one to                communicate with Atta and another to communicate with KSM and others such as                Zacarias Moussaoui Binalshibh soon contacted KSM and using code words reported                the results of his meeting with Atta This important exchange occurred in                    midJuly                        The conversation covered various topics For example Jarrah was to send Binalshibh                certain personal materials from the hijackers including copies of their passports                which Binalshibh in turn would pass along to KSM probably for subsequent use in al                Qaeda propaganda                        The most significant part of the midJuly conversation concerned Jarrahs troubled                relationship with Atta KSM and Binalshibh both acknowledge that Jarrah chafed under                Attas authority over him Binalshibh believes the disagreement arose in part from                Jarrahs family visits Moreover Jarrah had been on his own for most of his time in                the United States because Binalshibhs visa difficulty had prevented the two of them                from training together Jarrah thus felt excluded from the decisionmaking                Binalshibh had to act as a broker between Jarrah and Atta                        Concerned that Jarrah might withdraw from the operation at this late stage KSM                emphasized the importance of Atta and Jarrahs resolving their differences                Binalshibh claims that such concern was unwarranted and in their mid July                discussion reassured KSM that Atta and Jarrah would reconcile and be ready to move                forward in about a month after Jarrah visited his family Noting his concern and                the potential for delay KSM at one point instructed Binalshibh to send the skirts                to Sallya coded instruction to Binalshibh to send funds to Zacarias Moussaoui                While Binalshibh admits KSM did direct him to send Moussaoui money during the                midJuly conversation he denies knowing exactly why he received this                instructionthough he thought the money was being provided within the framework of                the  operation                        KSM may have instructed Binalshibh to send money to Moussaoui in order to help                prepare Moussaoui as a potential substitute pilot for Jarrah On July                  Aysel Senguen Jarrahs girlfriend purchased a oneway ticket for Jarrah from Miami                to Dusseldorf On Jarrahs previous four trips from the United States to see Senguen                and his family in Lebanon he had always traveled with a roundtrip ticket When                Jarrah departed Miami on July  Atta appears to have driven him to the airport                another unique circumstance                        Binalshibh picked up Jarrah at the airport in Dusseldorf on July  Jarrah wanted to                see Senguen as soon as possible so he and Binalshibh arranged to meet a few days                later When they did they had an emotional conversation during which Binalshibh                encouraged Jarrah to see the plan through                        While Jarrah was in Germany Binalshibh and Moussaoui were in contact to arrange for                the transfer of funds Binalshibh received two wire transfers from Hawsawi in the                UAE totaling  and within days relayed almost all of this money to Moussaoui                in two installments                        Moussaoui had been taking flight lessons at the Airman Flight School in Norman                Oklahoma since February but stopped in late May Although at that point he had only                about  hours of flight time and no solo flights to his credit Moussaoui began                making inquiries about flight materials and simulator training for Boeing s On                July  he put down a  deposit for flight simulator training at Pan Am                International Flight Academy in Eagan Minnesota and by the end of the month he                had received a simulator schedule to train from            August  through August  Moussaoui also purchased two knives and inquired of two                manufacturers of GPS equipment whether their products could be converted for                aeronautical useactivities that closely resembled those of the  hijackers                during their final preparations for the attacks                        On August  shortly after getting the money from Binalshibh Moussaoui left                Oklahoma with a friend and drove to Minnesota Three days later Moussaoui paid the                 balance owed for his flight simulator training at Pan Am in cash and began                his training His conduct however raised the suspicions of his flight instructor                It was unusual for a student with so little training to be learning to fly large                jets without any intention of obtaining a pilots license or other goal On August                 once the instructor reported his suspicion to the authorities Moussaoui was                arrested by the INS on immigration charges                        KSM denies ever considering Moussaoui for the planes operation Instead he claims                that Moussaoui was slated to participate in a second wave of attacks KSM also                states that Moussaoui had no contact with Atta and we are unaware of evidence                contradicting this assertion                        Yet KSM has also stated that by the summer of  he was too busy with the planes                operation to continue planning for any secondwave attacks Moreover he admits that                only three potential pilots were ever recruited for the alleged second wave                Moussaoui plus two others who by midsummer of  had backed out of the                    plot                        We therefore believe that the effort to push Moussaoui forward in August  lends                credence to the suspicion that he was being primed as a possible pilot in the                immediate planes operation Binalshibh says he assumed Moussaoui was to take his                place as another pilot in the  operation Recounting a post discussion with                KSM in Kandahar Binalshibh claims KSM mentioned Moussaoui as being part of the                 operation Although KSM never referred to Moussaoui by name Binalshibh understood                he was speaking of the operative to whom Binalshibh had wired money Binalshibh says                KSM did not approve of Moussaoui but believes KSM did not remove him from the                operation only because Moussaoui had been selected and assigned by Bin Ladin                    himself                        KSM did not hear about Moussaouis arrest until after September  According to                Binalshibh had Bin Ladin and KSM learned prior to  that Moussaoui had been                detained they might have canceled the operation When Binalshibh discussed                Moussaouis arrest with KSM after September  KSM congratulated himself on not                having Moussaoui contact the other operatives which would have compromised the                operation Moussaoui had been in contact with Binalshibh of course but this was                not discovered until after  As it turned out                Moussaoui was not needed to replace Jarrah By the time Moussaoui was arrested in                midAugust Jarrah had returned to the United States from his final trip to Germany                his disagreement with Atta apparently resolved The operatives began their final                preparations for the attacks                        Readying the Attacks            A week after he returned from meeting Binalshibh in Spain Atta traveled to Newark                probably to coordinate with Hazmi and give him additional funds Atta spent a few                days in the area before returning to Florida on July  The month of August was                busy as revealed by a set of contemporaneous Atta Binalshibh communications that                were recovered after September                         On August  for example Atta and Binalshibh discussed several matters such as the                best way for the operatives to purchase plane tickets and the assignment of muscle                hijackers to individual teams Atta and Binalshibh also revisited the question of                whether to target the White House They discussed targets in coded language                pretending to be students discussing various fields of study architecture                referred to the World Trade Center arts the Pentagonlaw the Capitol and                politics the White House                        Binalshibh reminded Atta that Bin Ladin wanted to target the White House Atta again                cautioned that this would be difficult When Binalshibh persisted Atta agreed to                include the White House but suggested they keep the Capitol as an alternate target                in case the White House proved too difficult Atta also suggested that the attacks                would not happen until after the first week in September when Congress                    reconvened                        Atta and Binalshibh also discussed the friend who is coming as a tourist a cryptic                reference to candidate hijacker Mohamed al Kahtani mentioned above whom Hawsawi                was sending the next day as the last one to complete the group On August                 Atta drove to the Orlando airport to meet Kahtani Upon arrival however Kahtani                was denied entry by immigration officials because he had a oneway ticket and little                money could not speak English and could not adequately explain what he intended to                do in the United States He was sent back to Dubai Hawsawi contacted KSM who told                him to help Kahtani return to Pakistan                        On August  Atta flew from Fort Lauderdale to Newark probably to coordinate with                Hazmi Two days later Ahmed al Ghamdi and Abdul Aziz al Omari who had been living                in New Jersey with Hazmi and Hanjour flew to Miamiprobably signifying that the                four hijacking teams had finally been assigned While Atta was in New Jersey he                Hazmi and Hanjour all purchased tickets for another set of surveillance flights                Like Shehhi Jarrah Atta and Waleed al Shehri before them Hazmi and Hanjour each                flew in first class on the same type of aircraft they would hijack on  a Boeing                 and on transcontinental flights that connected to Las Vegas This time                however Atta himself also flew directly to Las Vegas where all three stayed on                August  Beyond Las Vegass reputation for welcoming tourists we have seen no                credible evidence explaining why on this occasion and others the operatives flew                to or met in Las Vegas                        Through August the hijackers kept busy with their gym training and the pilots took                frequent practice flights on small rented aircraft The operatives also began to                make purchases suggesting that the planning was coming to an end In midAugust for                example they bought small knives that may actually have been used in the attacks                On August  moreover Jarrah attempted to purchase four GPS units from a pilot                shop in Miami He was able to buy only one unit which he picked up a few days later                when he also purchased three aeronautical charts                        Perhaps most significant however was the purchase of plane tickets for September                 On August  Atta again flew to Newark probably to meet with Hazmi and select                flights All  tickets were booked and purchased between August  and September                                            It therefore appears that the attack date was selected by the third week of August                This timing is confirmed by Binalshibh who claims Atta called him with the date in                midAugust According to Binalshibh Atta used a riddle to convey the date in codea                message of two branches a slash and a lollipop to nonAmericans  would be                interpreted as September  Binalshibh says he called Atta back to confirm the                date before passing it to KSM                        KSM apparently received the date from Binalshibh in a message sent through                Binalshibhs old Hamburg associate Zakariya Essabar Both Binalshibh and KSM claim                that Essabar was not privy to the meaning of the message and had no foreknowledge of                the attacks According to Binalshibh shortly after the date was chosen he advised                Essabar and another Hamburg associate Said Bahaji that if they wanted to go to                Afghanistan now was the time because it would soon become more difficult Essabar                made reservations on August  and departed Hamburg for Karachi on August  Bahaji                purchased his tickets on August  and departed Hamburg for Karachi on September                                            Binalshibh also made arrangements to leave for Pakistan during early September                before the attacks as did Ali and Hawsawi the plot facilitators in the UAE During                these final days Binalshibh and Atta kept in contact by phone email and instant                messaging Although Atta had forbidden the hijackers to contact their families he                apparently placed one last call to his own father on September  Atta also asked                Binalshibh to contact the family of one hijacker pass along goodbyes from others                and give regards to KSM Jarrah alone appears to have left a written farewella                sentimental letter to Aysel Senguen                        Hazmi however may not have been so discreet He may have telephoned his former San                Diego companion Mohdar Abdullah in late August Several bits of evidence indicate                that others in Abdullahs circle may have received word that something big would                soon happen As noted earlier Abdullahs behavior reportedly changed noticeably                Prior to September  both he and Yazeed al Salmi suddenly became intent on                proceeding with their planned marriages One witness quotes Salmi as commenting                after the  attacks I knew they were going to do something that is why I got                married Moreover as of August  Iyad Kreiwesh and other employees at the                Texaco station where Hazmi had worked suddenly were anticipating attention from law                enforcement authorities in the near future Finally according to an uncorroborated                witness account early on the morning of September  Abdullah Osama Awadallah                Omar Bakarbashat and others behaved suspiciously at the gas station According to                the witness after the group met Awadallah said it is finally going to happen as                the others celebrated by giving each other high fives                        Dissent within the al Qaeda Leadership While tactical preparations for the attack                were nearing completion the entire operation was being questioned at the top as al                Qaeda and the Taliban argued over strategy for  Our focus has naturally been on                the specifics of the planes operation But from the perspective of Bin Ladin and                Atef this operation was only one admittedly key element of their unfolding plans                for the year Living in Afghanistan interacting constantly with the Taliban the al                Qaeda leaders would never lose sight of the situation in that country Bin Ladins                consistent priority was to launch a major attack directly against the United States                He wanted the planes operation to proceed as soon as possible Mihdhar reportedly                told his cousin during the summer of  that Bin Ladin was reputed to have                remarked I will make it happen even if I do it by myself                        According to KSM Bin Ladin had been urging him to advance the date of the attacks                In  for instance KSM remembers Bin Ladin pushing him to launch the attacks                amid the controversy after thenIsraeli opposition party leader Ariel Sharons visit                to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem KSM claims Bin Ladin told him it would be enough                for the hijackers simply to down planes rather than crash them into specific                targets KSM says he resisted the pressure                        KSM claims to have faced similar pressure twice more in  According to him Bin                Ladin wanted the operation carried out on May   seven months to the day                after the Cole bombing KSM adds that the  attacks had originally been                envisioned for May  The second time he was urged to launch the attacks early                was in June or July  supposedly after Bin Ladin learned from the media that                Sharon would be visiting the White House On both occasions KSM resisted asserting                that the hijacking teams were not ready Bin Ladin pressed particularly strongly for                the latter date in two letters stressing the need to attack early The second letter                reportedly was delivered by Bin Ladins soninlaw Aws al Madani                        Other evidence corroborates KSMs account For instance Mihdhar told his cousin that                the attacks were to happen in May but were postponed twice first to July then to                September Moreover one candidate hijacker remembers a general warning being issued                in the al Qaeda camps in July or early August just like the warnings issued two                weeks before the Cole bombing and ten days before the eventual  attacks During                the midsummer alert al Qaeda members dispersed with their families security was                increased and Bin Ladin disappeared for about  days until the alert was                    canceled                        While the details of the operation were strictly compartmented by the time of the                alert word had begun to spread that an attack against the United States was coming                KSM notes that it was generally well known by the summer of  that he was                planning some kind of operation against the United States Many were even aware that                he had been preparing operatives to go to the United States leading some to                conclude that al Qaeda was planning a nearterm attack on US soil Moreover Bin                Ladin had made several remarks that summer hinting at an upcoming attack and                generating rumors throughout the worldwide jihadist community Bin Ladin routinely                told important visitors to expect significant attacks against US interests soon                and during a speech at the al Faruq camp exhorted trainees to pray for the success                of an attack involving  martyrs Others have confirmed hearing indications of an                impending attack and have verified that such news albeit without specific details                had spread across al Qaeda                        Although Bin Ladins top priority apparently was to attack the United States others                had a different view The Taliban leaders put their main emphasis on the years                military offensive against the Northern Alliance an offensive that ordinarily would                begin in the late spring or summer They certainly hoped that this years offensive                would finally finish off their old enemies driving them from Afghanistan From the                Talibans perspective an attack against the United States might be                counterproductive It might draw the Americans into the war against them just when                final victory seemed within their grasp                        There is evidence that Mullah Omar initially opposed a major al Qaeda operation                directly against the United States in  Furthermore by July with word                spreading of a coming attack a schism emerged among the senior leadership of al                Qaeda Several senior members reportedly agreed with Mullah Omar Those who                reportedly sided with Bin Ladin included Atef Sulayman Abu Ghayth and KSM But                those said to have opposed him were weighty figures in the organizationincluding                Abu Hafs the Mauritanian Sheikh Saeed al Masri and Sayf al Adl One senior al                Qaeda operative claims to recall Bin Ladin arguing that attacks against the United                States needed to be carried out immediately to support insurgency in the                Israelioccupied territories and protest the presence of US forces in Saudi                Arabia Beyond these rhetorical appeals Bin Ladin also reportedly thought an attack                against the United States would benefit al Qaeda by attracting more suicide                operatives eliciting greater donations and increasing the number of sympathizers                willing to provide logistical assistance                        Mullah Omar is reported to have opposed this course of action for ideological reasons                rather than out of fear of US retaliation He is said to have preferred for al                Qaeda to attack Jews not necessarily the United States KSM contends that Omar                faced pressure from the Pakistani government to keep al Qaeda from engaging in                operations outside Afghanistan Al Qaedas chief financial manager Sheikh Saeed                argued that al Qaeda should defer to theTalibans wishes Another source says that                Sheikh Saeed opposed the operation both out of deference to Omar and because he                feared the US response to an attack Abu Hafs the Mauritanian reportedly even                wrote Bin Ladin a message basing opposition to the attacks on the Quran                        According to KSM in late August when the operation was fully planned Bin Ladin                formally notified the al Qaeda Shura Council that a major attack against the United                States would take place in the coming weeks When some council members objected Bin                Ladin countered that Mullah Omar lacked authority to prevent al Qaeda from                conducting jihad outside Afghanistan Though most of the Shura Council reportedly                disagreed Bin Ladin persisted The attacks went forward                        The story of dissension within al Qaeda regarding the  attacks is probably                incomplete The information on which the account is based comes from sources who                were not privy to the full scope of al Qaeda andTaliban planning Bin Ladin and                Atef however probably would have known at least that                             The general Taliban offensive against the Northern Alliance would rely on al                    Qaeda military support                Another significant al Qaeda operation was making progress during the summera                    plot to assassinate the Northern Alliance leader Ahmed Shah Massoud The                    operatives disguised as journalists were in Massouds camp and prepared to                    kill him sometime in August Their appointment to see him was delayed                                        But on September  the Massoud assassination took place The delayedTaliban                offensive against the Northern Alliance was apparently coordinated to begin as soon                as he was killed and it got under way on September                         As they deliberated earlier in the year Bin Ladin and Atef would likely have                remembered that Mullah Omar was dependent on them for the Massoud assassination and                for vital support in the Taliban military operations KSM remembers Atef telling him                that al Qaeda had an agreement with the Taliban to eliminate Massoud after which                the Taliban would begin an offensive to take over Afghanistan Atef hoped Massouds                death would also appease the Taliban when the  attacks happened There are also                some scant indications that Omar may have been reconciled to the  attacks by the                time they occurred                        Moving to Departure Positions            In the days just before  the hijackers returned leftover funds to al Qaeda and                assembled in their departure cities They sent the excess funds by wire transfer to                Hawsawi in the UAE about  altogether                        The hijackers targeting American Airlines Flight  to depart from Dulles migrated                from New Jersey to Laurel Maryland about  miles from Washington DC They                stayed in a motel during the first week in September and spent time working out at a                gym On the final night before the attacks they lodged at a hotel in Herndon                Virginia close to the airport                        Further north the hijackers targeting United Airlines Flight  to depart from                Newark gathered in that city from their base in Florida on September  Just after                midnight on September  Jarrah received a speeding ticket in Maryland as he                headed north on I He joined the rest of his team at their hotel                        Atta was still busy coordinating the teams On September  he flew from Fort                Lauderdale to Baltimore presumably to meet with the Flight  team in Laurel On                September  he flew from Baltimore to Boston By then Shehhi had arrived there                and Atta was seen with him at his hotel The next day Atta picked up Omari at                another hotel and the two drove to Portland Maine for reasons that remain                unknown In the early morning hours of September  they boarded a commuter flight                to Boston to connect to American Airlines Flight  The two spent their last night                pursuing ordinary activities making ATM withdrawals eating pizza and shopping at                a convenience store Their three fellow hijackers for Flight  stayed together in a                hotel in Newton Massachusetts just outside of Boston                        Shehhi and his team targeting United Airlines Flight  from Logan Airport spent                their last hours at two Boston hotels                        The plan that started with a proposal by KSM in  had evolved to overcome numerous                obstacles Now  men waited in nondescript hotel rooms to board four flights the                next morning
