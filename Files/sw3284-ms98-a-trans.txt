                well uh and thats an idea thats been around for kicked around for a long time i dont know that its ever been seriously considered uh as far as close to passing uh any legislation or anything like that but i believe Israel does that dont they for their   uh yes i think so uh   people in the well everybody has to do  has to do something or maybe maybe theirs is in fact one year of military service for everyone but uh   yeah i dont know yeah i believe thats right   okay   and uh  and i dont know that thats really what were talking about uh   no i dont think its its necessary no i think of that it it it couldnt be military service is not that much but military used to do it but the idea that uh there are things that that do need to be done that could be done and then uh country would benefit from one year from from everybody and even out the the yeah   yeah for for kids in high school it could be in the summertime   requirement well now thats a thought yeah   uh you know um it it could even be done while theyre doing another job while theyre doing you know a job to make money   yeah     but uh  its uh you know such a grassroots idea that it it i think the family would have to be involved in it and and people would have to be convinced that   umhum   you know i i think the the basic message is that giving is better than receiving   yeah right   and thats not the kind of society we have right now   oh yeah im afraid youre right there but uh but uh anything like this it came up whether it it quickly would be significant industry in in figuring out how to get around it where   yeah there are lots and lots of volunteer programs and um   people who didnt wanna yeah   but most of those are at least at least it its my opinion that most of those involve uh adults   umhum   adults who have the time to give and and uh you know the desire   umhum   to to give   yeah   its not uh you know its not uh maybe the maybe it could uh younger people feel like its not open to them i dont know but but it should be if its not   yeah uh i suspect that the yeah that that that thats not the thing that they that they dont feel its open to them its just that they uh are more selfcentered if you will and not not considering voluntary preference   yeah it is kind of an introspective time of life but some schools some high schools  have actually started a program of like a visitation program to   yeah   uh you know areas economically uh   umhum   say less advantaged areas and uh   umhum   they they promote service on the part of the kids to to uh some of those people so at least thats a step in the right direction i guess   yeah yeah at uh now i didnt   i dont know it did i i think youre right that that thats not the not the way that the society these days is going and i i think we need to  we need to try to figure out some way to to turn that around that everybody   yeah its really its really unfortunate because  when you do i do volunteer work for  the American Lung Association   hm   and i have have done uh gone to work for American Heart and just recently for the Leukemia Society and theres theres no question that doing you know doing that kind of service you get a lot more out of it than uh than the people involved   yeah   uh its its really a gift to yourself and and thats i think thats a really a really important lesson to learn   yeah   and and and maybe thats why we have so many people in society who are not uh not really happy you know   or that could be   because if  if you concentrate all of your energies and efforts on yourself youre just kind of down the tube you know   yeah right   uh  really is better to give then to receive   yeah i agree i agree with that and uh and id id i dont know what  what what has what has set it off or what but it it it certainly seems to me that that uh uh things in in the last twenty thirty years uh things things have have definitely gone towards uh very much the concentration on self and and and loss of loss of perspective in terms
