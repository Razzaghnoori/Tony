 Background Cellulose acetate phthalate CAP is a promising microbicide candidate for prevention of infection by sexually transmitted disease STD pathogens including HIV 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 CAP inactivates HIV 1 and blocks the coreceptor binding site on the virus envelope glycoprotein gp120 while leaving the site for the primary cellular receptor CD4 accessible 8 9 Soluble CD4 sCD4 was shown to inhibit HIV 1 infection by two mechanisms reversible blockage of virus binding to receptors and irreversible inactivation of virus infectivity 10 Since CAP and sCD4 bind to distinct domains on the HIV 1 envelope it was of interest to determine whether or not these two ligands affect virus infectivity synergistically as do other combinations of anti HIV 1 drugs and sCD4 11 12 Binding of sCD4 leads to conformational changes in gp120 13 14 15 16 17 Binding of gp120 to coreceptors CXCR4 and CCR5 respectively triggers additional conformational changes in HIV 1 envelope glycoproteins 18 19 For these reasons it was of interest to determine whether a pretreatment of HIV 1 with sCD4 would affect subsequent binding of CAP to virus particles and b CAP binding to virus particles in the presence or absence of sCD4 would elicit conformational changes which could affect HIV 1 infectivity Such studies were expected to elucidate further the mechanisms involved in the antiviral virucidal activity of CAP and to contribute to the potential development of microbicides combining two or more anti HIV 1 compounds with distinct target sites Methods Reagents The following monoclonal antibodies mAbs were

Reitz respectively Inhibition of HIV 1 infection HIV 1 IIIB 100 TCID 50 in the presence or absence of graded concentrations of virus inhibitors CAP and sCD4 respectively in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 fetal bovine serum FBS were mixed with MT 2 cells 10 4cells well and placed into 96 well polystyrene plates The mixtures were incubated at 37 C overnight On the 2 ndday culture supernatants were removed from each well and fresh medium was added On the 4 thday culture supernatants were collected and tested for p24 antigen by ELISA Similar experiments were done with HIV 1 BaL 2 5 10 5virus particles except that PM1 cells 26 were used instead of MT 2 cells The inhibitory activity of CAP and sCD4 in combination against HIV 1 infection was determined as described above The CAP sCD4 weight ratios in the combinations were 10 1 and 2 1 for HIV 1 IIIB and HIV 1 BaL respectively The 50 inhibitory concentrations IC 50 and the combination index values CI were calculated as previously described 27 using a computer program CalcuSyn kindly provided by Dr T C Chou Sloan Kettering Cancer Center New York A CI value 1 indicates synergy and that of 1 indicates antagonism The compound dose reductions were calculated based on the IC 50 value for CAP and sCD4 used alone or in combination 27 To measure the virucidal activity of CAP sCD4 combinations treated and untreated purified HIV 1 IIIB 3 4 10 8virus particles unlike in the experiments described in an earlier report 8 where infectious tissue culture medium was used instead were serially diluted 2 to 256 fold in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 FBS mixed with MT 2 cells and placed into 96 well polystyrene plates Virus replication was monitored by measuring p24 antigen as described above Similar experiments were done with HIV 1

absorbance to virus dilutions of untreated viruses Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays ELISA For virus capture assays wells of 96 well polystyrene plates Immulon II Dynatech Laboratories Inc Chantilly VA were coated either with CAP 1 g well or with mAb NC 1 20 21 For coating with CAP a solution of CAP 100 l 10 g ml in 0 05 M acetate pH 6 0 was added to the wells After incubation overnight at 4 C the wells were washed and postcoated for 1 h at 20 C with bovine serum albumin BSA and gelatin 1 and 0 1 mg ml in 0 05 M acetate pH 6 0 For coating with antibodies wells were first coated with protein A G 1 g well in 0 1 M Tris buffer pH 8 8 for 2 h at 20 C followed by mAb NC 1 or normal mouse IgG control wells 1 g well diluted in phosphate buffered saline PBS for 1 h at 20 C Coating with the N36 C34 peptide complexes 0 01 to 10 M was done under conditions described for protein A G Subsequently the wells were washed and postcoated with BSA and gelatin as described above except that these proteins were dissolved in 0 14 M NaCl 0 01 M Tris pH 7 0 TS Chicken serum 10 in PBS Ch PBS was used instead in experiments with HIV 1 BaL to suppress binding of this virus to control wells The wells were washed with TS and stored at 4 C HIV 1 virus particles suspended in diluents and treated as indicated in legends to Figs 2 3 5were added to the wells for 5 h at 4 C Subsequently the wells were washed 10 with ice cold PBS or 1 50 anti p24 mAb in Ch PBS for HIV 1 BaL to minimize the contribution of p24 antigen not associated with virus particles to absorbance readings corresponding to p24 antigen released from detergent treated virus The washed wells with bound virus particles were then treated with lysis buffer 1 Nonidet P40 NP40 100 g ml BSA in PBS for 30 min at 37 C The supernatants were removed and tested for p24 antigen using ELISA kits from Beckman Coulter Inc following the manufacturer s protocol To measure the binding of biotinyl sCD4 and biotinyl gp120 in the presence and absence of sCD4 respectively to CAP the biotinylated proteins were added to CAP and control postcoated wells without CAP respectively at dilutions shown in Fig 1 The binding of these biotinylated proteins to the wells after washing with TS was determined by adding HRP streptavidin 1 g ml in TS containing 0 25 gelatin and 0 05 Tween 20 for 30 min at 37 C The wells were washed and bound HRP was detected using the test kit from Kirkegaard Perry following the manufacturer s protocol and the absorbance was read at 450 nm The sandwich ELISA for the gp41 six helix bundle was performed as described 21 Treated and control virus preparations were incubated with lysis buffer for 30 min at 20 C and then added to wells coated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the gp41 core In control experiments CAP alone 5 mg ml in lysis buffer was added to the wells After incubation at 4 C overnight binding of six helix bundles was determined from subsequent binding of mAb NC 1 which was added at 1 g ml in PBS 1 BSA 1 gelatin 100 l well for 1 h at 37 C Subsequently the wells were washed three times with PBS 0 05 Tween 20 and biotin labeled anti mouse IgG 100 l well 125 ng ml diluted in PBS containing 1 dry fat free milk was added After incubation for 1 h at 37 C the wells were washed as described above and HRP streptavidin 125 ng ml in PBS containing 10 goat serum 100 l well was added After incubation for 1 h at 37 C the wells were washed six times with PBS 0 05 Tween 20 HRP was quantitated as described above To exclude the remote possibility that mAb NC 1 reacted with CAP serial two fold dilutions 0 25 to 8 g ml of the mAb and of control mouse IgG respectively each at 16 g ml in PBS BG were added to CAP coated or CAP gp120 coated wells for 1 h at 37 C The wells were washed and bound IgG was quantitated as described above for the sandwich ELISA CAP gp120 wells were prepared by coating first with HIV 1 IIIB gp120 under conditions described above for protein A G except that the pH was 8 0 instead of 8 8 Subsequently CAP was added to the wells as described above In control experiments serial dilutions 1 200 to 1 1 600 of rabbit anti phthalate antiserum and of normal rabbit serum respectively each diluted 100 fold in PBS BG were added to the wells Bound rabbit IgG was quantitated using biotinylated goat anti rabbit IgG Shedding of gp120 from virus particles Preparations of purified HIV 1 IIIB and BaL respectively were incubated for 5 min at 37 C in the presence or absence of CAP final concentration 5 mg ml Control preparations were not exposed to 37 C Virus particles and released gp120 were separated by centrifugation as described 28 The virus containing pellets and supernatant fluids were assayed by an ELISA allowing gp120 determination in the presence of CAP Wells of polystyrene plates were coated with protein A G followed by polyclonal rabbit anti gp120 diluted 500 fold under conditions described above for virus capture assays Serial twofold dilutions in PBS BG of preparations containing gp120 were added to the wells After 4 h at 20 C the wells were washed and bound gp120 was detected by addition of biotinyl sCD4 1 g followed by HRP streptavidin as described above The amount of gp120 in the virus pellets and the supernatant fluids was calculated from calibration curves relating absorbance readings to gp120 dilutions All determinations were done in triplicate Molecular modeling Docking of CAP on the gp41core structure The acetylated and phthaloylated cellotetraose unit CTAP composed of four 1 4 linked D glucose units which is a representative part of CAP was created in Quanta 2000 29 as described before 8 CTAP was minimized by the steepest descent method followed by the adopted basis Newton Raphson ABNR method The energy difference of 0 05 Kcal mol between two successive structures during both minimization steps was used as the termination criterion The docking simulations of CTAP were performed using the DockVision program 30 on the entire surface of the gp41 core structure The X ray crystal structure of the gp41 core 1aik was retrieved from the protein databank http www rcsb org A grid box 125 125 125 was created to cover the entire gp41 core surface for CTAP to dock The default forcefield Research Potential Function was used to perform 1000 Monte Carlo runs for docking simulations Both CTAP and the gp41 core structure were kept rigid during docking Intermolecular energy criteria were used to select the lowest energy docked CTAP Electrostatic potential maps of gp120 and the gp120 CD4 complex Electrostatic potentials were calculated using a Poisson Boltzmann solver included in the GRASP program 31 All default parameters were used The electrostatic potential maps are shown on the accessible surface of gp120 and the gp120 CD4 complex Results Enhancement of CAP HIV 1 binding by CD4 Earlier studies 8 indicated that CAP binding to the envelope glycoprotein gp120 and to HIV 1 virus particles respectively did not interfere with their subsequent association with sCD4 Thus it would be expected that CAP would not inhibit the attachment of HIV 1 to target cells and would block only subsequent steps obligatory for HIV 1 infection initiated by engagement of CXCR4 and CCR5 coreceptors respectively The latter event was shown to be blocked by CAP 8 and has been considered the basis for the virus inhibitory and virus inactivating properties of CAP at neutral pH However it has not been determined whether or not occupancy of CD4 binding sites within gp120 would affect subsequent interactions with CAP To answer this question the binding of gp120 and gp120 sCD4 complexes respectively to immobilized CAP was studied Results shown in Fig 1indicated that sCD4 enhanced gp120 CAP binding Maximum enhancement was observed at sCD4 gp120 weight ratios of 0 6 Fig 1insert corresponding to a molar ratio of 1 2 32 in agreement with the observation that gp120 CD4 complexes consist of one molecule each of CD4 and gp120 16 Biotinyl sCD4 in the absence of gp120 did not bind to CAP Similarly pretreatment of HIV 1 with sCD4 resulted in subsequent increased binding of virus with CAP the effect being much more pronounced with HIV 1 BaL in comparison with HIV 1 IIIB Fig 2 Synergism between CAP and sCD4 in inhibiting HIV 1 infection Since HIV 1 can bind CAP and sCD4 simultaneously and the binding of CAP is enhanced in the presence of sCD4 it was of interest to determine whether these two ligands act on HIV 1 cooperatively resulting in synergism of their antiviral effects This indeed was observed Table 1and 2 Fig 3 CAP and sCD4 synergistically inhibited infection by HIV 1 IIIB Table 1 and HIV 1 BaL Table 2 A similar synergism was observed for virucidal activity against HIV 1 IIIB Fig 3 but only additive effects were found for HIV 1 BaL in the absence of sCD4 ED 50 for CAP 1 49 0 38 mg ml in the presence of sCD4 100 g ml which caused an 1 85 fold decrease of infectivity ED 50 1 39 0 18 mg ml for residual infectivity Treatment of HIV 1 with CAP leads to induction of gp41 six helix bundles Earlier studies 8 in which the binding of CAP treated and untreated virus with antibodies specific for distinct regions on the envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 was studied indicated that CAP had either no effect or caused decreased binding with antibodies against several peptides from gp120 but only against a single peptide 557 586 from gp41 see Discussion It was intended to expand these studies to mAb NC 1 specific for the gp41 six helix bundle 20 Results of preliminary studies indicated that CAP did not interfere with the six helix bundle formation from constituent peptides derived from near the N and C terminus of the gp41 ectodomain 20 own unpublished data Surprisingly and unlike with mAb 2F5 8 specific for the C terminal region of the gp41 ectodomain 33 CAP treatment enhanced the binding of both HIV 1 IIIB and HIV 1 BaL to mAb NC 1 reacting with gp41 six helix bundles from both HIV 1 IIIB and BaL Fig 4 suggesting the formation of these structures within virus particles as a result of CAP treatment Fig 5 Treatment with both CAP and sCD4 further enhanced the expression of the six helix bundles in the case of HIV 1 Bal Fig 5B but not in the case of HIV 1 IIIB Fig 5A sCD4 alone was less effective in enhancing the expression of the six helix bundles Treatment of neither recombinant gp160 or the gp41 C peptide with CAP resulted in generation of epitopes recognized by mAb NC 1 data not shown To exclude the remote possibility that mAb NC 1 reacted with CAP or protein bound CAP and that this rather than binding to six helix bundles would lead to results shown in Fig 5 the binding of the mAb to CAP coated wells was investigated No significant binding of mAb NC 1 and of control mouse IgG respectively to wells coated by CAP directly or to CAP bound to HIV 1 IIIB gp120 was observed On the other hand anti phthalate antibodies reacted with both forms of immobilized CAP Fig 6 These results support the conclusions from results in Fig 5 Engagement of the gp120 coreceptor binding site with a tyrosine sulfated peptide from the N terminus of the coreceptor CCR5 25 shown to inhibit infection by CCR5 dependent but not CXCR4 dependent HIV 1 isolates was sufficient to increase the expression of the gp41 six helix bundles in HIV 1 BaL virus particles Fig 7 A CCR5 control peptide the tyrosines of which were not sulfated did not have this effect Analogous experiments with HIV 1 IIIB were not performed since there are no published data concerning the biological properties of tyrosine sulfated peptides from the N terminus of CXCR4 In the experiments described above evidence for the formation of gp41 six helix bundles was obtained from capture of CAP CD4 and CCR5 S peptide treated virus particles respectively onto wells coated with mAb NC 1 This assay is equivalent to an immunoprecipitation assay with solid phase mAb NC 1 In order to provide further evidence for the induction of the gp41 six helix bundles by the distinct ligands binding to the HIV envelope the newly formed structures in virus lysates were also quantitated by a sandwich ELISA 21 The results not only unequivocally confirmed the induction of gp41 six helix bundle structures by sCD4 CAP and the S peptide from CCR5 but also provided evidence that these structures were undetectable in untreated virus particles Fig 8 CAP 0 078 to 10 mg ml in the absence of virus particles provided negative results in this assay The CCR5 peptide lacking sulfated tyrosines did not induce the six helix bundles Thus it seems likely that the detection of gp41 six helix bundles in untreated HIV 1 using the virion capture assay was due to their spontaneous formation during prolonged incubation of HIV 1 in these tests The six helix bundles were also induced by heating 10 min at 60 C HIV 1 virus particles Fig 8 In summary blocking by CAP of the coreceptor binding sites on the virus envelope glycoprotein gp120 within HIV 1 virus particles appears to induce conformational changes in gp41 leading to the formation of six helix bundle structures Shedding of gp120 from virus particles It was reported that treatment of HIV 1 gp120 gp41 envelope glycoprotein oligomers with sCD4 lead to shedding of gp120 sCD4 complexes concomitant with increased exposure of some cryptic epitopes on gp41 13 34 35 Therefore it was of interest to determine whether or not shedding of gp120 from virus particles was required for the CAP induced exposure of binding sites for mAb NC 1 on gp41 Treatment of HIV 1 IIIB and BaL with CAP did not decrease the level of virus associated gp120 in comparison with control virus preparations Table 3 The results agree with the half life of 40 h for virus associated gp120 in the course of spontaneous gp120 shedding from HIV 1 HXB3 at 37 C 36 and the small sCD4 induced release of gp120 within 5 min at 37 C 37 Thus gp120 shedding was not a prerequisite for the formation of gp41 six helix bundles Discussion Earlier studies 8 indicated that CAP treated HIV 1 particles have their coreceptor i e CXCR4 and CCR5 binding sites obstructed while sites involved in association with CD4 appeared unaffected This suggested that HIV 1 could bind CD4 and CAP at the same time independently Since association with CD4 induces conformational changes in the HIV 1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 14 16 17 it was of interest to determine a whether CD4 binding to HIV 1 would affect subsequent association of the virus with CAP and b the consequences of both CD4 and CAP binding to virus particles First it was found that pretreatment of gp120 with sCD4 enhanced subsequent binding with CAP Fig 1 This could be ascribed to conformational changes in gp120 to the concealment of surface areas with the greatest negative charge on gp120 by CD4 16 Fig 9 which could diminish the electrostatic attraction between gp120 and negatively charged CAP or to additional CAP binding sites on the CD4 portion of gp120 sCD4 complexes The binding of HIV 1 with CAP was similarly enhanced by pretreatment with sCD4 Fig 2 the effect being much more pronounced with the R5 virus HIV 1 BaL in comparison with the X4 virus HIV 1 IIIB These observations may be related to the recognized role of CD4 in inducing conformational changes in gp120 that contribute to the exposure of binding sites for CXCR4 and CCR5 16 17 38 Furthermore it seemed important to determine whether simultaneous CD4 and enhanced CAP binding to HIV 1 would result in synergistic effects for inhibition of HIV 1 infection Evidence for such synergism was indeed established Table 1and 2 Fig 3 Earlier studies 8 in which the binding of CAP treated and untreated virus to antibodies specific for distinct regions on the envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 was studied indicated that CAP caused decreased binding with antibodies against several peptides from gp120 but only with a single antibody against peptide 557 586 from gp41 for numbering of amino acid residues see our earlier publication 39 Thus there are fewer binding sites for CAP on gp41 than on gp120 Interestingly molecular docking studies revealed that phthalic and acetic acid anhydride modified cellotetratose a subunit of CAP docked to a single site on the gp41 core structure overlapping the peptide 557 586 Fig 10 This region is in the vicinity of the most prominent positively charged areas on the surface of the gp41 core which has an overall negative charge Since CAP blocks coreceptor binding sites on gp120 8 it was of interest to determine whether this blockade would lead to conformational changes in HIV 1 gp41 similar to those elicited by CD4 or coreceptor binding to gp120 The occupancy of CD4 and coreceptor binding sites by their respective ligands elicits downstream conformational changes in the envelope glycoprotein gp41 rendering it competent for fusion between virus and target cell membranes 18 19 40 41 42 43 Shedding of gp120 from virus particles is not required for subsequent membrane fusion events 44 The induction of gp41 six helix bundles detectable by mAb NC 1 by CAP in the absence of gp120 shedding is consistent with this conclusion The conformational changes lead to the formation of a coiled coil in gp41 consisting of three NH 2 terminal leucine isoleucine zipper regions each contributed by one of the three subunits of the envelope glycoprotein trimer In the presence of target cell membranes the NH 2 terminal fusion peptide is displaced in the direction of the target cell membrane into which it inserts Thus the HIV 1 envelope glycoprotein gp41 becomes an integral component of two membranes the viral membrane and the cellular membrane The outer surface of the coiled coil contains grooves into which three heptad repeat regions from the C terminal part of the gp41 ectodomain pack resulting in a stable six helix bundle 42 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 The six helix bundle structure can be detected by specific antibodies 14 20 43 55 Results presented here indicate that purified HIV 1 particles do not contain detectable six helix bundle structures Their expression is induced by CAP treatment of the virus Fig 5and 8 Prior engagement of CD4 binding sites is not required for the induction of the six helix bundles by CAP but increases their expression Fig 5and 8 The apparent cooperativity between CAP and sCD4 in induction of the gp41 six helix bundle structures may possibly be related to the observed synergism between these two ligands for inhibition of HIV 1 infection Table 1and 2 Fig 3 The hypothesis that engagement of coreceptor binding sites on gp120 by CAP leads to the expression of gp41 six helix bundle structures is supported by the finding that a tyrosine sulfated S peptide but not the non sulfated peptide from the N terminus of CCR5 25 56 57 has an effect similar to that of CAP Fig 7 The helix bundles were also induced by heating HIV 1 virus particles at 60 C in agreement with the irreversible induction of the fusogenic conformation in influenza virus hemagglutinin by heat 58 59 In summary the results presented here suggest that treatment of HIV 1 with CAP leads to conformational changes in the envelope glycoproteins ultimately resulting in the absence of target cell membranes in the formation of gp41 six helix bundles These structures are extremely stable and represent a terminal functionally inactive viral constituent 54 60 Fig 11 analogous to that of inactivated influenza virus hemagglutinin HA2 exposed to low pH in the absence of cell membranes 59 61 62 63 64 Conclusions Earlier studies describing the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the HIV 1 inhibitory effect of the candidate microbicide CAP indicated that this compound remains bound to HIV 1 impairing virus infectivity by blockade of binding sites for cellular coreceptors CXCR4 and CCR5 8 Results reported here further extend these findings and show that 1 there is synergism between sCD4 and CAP for inhibition of virus infectivity 2 CAP binding to HIV 1 leads to conformational changes in viral envelope glycoproteins resulting in the expression of functionally inert six helix bundle structures To the best of our knowledge results reported here and earlier 8 represent the most detailed study on the mechanism of action of a polymeric anti HIV 1 compound and offer new opportunities for microbicide research including the design of combined microbicides with distinct target sites on HIV 1 and acting
