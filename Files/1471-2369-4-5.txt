 Background Previously limited to case series 1 2 3 4 information on the patient characteristics and course of human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome associated nephropathy HIVAN after the onset of end stage renal disease ESRD has been reported for the national population of US ESRD patients 5 6 Substantial improvements in the survival of dialysis patients with HIV infection have been noted after 1995 6 and have been attributed to treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy HAART 7 Despite these encouraging reports the morbidity and mortality of these patients remains high compared with age matched patients with ESRD from other causes 6 Despite the improving information on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs in dialysis patients a recent report suggested that only 58 of the 62 HIV infected patients with ESRD were on antiretroviral therapy 8 Use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ACE in patients with HIVAN is associated with delayed progression to ESRD 9 10 Some other reports have suggested that use of ACE in dialysis patients may improve survival 11 It is possible the use of ACE might be particularly beneficial in HIV infected patients with ESRD particularly those with HIV associated nephropathy as heavy proteinuria often continues after the onset of dialysis 12 Alternatively risk of hyperkalemia from ACE in patients with HIVAN due to associated tubulointerstitial inflammation and renal tubular acidosis may increase mortality 13 Although a recent single center report found no benefit of ACE in dialysis patients with HIVAN 14 it is not clear whether this represents national experience Recent anecdotal reports of remission of HIVAN with use of HAART are encouraging However the prevalence of patients with HIVAN who develop ESRD may not decrease because of improvement in survival of these patients allowing them to live long enough to reach ESRD 15 16 17 Such patients may even be more difficult to manage since the onset of HIVAN could be delayed until these patients develop resistance to the therapy Therefore HIVAN is likely to continue as a major cause of ESRD in young African Americans Better understanding of factors associated with poor outcomes in patients with HIVAN and ESRD would help in improving outcomes in these patients More detailed information on the metabolic cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease specific characteristics of HIVAN patients on dialysis as well as the use and possible benefit of certain medications especially ACE and antiretroviral drugs in this population would supplement previous reports Further use of a national database would allow the comparison of HIVAN patients in a large at risk population and allow comparison with single center studies that may reflect practices that may not be representative of the national as a whole Therefore we analyzed data from the standard analysis files of the 2000 United States Renal Data System USRDS Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality DMMS Wave 2 database The primary objective of the study was to examine whether patients with HIVAN who present to chronic dialysis had important differences in clinical and laboratory parameters compared to patients with other causes of ESRD and to assess factors associated with better survival such as laboratory parameters and medication use Methods Statistical analysis Continuous variables are presented as mean standard deviation unless otherwise specified Univariate analysis was performed with Chi Square testing for categorical variables Fisher exact test used for violations of Cochran s assumptions meaning fewer than 5 cases per cell and student s t test for continuous variables Mann Whitney test or logarithmic transformation was used for variables without a Gaussian distribution verified by visual inspection and goodness of fit tests Chi Square for linear trend Variables with borderline significance p value 0 1 in univariate analysis and those thought likely to have a clinical relationship with HIVAN were entered into the multivariate models Stepwise forward step likelihood ratio method Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to assess the association between baseline factors and HIVAN independent of other factors This method used the most computationally intensive method for calculating mean hazard ratios approximations of relative risk entering each variable into the model and removing those that were no longer significant after adjustment for all other variables Log log plots were inspected to verify the existence of proportional hazards Estimated hazard ratios HR along with corresponding 95 confidence intervals CI and p values are reported for all regression covariates The association of HIVAN with mortality was also tested by Cox regression analysis using adjusted hazard ratios AHR Hierarchically well formed models were used in the assessment of interaction terms Collinearity diagnostics were evaluated both from the output of the statistical procedures and by manual generation of models including only one of several variables with close relationships for example malnutrition body mass index and serum albumin To assess for possible confounding logistic regression was also performed to assess for significant associations with a history of HIVAN using the same covariates as for Cox Regression as above Multiple methods were used to assess goodness of fit with all variables including Nagelkerke r 2 an attempt to quantify the proportion of explained variation in the logistic regression model although values for r 2in logistic regression are much lower than for linear regression and the c statistic which is the receiver operating curve for the cumulative predicted probability of the logistic regression model 0 5 being equivalent to chance and 1 0 equivalent to 100 agreement Results A total of 4065 patients were included in the DMMS Wave 2 cohort Of these 3621 patients had valid dates for starting dialysis in 1996 From this cohort 3374 had sufficient information to calculate follow up times Thirty six of these patients had ESRD as a result of HIVAN Mean follow up was 2 19 1 14 standard deviation years Characteristics of all the patients and patients with HIVAN are summarized in Table 1 see Additional file 1 As shown in this file factors positively associated with HIV in univariate analysis included male gender African American race younger age lower body mass index decreased comorbidity in general increased rates of malnutrition and smoking lower blood pressure and cholesterol higher serum creatinine lower serum albumin bicarbonate and decreased use of aspirin and calcium channel blockers The distribution of serum PTH levels in the study population was severely skewed with a skewness of 2 49 and a kurtosis of 9 08 We elected to use non parametric tests of association the Mann Whitney test and a t test of logarithmically transformed values of PTH Although the difference in serum PTH levels between patients with HIVAN and patients with other causes of renal disease appeared large it was not significant in Mann Whitney testing p 0 34 or t tests of logarithmically transformed values of serum PTH p 0 64 Specific antiretroviral agents are also shown in this file The most common agents used in HIVAN patients were zidovudine and lamivudine Only 22 61 of patients with HIVAN received antiretroviral agents and only nine patients 25 received combination antiretroviral therapy Five patients received both zidovudine and lamivudine a combination later called Combivir TM Other combinations included one each for zidovudine zalcitabine stavudine saquinavir stavidine lamivudine and indinavir lamivudine Table 2shows factors independently associated with HIVAN in logistic regression Factors included antiretroviral therapy male gender African American race younger age lower serum albumin higher rates of malnutrition and smoking and lower use of calcium channel blockers There were no significant differences in ACE use by either HIV or HIVAN status either unadjusted or adjusted There was no significant interaction between ACE and antiretroviral therapy Patients with HIVAN had significantly lower survival compared to patients with other causes of ESRD Table 3 Figure 1 Plots of survival by ACE use are shown for HIVAN patients Figure 2 and for the entire study cohort Figure 3 In Cox Regression analysis adjusted for other factors known to be associated with mortality HIVAN was independently associated with increased risk of mortality

83 Although the risk of death of patients with HIVAN and ESRD treated with single antiretroviral drug was higher than those not taking antiretroviral agents patients on multiple antiretroviral drugs had a lower hazard ratio in adjusted analysis 0 62 95 CI 0 10 3 86 by Cox Regression however this was not statistically significant Figure 4 Among patients with HIVAN the leading causes of death were AIDS 50 missing unknown 10 7 and cardiac arrest of unknown cause 10 7 Factors independently associated with survival in HIVAN patients are shown in Table 4 The only factor independently associate with improved survival was African American race compared to all other races Discussion The present study found that only 61 of a national sample of US dialysis patients with HIVAN received antiretroviral therapy consistent with previous regional reports of 58 use of anti retroviral agents 8 suggesting that underutilization of antiretroviral in dialysis patients with HIVAN is a national problem HAART use which the present study could not directly measure is also low in dialysis patients with HIVAN at 33 according to a recent single center study 14 We found no beneficial effect of ACE on survival in HIVAN also consistent with previous studies 14 The survival of HIVAN patients on dialysis in the preset study is also consistent with previous reports 5 6 One year survival of patients with HIVAN was only 53 compared to 83 for patients with all other causes of ESRD This survival is lower than reported recently by Ahuja et al 6 in HIV infected patients starting dialysis in the United States after 1997 likely from the fact that patients included in the DMMS wave 2 were recruited in 1996 Although data on CD4 counts and viral loads were unavailable from the database the importance of which is illustrated in two reviews 19 20 HIVAN is generally a late manifestation of HIV infection 21 Therefore use of antiretroviral therapy would be expected in patients with HIVAN in the absence of definite contraindications even disregarding the previously cited reports of a possible beneficial effect of HAART on the course of HIVAN itself However in the present study only 61 of patients with HIVAN were receiving antiretroviral therapy and 41 of these were only on single antiretroviral therapy Although not statistically significant there was a trend towards better survival of patients on two antiretroviral drugs None of the patients was on more then two antiretroviral drugs This underutilization of antiretroviral therapy could be due hesitancy on the part of the infectious disease specialists and nephrologists for using these drugs due to unavailability of data on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs in patients on dialysis Providers may also be concerned about the nephrotoxicity of certain antiretroviral agents notably indinavir associated crystal induced renal failure 22 and other antiretroviral agents that require dose adjustment in renal failure 22 Urgent studies are therefore needed to understand factors responsible for this underutilization of HAART in these patients Similar underutilization of medications known to be beneficial in patients with chronic kidney disease has also been reported for cardiovascular disease 18 23 suggesting such practice may not be an isolated phenomenon However the long term tolerability and efficacy of HAART has not been studied in patients on dialysis Although a benefit of ACE use in HIV infected patients has been reported previously 9 the benefits of ACE in retarding progression of renal failure in patients with HIVAN did not translate into improvement of survival of these patients on dialysis This is in agreement with some recommendations that ACE use to be effective must start early in the course of HIVAN As the number of patients with HIVAN who were treated with ACE was small in the present cohort further prospective studies are required to validate our initial observation In comparison to patients with other causes of ESRD the patients with HIVAN included in the DMMS wave 2 study were younger the majority were African Americans and had lower serum albumin and more severe acidosis Some reports have suggested that HIV can infect parathyroid cells and these patients have low parathyroid hormone PTH and 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels 24 However this did not prevent development of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with HIVAN and ESRD The mean PTH level of the patients with HIVAN was 225 42 6 pcg L although lower was not statistically different from patients with causes of ESRD The present study has several limitations it is observational and not randomized therefore confounding might persist despite adjustment It is a random sample of all hemodialysis patients not the total population although the peritoneal dialysis population is almost fully captured Information bias could have arisen due to mistakes in coding especially for medications We did not know the duration of use of medications prior to the study start We were also unable to follow changes in variables over time Therefore we could not follow changes in blood pressure laboratory values or dialysis adequacy This most especially applied to possible changes in medication use and changes in patient dry weight These same limitations apply to other published studies using this database In addition the information on CD4 count and plasma viral load in patients with HIVAN was not available and this could be an important uncorrected confounding factor We could not assess factors associated with HIV seropositivity or AIDS due to the high percentage of patients with missing values for these variables In summary we conclude that patients with HIVAN have a lower survival compared to patients with ESRD from other causes Antiretroviral therapy is underutilized and the use of ACE does not improve survival of these patients Future prospective studies are required to determine efficacy and tolerability of HAART and ACE inhibitors in patients with HIVAN and ESRD Competing interests None declared Authors contributions KCA performed the primary data analysis and collaborated
