 Hey Teacher Leave Those Kids Alone The Chronicle of Higher Education reports that linguists have invented a computer program that understands student writing That would be a welcome advance in civilization had it not also opened a window on the corrupt bargain between students and professors when it comes to teaching basic literary skills in the first place The Intelligent Essay Assessor an Orwellian misnomer of course is based on a form of artificial intelligence called LSA latent semantic analysis explained in detail on this website In brief bear with me here the program first compares reference materials to sample essays which have been graded by a professor then compares the sample essays to student essays The students don t have to use particular keywords for the program to figure out what they re talking about it has a wide vocabulary As for grading I f an essay appears to convey the same knowledge as verifiably good essays the computer gives it a good score If a student s work looks similar to a poor essay it gets a low score Here s what the IEA catches Students who never read the assignment in the first place plagiarists people who try to beat the program by packing the essay with relevant keywords but not stringing them together in any meaningful way Here s what it doesn t catch clever turns of phrase or creative approaches to an assignment But isn t that the essence of higher education Wrong This month s issue of American Demographics reports that more students than ever don t give a fig about clever turns of phrase or creative approaches to assignments They want big financial aid packages and the assurance of a good job after graduation Once they get into the school of their choice they study less than they ever have College students want to reap what they consider to be the maximum benefits money and social status for the minimum amount of work says the study s author This suits professors just fine They ve told the Chronicle that they re grateful to have their workload lightened by a computer And why shouldn t they be They re not graded on how well they teach they re graded by the number of articles they publish in research journals Deepening the intellectual understanding of the next generation or just teaching it to compose a decent sentence seems to be the last thing on anyone s mind The University of Colorado and New Mexico State University quick to grasp that their role is to funnel students into professional schools and high income jobs not to burden them with fine points of style have already adopted the Intelligent Essay Assessor so has the Graduate Management Admission Test It won t be long before the rest of the country does too So kids it s a deal We won t teach you how to write and you won t object that you can t Judith Shulevitz
