 Background On the basis of sequence homo logy and similarity of three dimensional structures phosphoprotein phosphatases PPases have been classified into three families designated PPP PPM and PTP reviewed in 1 2 3 The PPP and PPM families are comprised of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine specific enzymes whereas the PTP family consists of phosphotyrosine specific and dual specificity enzymes 4 The major members of the PPP family are PP1 PP2A and PP2B calcineurin class of phosphatases Protein phosphatase 5 PP5 a newer member of the PPP family differs from the other Ser Thr phosphatases in that it contains regulatory and sub cellular targeting functions within a single polypeptide 5 6 7 While its catalytic core exhibits strong similarity to those of the other members of this family its N terminus consists of three tetratricopeptide repeats TPRs that are unique to the PP5 class TPR domains consist of a series of antiparallel amphipathic helices that bundle together through hydrophobic interactions to form a cradle shaped groove postulated to be involved in binding a number of proteins of regulatory importance such as heat shock protein 90 a major cellular chaperone 8 9 10 The Apicomplexan family of parasites exemplified by Plasmodia are major disease agents of humans As the causative agent of malaria Plasmodia sp alone infects about 300 million people globally and results in an annual death toll of nearly 2 million 11 Plasmodium falciparum Pf is the most virulent of all and causes fatal cerebral malaria Because of the continual emergence of drug resistant parasites throughout the world a need for a fundamental knowledge of the signaling pathways of the parasite has been recognized In the recent past this has led to the identification of a number of Plasmodium protein phosphatases some putative 12 13 others experimentally demonstrated e g 14 15 16 Most of these phosphatases resembled the classical mammalian PP1 PP2A PP2B and PP2C enzymes 12 14 16 and some were potentially novel Ser Thr phosphatases 13 15 16 In this report we describe the cloning and characterization of a novel PP5 phosphatase from Pf PfPP5 that contains an unusually long N terminal extension that contained four putative TPR motifs and played an important role in fatty acid mediated activation of the enzyme The structural and biochemical properties of PfPP5 described herein are hallmarks of the PP5 class and thus establish PfPP5 as a likely player in parasitic signal transduction and hence a potential target for antimalarial drug design Results Identification of PfPP5 cDNA and gene To identify new Ser Thr phosphatases of Pf we have recently undertaken a PCR based approach At first we made degenerate deoxyoligonuclotide primers corresponding to the conserved peptide sequences GDXHGQ and GDXVDRG of PPs 17 An approximately 120 bp PCR product obtained by using these primers with the Pf 3D7 genomic DNA as template was cloned in the pGEM T vector Promega using the T A cloning strategy Sequencing of individual clones revealed a variety of potential PPP sequences in Pf one of which was an exact match with a putative open reading frame ORF on Pf chromosome 13 in the sequence database of the Sanger Center Accession No AL049185 Comparison of the predicted primary structure of the protein clearly revealed its similarity with known members of the PP5 family including the presence of multiple TPR domains Fig 1and 2 Specific primers were then made against this ORF and the 1578 base pair gene was cloned and confirmed by sequencing The same set of primers were then used to amplify the PfPP5 cDNA sequence from a poly A enriched mRNA population of Pf strain Dd2 This sequence fully matched the genomic Sanger sequence suggesting the lack of introns in the PfPP5 gene Recombinant expression of PfPP5 To express the putative PfPP5 protein we subcloned it in the bacterial expression vector pET 15b and introduced the plasmids into E coli BL21 DE3 As shown in Fig 3 when induced with IPTG the pET 15b PfPP5 clone produced a polypeptide of approximate Mr 70 k lane 2 which is in excellent agreement with the calculated MW of 69 139 considering that pET 15b adds a His 6 tag about 2 kDa to the N terminus of the recombinant protein The presence of the His 6 tag could be confirmed by anti His antibody in immunoblot data not shown The His tagged PfPP5 was subsequently purified through standard nickel chelation chromatography Fig 3 lane 5 Using 32P labeled histone as substrate under standard assay conditions in absence of any activator the specific activity of the recombinant PfPP5 was measured to be 198 25 nmoles of 32P min mg enzyme The deletion mutant TPR PfPP5 was similarly cloned by PCR using a primer corresponding to the internal sequence and purified by nickel chelation affinity chromatography The deletion mutant starts with Met 273 as described in Fig 1 Identification of native parasitic PP5 To identify whether PfPP5 is actually expressed in the parasite cell free extracts of the asynchronous erythrocytic stage parasites were subjected to standard chromatographic procedures that had been previously optimized for human PP5 18 Studies of mammalian PP5 have revealed that the TPR domain might act as an auto inhibitory domain of the phosphatase activity and that tryptic digestion of PP5 causes loss of the TPRs and concomitant stimulation of activity 19 20 21 As described under Materials and Methods the purification was in fact monitored by assaying for a trypsin activated phosphatase with the assumption that PfPP5 may behave like mammalian PP5 in this regard 18 20 21 As mentioned the activity peaks always coincided with a 69 kDa band in parallel Western analyses of the chromatographic fractions In SDS PAGE the partially purified fraction contained a major polypeptide of the expected size 69 kDa Fig 4 lane 2 In Western blot the rabbit antibody raised against the purified recombinant protein also specifically reacted with the native polypeptide Fig 4 lanes 5 6 A similar fraction prepared from uninfected erythrocytes contained very little protein Fig 4 lane 3 and did not react with the antibody lane 7 A pre immune serum served as a negative control Fig 4 lane 9 As expected the native Pf protein was about 2 kDa smaller than the His tagged recombinant compare the native band in lanes 2 5 and 6 with the recombinant in lanes 4 and 8 Using phosphohistone as substrate the native Pf enzyme exhibited a specific activity of 210 20 nmoles of 32P per minute per mg enzyme which is comparable to that of the recombinant enzyme Together these results demonstrated the equivalence of the native and recombinant proteins and in turn confirmed the authenticity of the cDNA sequence Primary structure of PfPP5 When the predicted primary structure of PfPP5 was aligned with known PP5 sequences Fig 1 the following features were obvious First PfPP5 contained the catalytic core found in all Ser Thr phosphatases of the PPP family including the signature motifs such as GDXHGQ GDFVDRG RGNHE HGLL and SAPNYCD to name a few 22 23 Site directed mutagenesis and structural studies in PP 1 and PP have previously established the roles of specific amino acid residues in these domains in the various aspects of catalysis such as metal ion binding phosphate recognition and co ordination of water molecules 24 25 26 While the catalytic core is generally necessary and sufficient for the phosphohydrolase activity of PPP enzymes the residues outside the core play critical roles in binding accessory proteins or small molecules that modulate the catalytic activity 25 26 27 28 29 Specifically in the PP5 class the N terminus has been shown to contain three TPR motifs 5 6 7 8 the three dimensional structure of which is now also available 8 Interestingly the N terminal sequence of PfPP5 was the longest of all and seemed to contain four TPR motifs instead of three Fig 2 Thus in comparing the full sequences of the PP5s only three of the four PfPP5 TPRs were aligned with the others and the second TPR of PfPP5 was left out A detailed sequence analysis of all the PfPP5 TPRs is offered below The TPR motif is a degenerate 34 amino acid repeat that is often found in tandem arrays sometimes separated by spacer sequences 9 We propose such a 22 residue spacer between the first two TPRs of PfPP5 Fig 1 Although no single amino acid is absolutely invariant in all TPRs they do contain a largely conserved pattern of amino acid similarity in terms of size hydrophobicity and spacing 8 9 Eight amino acid residues are critically placed on the same face of their respective helices 4 8 and 11 on the first helix and 20 24 and 27 on the second 8 9 As shown in Fig 2 residues that are identical or have similar hydrophobicity are found in all four proposed TPRs of PfPP5 in the correct relative spacing Moreover secondary structure prediction suggested that each PfPP5 TPR also has the potential to form the two conserved helices A and B as marked in Fig 2 Thus all the TPRs of PfPP5 may satisfy the structural requirements of a TPR motif An approximately 34 residue stretch following the last TPR of PP5 Fig 1 shows weak similarity to a TPR motif However alpha helix prediction and structure determination have shown that it is a single long helix that extends out of the TPR domain 8 Thus this region may not represent a typical TPR and therefore is simply marked as helix in Fig 1 Auto inhibitory role of PfPP5 TPR activation by polyunsaturated fatty acids The biochemical properties further confirmed the PP5 like nature of the Pf enzyme First of all members of the PP5 class are distinguished by their profound stimulation by polyunsaturated fatty acids 19 20 21 30 As shown in Fig 5 the phosphatase activity of PfPP5 increased with increasing concentrations of arachidonic acid and oleic acid At its highest the fatty acid stimulated activity was about 3 times the basal activity and was exhibited at approximately 70 and 80 M of arachinodic and oleic acids respectively In contrast stearic acid a saturated fatty acid did not appreciably stimulate PfPP5 activity To test the role of TPR region in this activation a TPR deletion mutant of PP5 TPR PfPP5 starting at the Met 273 was expressed with an N terminal His 6 tag The recombinant protein was expressed from pET 15b clone and purified by Ni chelation chromatography Fig 3 lane 6 In SDS PAGE analysis TPR PfPP5 exhibited a Mr of approximately 40 k as expected predicted size of 37 098 for the PP5 part plus about 2 000 for the His 6 tag Interestingly the specific activity of the TPR PfPP5 enzyme was about 3 times that of the full length PfPP5 without arachidonic acid 580 35 nmoles of 32P per minute per mg enzyme Fig 5 Moreover unlike the full length enzyme TPR PfPP5 was not activated by arachidonic acid suggesting that the TPR region is required for the activation These results are reminiscent of similar studies done in other PP5 enzymes in which mutational inactivation of the TPR domain resulted in an elevated basal activity and concomitant reduced response to unsaturated fatty acids 19 Such studies led to the proposal that TPR domains regulate the PP5 catalytic region in a negative manner and that the interaction of arachidonic acid with TPR relieves this auto inhibition This was further supported by the demonstration that trypsin cleaved PP5 in the hinge sequence connecting the TPR region and catalytic domain and that such cleavage produced a highly active enzyme which was refractory to further activation by fatty acids 18 20 21 To test whether this is also true of PfPP5 we digested recombinant PfPP5 with trypsin which resulted in the production of a trypsin resistant fragment that was very similar in size to TPR PfPP5 Fig 3 lane 7 When assayed for phosphatase activity in vitro the trypsin digested PfPP5 indeed behaved like TPR PfPP5 in that it was about 3 fold more active than the full length enzyme and was not activated by arachidonic acid any further Fig 5 Together these results suggest a role of PfPP5 TPR in auto inhibition and in fatty acid mediated activation Okadaic acid sensitivity of PfPP5 The differential sensitivity of the members of the PPP family to biological toxins has been exploited as a diagnostic tool in studying these phosphatases The marine toxin okadaic acid OA in particular inhibits the PP2A class of phosphatases at sub nanomolar concentrations IC50 0 05 nM and the PP1 class in the low nanomolar range IC50 5 45 nM The SAPNYC motif of PPP enzymes is essential for OA binding and is found in all OA sensitive phosphatases including PP1 PP2A and PP5 25 27 28 and references therein This motif is also present in PfPP5 Fig 1 Phosphatases lacking this motif include the PP2B and PP2C classes which are thus highly resistant to OA PP2A contains an additional Cys residue two amino acids downstream underlined in SAPNYCYRCG believed to be important for the profound sensitivity of this class to OA 28 and this Cys is absent in PfPP5 and other PP5 enzymes Fig 1 As shown in Fig 6 OA inhibited PfPP5 in a dose dependent manner with an IC 50 of 5 1 0 2 nM This moderate OA sensitivity further establishes the identity of PfPP5 since other PP5 enzymes also exhibit an IC 50 value for OA in the 4 6 nM range 18 The TPR mutant exhibited an essentially identical IC 50 not shown supporting the notion that the TPR domains do not play a direct role in the interaction with OA PfPP5 binds Pf heat shock protein 90 hsp90 Hsp90 is a highly conserved molecular chaperone necessary for viability and for proper folding processing and function of proteins involved in several signal transduction pathways 31 32 Interestingly mammalian hsp90 has been shown to specifically interact with PP5 and this interaction may have important consequences in PP5 structure and function 33 34 An hsp90 ortholog has been described in Pf 35 but its function is currently unknown It was therefore logical for us to ask whether an interaction between PP5 and hsp90 also occurs in Pf To initiate these studies we performed a co immunoprecipitation analysis of Pf extracts in which complexes containing PP5 were first precipitated with anti PP5 antibody and the precipitate then probed with anti hsp90 antibody in Western blot Results Fig 7 show that Pfhsp90 is indeed found in complex with PfPP5 suggesting a potential role of this interaction in the mutual regulation of these two important proteins The control non immune serum did not react with either protein lane 1 and did not precipitate hsp90 lane 3 Discussion We provide biochemical and molecular evidence for a PP5 protein Ser Thr phosphatase of P falciparum that has the catalytic core of the PPP superfamily and four tetratricopeptide 34 residue repeat TPR domains Fig 1 2 We have therefore tentatively named this enzyme PfPP5 To our knowledge PfPP5 is the only TPR containing Plasmodium protein reported at this time These domains and the associated properties such as activation by unsaturated fatty acids are by far the most noteworthy features of PfPP5 Recently a PP5 phosphatase was identified in Trypanosoma 30 that contained the prototype PP5 primary structure including three TPR domains at the N terminus While mammalian PP5 is activated 10 40 fold by arachidonic acid the Trypanosoma PP5 like its Plasmodium counterpart Fig 5 was also activated only modestly about 3 fold Although the reason behind the lower activation potential is unknown at least in PfPP5 it correlates with a similar fold activation following loss of the TPR domains through either mutagenesis or proteolytic cleavage Fig 3 5 Thus it appears that the TPR domains of the primitive parasitic PP5 may be less auto inhibitory that those of their higher eukaryotic counterparts Recent mutational analysis of recombinant PP5 has identified sequences important in autoinhibition 19 Mutation of Glu 76 underlined in the human PP5 in Fig 1 whose side chain projects away from the TPR groove resulted in a 10 fold elevation of basal activity and this Glu is conserved in both Pf and Trypanosoma PP5 Fig 1 A role of the C terminal end in autoinhibition was conjectured based on the finding that mutation of Gln 495 underlined in Fig 1 elevated basal activity by 10 fold 19 This residue is also found in Pf Gln 592 although it is not conserved in a number of other PP5 sequences Fig 1 Clearly detailed mutational analysis of these domains should shed light on the mechanism of PfPP5 autoinhibition and the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids in preventing it The TPR motif was originally identified as a protein interaction module in the cell division cycle CDC proteins in yeast 36 37 but has since been shown to occur in proteins with diverse functions in a variety of species 9 The number of the TPR domains the spacing between them and their placement in the primary structure of the protein appear variable and the relative contribution of the individual TPRs in a given protein has not been studied At least four major kinds of macromolecular complexes have been identified that involve TPR domains These include complexes involved in anaphase promotion transcription repression protein import and molecular chaperoning 9 10 Yeast two hybrid analysis and in vitro interaction studies have shown that the TPR domain of PP5 interacts with the TPR domains of CDC16 and CDC27 which may be important in recruiting PP5 to the anaphase promoting complex APC and to the mitotic spindles during cell division 38 Interaction of PP5 with heat shock protein 90 a chaperone has received special attention because of its potential to regulate a variety of pathways For example PP5 is a major component of mature glucocorticoid receptor complexes of higher eukaryotes and appears to regulate glucocorticoid receptor function in vivo 34 and references therein Such observations suggest that PP5 may act as a co chaperone for hsp90 and raise the possibility that protein dephosphorylation may play an important regulatory role in protein folding 33 34 Interestingly recent studies have identified a few residues of mammalian PP5 critically important for its interaction with hsp90 34 As marked on the human PP5 TPR underlined in Fig 1 the corresponding residues are Lys 32 Lys 97 and Arg 101 It is notable that the corresponding residues are also conserved in PfPP5 TPR The availability of full length and TPR deleted recombinant PfPP5 clones will now allow us to further investigate the exact nature of the PfPP5 Pfhsp90 complexes and map the interacting PfPP5 residues through site directed mutagenesis Clearly the discovery of PfPP5 and its interaction with homologous hsp90 will open up new directions in parasitic protein gene regulation and signaling and may lead to specific drug targets Conclusions PfPP5 represents the first TPR containing protein discovered in the Apicomplexan parasites In view of the essential role of TPR domains in protein protein interaction further studies of PfPP5 and its TPR domain will shed new light on phosphatase regulation and the role of PP5 in these clinically important parasites As with mammalian PP5 PfPP5 may also play an important role in cell division through its interaction with parasitic CDC proteins Interaction between the Plasmodium PP5 and heat shock protein 90 may reflect a mutual relationship between protein phosphorylation and protein folding in this parasite The role of TPR in this interaction can be addressed through structure function analysis of the recombinant proteins Materials and methods PCR and other procedures The following oligodeoxynucleotide primers were designed against the putative PfPP5 sequence found on chromosome 13 AL049185 Plasmodium falciparum chr13_002073 ATGTTACACAACCATGATGTAGAAGAAG TAAATGTTTTGATACAAATTATGAGC These primers were used to amplify the PfPP5 gene or the cDNA using the Pf3D7 genomic DNA or Dd2 total RNA as template with PCR and RT PCR respectively The RT reaction was performed using AMV reverse transcriptase and all PCRs were performed with a 15 1 mixture of Taq Pfu polymerase The products were cloned into pGEM T and confirmed by sequencing The genomic and cDNA sequences were identical This sequence was then subcloned into the XhoI and BamHI sites of the pET 15b vector by designing similar primers but containing the respective restriction sites The TPR deletion mutant starting at Glu 274 bold in Fig 1 was also amplified in a similar manner using specific primers and then cloned Introduction of the plasmids into E coli BL21 DE3 cells containing the compatible RIG plasmid 39 induction of the proteins with IPTG and purification through Ni chelation chromatography were performed using the His Bind kit reagents and procedure Novagen Antibodies against PP5 and hsp90 were raised in rabbit and mouse respectively using standard procedures 40 Fatty acids were purchased from Sigma St Louis MO SDS PAGE and Western blot using chemiluminescence based detection were performed essentially as described 15 Immunoprecipitation of PfPP5 complexes followed by immunoblot analysis of the precipitate were carried out essentially as described 34 Growth of Plasmodiumand purification of PfPP5 P falciparum 3D7 or Dd2 was grown in human A positive erythrocytes and infected cells were harvested at about 15 parasitemia and lysed by the saponin method essentially as described 14 15 PfPP5 was partially purified using published procedures 18 In brief the parasites were resuspended in buffer A 50 mM Tris Cl pH 7 5 10 glycerol 1 mM DTT plus 20 mM NaCl 1 Triton X 100 leupeptin 1 g ml and aprotinin 1 g ml at an approximate protein concentration of 10 mg per ml The suspension was sonicated and the lysate centrifuged at 100 000 g for 30 min The supernatant called total extract was subjected to 45 60 ammonium sulfate fractionation The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer B 20 mM HEPES pH 8 5 1 mM EDTA 1 mM DTT desalted on a Sephadex G 25 column equilibrated with buffer B then subjected to sequential chromatography on a 5 ml HiTrap heparin column Pharmacia and then a 5 ml HiTrap Q column Pharmacia PP5 activity was followed during the purification by assaying trypsin stimulated pNPPase activity The fractions were further confirmed by Western blot using anti PfPP5 antibody Parasite culture was synchronized essentially as described earlier 15 Phosphatase assay Phosphatase activity against pNPP or phosphohistone substrates was determined essentially as described previously Standard assays were performed in buffer A containing 1 mM EDTA and additional activators or inhibitors were added only where mentioned Reactions were incubated at 37 C 32P labeled phosphohistone was made as described 14 15 18 When using phosphohistone as substrate reactions were carried out in 80 l followed by quantification of the liberated 32Pi by phosphomolybdate extraction assay 14 15 18 Reactions were followed with time and results were corrected by subtraction of the corresponding values from an enzyme free reaction When p nitrophenylphosphate was used as substrate at 10 mM the reaction was scaled up to 200 l and the liberated p nitrophenol was quantitated by measurement of absorbance at 415 nm 14 23 Phosphatase reactions were routinely initiated with the addition of substrate Dephosphorylation was kept to less than 10 of the total phosphorylated substrate and the reaction was linear with respect to enzyme concentration and time When using potential activators e g fatty acids or inhibitors e g okadaic acid they were added to the enzyme mixture 10 minutes prior to initiating the reaction with the addition of substrate 14
