 Movies Batman Robin Warner Bros Critics dismiss the fourth installment in the Batman series as nonsensical kitsch a wild campy costume party Janet Maslin the New York Times Director Joel Schumacher A Time to Kill a former window dresser leans heavily on high concept get ups villainess Uma Thurman sports a suit made from 450 Santa Claus wigs in the apparent hope of deflecting attention from a script that has the eerie feeling of having no beginning no middle and no end Kenneth Turan the Los Angeles Times Still his overwrought attempts to make the film fun fast editing crashingly loud sound effects end up making it a punishing ordeal Alex Ross Slate See the Batman Robin site Face Off Paramount Pictures Hong Kong director John Woo s action flick stands out as the best by far in a bad summer crop Critics ignore the absurd premise a cop John Travolta and a villain Nicolas Cage each undergoing plastic surgery to look like the other one and take unabashed delight in the movie s grandly operatic pulp David Ansen Newsweek Reviews credit Woo with giving violence balletic grace Todd McCarthy Variety as well as moral gravity Richard Corliss Time Cage and Travolta are deemed two of the most daring physically intuitive soulful performers on screen Ansen Click here for the Face Off site La Promesse New Yorker Films Veteran Belgian documentarians Luc and Jean Pierre Dardenne win acclaim for their film about a 15 year old boy s pledge to a dying Ghanaian immigrant to look after his family A minimalist marvel says the Wall Street Journal s Joe Morgenstern Reviews dwell on the directors effective hand held camera and their subtle depiction of the ordeals of immigrant life The New Republic s Stanley Kauffmann says the Dardenne brothers can join Ken Loach and Mike Leigh in the front rank of contemporary directors with social concerns Musical Ragtime Schubert Theatre Los Angeles The musical adaptation of E L Doctorow s 1975 novel about turn of the century America is crowned as an instant classic Terrence McNally and Lynn Ahrens show says Time s Richard Zoglin combines big social themes imaginative staging and emotionally involving storytelling in a way that has all but vanished from the American musical Controversy surrounds the show s producer movie theater mogul Garth Drabinsky the current mahatma of musical theatre John Lahr The New Yorker Will he restore glory to the American musical as he bankrolls other blockbusters or will his productions simply serve as a vehicle for his own ego Books The Puttermesser Papers by Cynthia Ozick Knopf Though eclipsed somewhat by Philip Roth s and Saul Bellow s new novels Cynthia Ozick s latest gets glowing reviews just the same The story of the travails of a brainy single Jewish female in New York is lauded as a wry modern fable Merle Rubin the Wall Street Journal that shows off Ozick s flair for Isaac Bashevis Singer style magical realism Praise also for Ozick s relentless skepticism about modern urban life which is said to be reminiscent of Bellow a vision that is stark and unsparing but so intelligent it remains endearing edifying a spark of light in the gloom Richard Bernstein the New York Times See

Proust s 3 000 page novel Remembrance of Things Past as a nine step self help book One chapter title How to Suffer Successfully The book they say is a witty sendup of therapeutic literature and it also serves as a seriously legitimate guide for the perplexed Benito Rakower the Washington Post Critics also recommend it as a sort of highbrow Cliff s Notes You don t need to have read Proust in order to read this book in fact once you ve read de Botton you don t need to read it at all Richard Klein Voice Literary Supplement Bright Angel Time by Martha McPhee Random House This roman clef by writer John McPhee s daughter portrays him as ridiculously irresponsible Still critics say the daughter has inherited the father s gift for fine lapidary prose and carefully controlled language Michiko Kakutani the New York Times The book wins praise largely because of its keen rendering of the self indulgent 70s What might have been a one trauma after another chronicle of loss and divorce says Walter Kirn in the New York Times Book Review becomes instead a hard and shining artifact of personal and social upheaval Reviewers also approve of the eccentric characters especially the 8 year old LSD dropping narrator Updates The New Republic s Robert Brustein says the Tony winning adaptation of A Doll s House is driven by fashionable agendas a resolutely ahistorical reinterpretation largely designed to illustrate how a powerful woman can shatter glass ceilings Also in the New Republic Robert Boyers offers some unwonted negative words for Philip Roth s American Pastoral saying the book caricatures 1960s radicalism It does not tell us what we need to know about America what a novel can tell us about the complex attitudes and allegiances of a time and a place Recent Summary
