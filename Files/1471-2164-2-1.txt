 Background Protein tyrosine phosphorylation regulates many important cellular functions including signal transduction growth differentiation cell adhesion and axon guidance The balance between protein tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activity is an integral part of this regulatory mechanism A large number of protein tyrosine phosphatases have been identified which fall into the broad categories of cytoplasmic and receptor like molecules All receptor like protein tyrosine phosphatases RPTPs contain an extracellular region a single transmembrane segment and at least one intracellular catalytic domain They have been subdivided into several classes based on the structure of their extracellular segments Figure 1 A combination of immunoglobulin like Ig domains and fibronectin type III FN III repeats in the ectodomain defines the type II class of RPTPs An additional feature of type II RPTPs is a potential proteolytic cleavage site within the membrane proximal FN III repeat Upon cleavage extracellular N terminal and predominantly intracellular membrane bound C terminal segments are generated which remain non covalently associated 1 A subset of the type II class identified previously as type IIB RPTPs 2 is characterized by the presence of an N terminal MAM domain Currently four type IIB phosphatases PTP PTP PCP 2 and RPTP have been reported The hPCP 2 3 hPTP 4 and hPTP 5 RPTPs are located on human chromosomes 1 6 and 18 respectively and hRPTP is located on chromosome 20 6 Several additional human RPTPs PTP PTP hPTP J PTPRO share very high sequence similarity 98 with PCP 2 and are likely to represent the same gene Unigene database http www ncbi nlm nih gov unigene There are in addition several murine homologues of the four human genes mPTP Genbank NM 008983 mPTP NM008984 mRPTP AF152556 mRPTP 1 and mRPTP 2 AF162856 7 mRPTPmam4 NM 021464 mPTPf D88187 and mPTP U55057 The latter two are likely to be murine homologues of hPCP 2 and mRPTPmam4 is the same gene as mRPTP RPTP is the most recently isolated member of the IIB family 6 7 Northern blot and in situ hybridization studies have shown that RPTP is largely restricted to the central nervous system 6 Within the CNS expression is developmentally regulated and in the mouse delineates a unique boundary region in the granule cell layer of the cerebellar cortex 7 Motifs in the RPTP extracellular segment MAM Ig and FN III domains are commonly found in cell adhesion molecules The two phosphatase domains in the intracellular segment suggest that RPTP like other members of the RPTP family is involved in signal transduction through protein tyrosine dephosphorylation The human RPTP gene has been mapped to chromosome 20q12 13 1 6 it is located between anchor markers D20S99 and D20S96 and is flanked by the phospholipase C gamma 1 and splicing factor SRp55 2 genes The mouse gene maps to a syntenic region at 93 cM on mouse chromosome 2 a region closely linked to Pltp and flanked by the markers D2Mit22 and D2Mit52 To date only portions of the human RPTP RPTP and PCP 2 genes have been sequenced however the region encompassing the human RPTP gene has been sequenced in its entirety Chromosome 20 sequencing group Sanger Centre but it is not as yet fully assembled and annotated The mouse chromosomal region containing the RPTP gene has been sequenced Celera Discovery System but it is also largely unassembled In this report we describe the cloning of the mouse cDNA the identification of an unusually long 3 UTR the identification of alternatively spliced exons and the genomic organization of the human and mouse RPTP genes Results and Discussion The nucleotide sequence and domain structure of human RPTP The nucleotide sequence of hRPTP cDNA predicts a 1463AA polypeptide containing at least eight domains The polypeptide is comprised of extracellular and intracellular segments The extracellular segment contains a signal peptide AA 1 25 a MAM meprin A5 neuropilin RPTPmu domain AA 32 191 an Ig like domain AA 210 266 and four FN III repeats AA 286 369 382 471 483 576 and 593 675 A potential proteolytic cleavage site is located at AA 632 635 in the fourth fibronectin repeat The transmembrane segment is located at AA 765 785 The intracellular region contains a juxtamembrane wedge region AA 888 920 and two highly conserved phosphatase domains AA 1061 1162 and 1351 1456 The 11 hallmark amino acids that define the catalytic core of the first phosphatase domain are located at AA 1104 1114 The stop codon is found after residue 1463 of the amino acid sequence Human RPTP genomic organization We have determined that the region encompassing human RPTP is contained within 10 contiguous PAC clones and 1 BAC clone dJ269M15 dJ47A22 dJ753D4 dJ914M10 bA32G22 dJ232N11 dJ3E5 dJ230I19 dJ81G23 dJ707K17 and dJ1121H13 Sanger Center chromosome 20 group Figure 2 We have ordered these clones by identifying RPTP exons within each of them The RPTP gene spans a minimum of 1 Mbp and the RPTP coding sequence is comprised of at least 33 exons several of which are alternatively spliced A prominent feature of the RPTP gene structure is the considerable variability of exon spacing Figure 2 Exons 1 19 extend over the initial 1000 kbp of the gene exons 1 10 are widely separated while exons 10 19 are more closely spaced Of particular note are introns 1 and 7 which are 300 and 200 kbp long respectively considerably longer than the next largest intron In contrast exons 20 28 and 29 32 form two tight clusters which together span approximately 60 kbp In general this pattern of exon organization appears to be characteristic of most RPTPs as it is also observed in RPTP 8 LAR 9 CD45 10 and RPTP 11 Each of these phosphatases has at least one very large intron in the 5 region of the gene This feature is not restricted to receptor like phosphatases as it is also present in a number of adhesion receptor genes including E cadherin N cadherin P cadherin N CAM deleted in colorectal cancer DCC axonin 1 and F11 discussed in 12 The exon and intron sizes and exon intron junctional sequences of the human RPTP gene are detailed in Table 6 The majority of 5 and 3 splice sites are consensus sequences There is some variation in the length of exons which range from 30 to 297 bp Approximately one third of the exons are less than 100 bp while the remaining two thirds are in the 100 300 bp range Greater variation occurs in the size of the introns which range from 725 to 303 715 bp The largest number of introns 15 falls into the 10 4to 10 5bp bin and somewhat fewer 12 fall into the 10 3to 10 4bp bin size Only 5 introns lie outside this range Three of these fall into the 10 2to 10 3bp range and two unusually long introns in the extracellular domain are over 10 5bp The RPTP extracellular segment is comprised of protein domains the borders of these modules correspond to the boundaries of exon clusters There are three possible junctional phases between exons and introns Phase 0 refers to introns with junctions between the triplet codons whereas phase 1 and 2 introns separate within the triplet after the first and second nucleotides respectively Figure 3Ashows the distribution of intron phases relative to the domain structure of RPTP Within the RPTP gene the number of phase 0 and phase 1 introns is comparable at 15 and 12 respectively In contrast there are only five phase 2 introns in the entire gene A notable feature of RPTP gene structure is that phase 1 introns appear to be preferentially associated with the extracellular segment where they flank each of the protein domain exon modules The intracellular segment is almost devoid of phase 1 introns In contrast phase 0 introns are primarily associated with the intracellular segment and are only infrequently represented in the extracellular region Recently RPTPs have been examined in sponges 13 14 the phylogenetically oldest extant metazoan Although sponges are multicellular organisms they lack the cellular cohesiveness of the higher eukaryotes When RPTPs from yeast sponge and human were aligned and rooted cladograms constructed the common early ancestor of the phosphatase domains appeared to be yeast The second phosphatase domain arose as a duplication of the first 13 The RPTP extracellular domain was acquired during the transition from single celled to multicellular organisms In RPTP the extracellular and intracellular exon modules are separated by phase 1 and phase 0 introns respectively Furthermore intracellular introns are much smaller than those in the extracellular segment Together these observations suggest that the RPTP extracellular and intracellular segments originated as separate modular proteins that evolved by exon shuffling and duplication respectively 13 15 The two segments became linked to form a functional transmembrane molecule during the transition from single to multicellular organisms Over fifty percent of the human genome is comprised of repeat sequences 16 making it the first repeat rich genome to be sequenced Analysis of these numerous segments can provide important indications of the evolutionary history of a particular region or gene Transposon derived elements form the largest category of repeats and include LINEs SINEs LTRs and DNA elements In the RPTP gene the most common of these are LINE1 7 6 and LINE2 2 0 the SINEs Alu 4 2 MIR 3 6 and THE 0 65 LTR 0 7 and the DNA elements MLT 2 5 MER 2 5 and MST 0 5 Less common elements found in the RPTP gene include Tiggers in introns 2 7 and 9 0 5 HAL in introns 2 and 7 0 28 MAD in introns 1 and 16 0 013 and U2 in intron 2 0 006 There is also a Charlie repeat in intron 7 0 005 In addition to the transposon derived repeats there is a pseudogene in intron 7 a tRNA derived repeat in intron 30 and 133 variable length nucleotide tandem repeats VNTRs microsatellites found in the gene The G C content of the RPTP gene is approximately 42 Descriptions of the above repeat elements may be found on Repbase at http www girinst org The overall percentage of the RPTP gene comprised of repeat sequences is lower by 45 than that of the entire human genome In the human genome LINEs comprise 21 of repetitive sequences SINEs 13 LTRs 8 and DNA elements 3 16 In RPTP LINEs comprise 9 6 of repetitive sequences SINEs 8 4 LTRs 0 7 and DNA elements 6 3 The significance of this deviation in RPTP from the normal range is unknown cDNA cloning and genomic structure of mouse RPTP The mouse RPTP cDNA was cloned using a combination of PCR and 5 RACE The mouse cDNA Genbank accession AF152556 encodes a 1451AA polypeptide that is 96 identical to that of the human protein and predicts an analogous domain structure Figure 3A The Celera Discovery System mouse genomic database was used to identify clones containing RPTP exons These clones were then ordered and analyzed to identify exon intron junctions Exon and intron sizes exon intron junctional sequences and intron phases of the mouse RPTP gene are shown in Table 7 In general the exon intron splice sites in the mRPTP correspond to expected GT AG intron consensus splicing sequences and the intron phases in mouse Table 7 are identical to those in the human gene Table 6 Although the two species share approximately 89 nucleotide identity overall when examined exon by exon the degree of identity varies slightly between the extracellular and intracellular segments Figure 3B The overall identity of the mouse and human extracellular and intracellular segments is 89 and 92 respectively In general there is slightly greater variance between the two species in the extracellular segment for example mouse and human exons 1 and 9 share 78 and 95 identity Within the intracellular segment mouse exon 21 is 86 identical to that of the human and exon 24 which contains the first half of the catalytic core is 96 identical Notably the alternatively spliced exons 14 16 and 22a discussed below are 100 97 and 95 identical respectively indicating a high degree of conservation between mouse and human In summary the mouse and human genes are virtually identical in terms of the number and size of exons and the exons differ only slightly with respect to the nucleotide sequence Exon intron organization of the RPTP extracellular segment MAM domain The relationship between RPTP exon organization and protein domain boundaries is shown in Figure 3Aand in Tables 6and 7 Within the extracellular segment exon 1 encodes the signal peptide and exons 2 3 and 4 encode the single N terminal MAM domain a distinguishing feature of all type IIB phosphatases Although the function of the RPTP MAM domain is unclear other type IIB phosphatases have shown homophilic binding properties When heterologously expressed in non adherent cells both RPTP and RPTP bind homophilically to induce the formation of large calcium independent aggregates 17 18 Furthermore when the RPTP MAM domain was deleted aggregation was eliminated 19 implying that the domain had a crucial role in homophilic cellular interactions The three RPTP MAM exons differ widely in size 126 bp exon 2 272 bp exon 3 and 82 bp exon 4 All MAM associated introns are in phase 1 with the exception of the second internal intron which is in phase 0 MAM domains have been identified in a variety of cell adhesion molecules We have determined the exon structure of the MAM domain in all four human RPTP IIB genes and in human zonadhesin and human enteropeptidase NCBI database The genomic organization of the MAM domain in all four IIB phosphatases is identical In all RPTP IIB proteins Genbank NM 002844 NM 002845 NM 005704 NM 007050 and in human zonadhesin Genbank AF312032 there is a MAM domain at the N terminus the genomic structure of which is highly conserved In zonadhesin there are two additional and adjacent MAM domains The genomic organization of the latter two domains differs from that of the first The single MAM domain in the human enteropeptidase gene Genbank Y19124 is more internally located than that of RPTP close to the transmembrane region It is comprised of four exons that are 150 135 89 and 125 bp in length and is unlike any of the IIB and zonadhesin MAM domains In summary all known MAM domains are located within the extracellular segment but within this region their location exon number and exon size can vary considerably The size and structure of exons comprising the most N terminal MAM domain appear to be unique Because the nucleotide sequence of the RPTP MAM domain predicts a protein similar to that found in the other type IIB RPTPs it might be expected that the RPTP MAM domain also participates in homophilic interactions as was shown for RPTP 19 Ig domain Adjacent to the MAM domain the single Ig like domain is split into two similarly sized exons 5 and 6 by one intron in phase 0 Figure 3A Introns flanking the Ig like domain are in phase 1 In the majority of genes encoding Ig like domains only one exon encodes each domain while in others such as N CAM two exons encode each domain 20 The single Ig like domain of the RPTP gene falls into the latter category suggesting a closer relationship to N CAM like molecules LAR has characteristics of both groups 9 a feature which it shares with several other genes such as perlecan 21 and DCC 22 Within the RPTP IIB family the Ig like domain appears to act in conjunction with the MAM domain to bring about homophilic cell cell interactions 23 FN III domains Following the Ig domain are four FN III repeats Figure 3A each of which begins with a highly conserved proline residue FN III domains are found in a wide range of proteins and recently have been shown to be involved in retinal axon target selection 24 As a general rule FN III domains are encoded either by 1 or 2 exons 25 Within genes that encode multiple FN III domains exon organization may be of one type or a combination of the two types For example N CAM has 2 exons for each FN III domain 26 whereas tenascin 27 and LAR 9 have a mixture of both types In the RPTP gene there is a good correlation between exon structure and FN III boundaries Figure 3A although there is some variation in the number of exons per domain Each of the first two FN III repeats is encoded by a single exon exons 7 and 8 respectively In contrast the third FN III repeat is encoded by two exons 9 and 10 Somewhat atypically the fourth FN III repeat is encoded by three exons 11 12 and 13 This domain contains a putative proteolytic cleavage site RPTP FN III repeats share high sequence similarity with those of N CAM but only the third FN III domain in RPTP is encoded by two exons In contrast to the type IIA phosphatase LAR the RPTP gene does not contain exons encoding more than one fibronectin domain however like LAR it has a FN III domain encoded by three exons In the majority of known cases the exon intron junctions corresponding to the FN III domain boundaries are in phase 1 When two exons encode a FN III domain an intron interrupts the coding region in a central relatively non conserved part of the domain and the exon intron junction may be in any phase In the RPTP gene introns separating the individual FN III repeats are in phase 1 the intron internal to the third repeat is in phase 0 and introns internal to the fourth FN III repeat are in phase 2 and 0 respectively Exon intron organization of the RPTP intracellular segment Juxtamembrane region Following the transmembrane segment exon 15 exons 16 18 encode the juxtamembrane region Figure 3A Tables 6and 7 This segment of the RPTP protein is similar to the membrane proximal region in the type IV phosphatase murine RPTP for which the crystal structure has been determined 28 RPTP exists as a dimer in which the catalytic site of one molecule is blocked by contact with a wedge from the other Specifically the turn part of the helix turn helix motif is inserted into the active site which maintains the WpD loop in the open state 28 In other phosphatases 29 the WpD loop undergoes a conformational shift upon substrate binding which appears to be crucial for catalysis Thus it is very likely that the dimeric form of RPTP is unable to bind tyrosine phosphorylated substrates rendering it catalytically inactive The negative charge of two adjacent residues within a highly conserved sequence in the juxtamembrane region appears to be crucial for inhibition 28 30 In RPTP these two residues are negatively charged aspartates In type IIB RPTPs the first residue is changed to an alanine in PCP 2 and RPTP and to a serine in RPTP The second residue is retained as either a glutamate in PCP 2 and RPTP or an aspartate in RPTP These single amino acid changes may indicate a somewhat weaker level of inhibition This is supported by the examination of the crystal structure of RPTP which shows that although a wedge is formed catalytic activity is not inhibited by its insertion into the active site on the adjacent monomer 31 However in the case of RPTP the first residue is a glycine and the second is the large basic residue glutamine Thus the RPTP juxtamembrane catalytic region is likely to have a different conformation to that of the other phosphatases and a net positive charge making the regulation of phosphatase activity by dimerization induced wedge inhibition unlikely Phosphatase domains Although the extracellular regions of receptor like phosphatases are highly variable the intracellular tandem phosphatase domains appear quite closely related The structure of the CD45 gene indicates that both protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPase domains have a very similar exon intron organization which probably arose by duplication 10 In RPTP the first and second phosphatase domains are encoded by exons 19 26 and 27 32 respectively Figure 3A The exon structure of the RPTP phosphatase domains and that of homologous domains in PCP 2 NM_005704 RPTP NM 002844 RPTP NM 002845 LAR 9 CD45 10 RPTP 11 RPTP 8 and rat Esp mOST PTP 32 33 are compared in Figure 4 We have deduced the genomic structure of RPTP RPTP and PCP 2 by comparing known cDNA sequences with human genomic clones NCBI The positions of the exon boundaries in the phosphatase domains of RPTP RPTP RPTP and PCP 2 coincide exactly and correspond well with the five other phosphatases LAR is somewhat anomalous in that although the exon intron structure of the second phosphatase domain is generally similar to that of the other RPTPs exons in the first phosphatase domain are fewer in number but greater in size The final exon in all nine genes encodes the end of the second phosphatase domain the short C terminus and the entire 3 untranslated region A striking similarity among the RPTP genes is the conservation of exon intron junction 24 25 in the first phosphatase domain In LAR CD45 and RPTP this junction interrupts the highly conserved sequence VHCSAGV part of the catalytic core of the phosphatase 34 35 Although this exon intron junction in the IIB phosphatases corresponds exactly there is a change in the last amino acid from a valine to an alanine Interestingly an exon intron junction is not observed at this position in the cytoplasmic PTPase PTP1B 36 an observation that may indicate an early evolutionary divergence of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane PTPases 37 Although the exon intron structure of the two phosphatase domains was remarkably similar in each of the nine RPTPs examined there were variations in exon size and number primarily in those close to the transmembrane domain For example the third exon 135 nt in the first phosphatase domain of rat Esp mOST PTP and RPTP is replaced by two smaller exons 37 and 98 nt in RPTP CD45 RPTP PCP 2 RPTP and RPTP Two smaller exons replace a single exon at the C terminal end of the first phosphatase domain of rat Esp mOST PTP Similarly at the start of the second phosphatase domain the first exon 174nt in RPTP PCP 2 RPTP RPTP and LAR is replaced by two smaller exons in rat Esp mOST PTP RPTP RPTP and CD45 In each case the total number of nucleotides in the two smaller exons is virtually identical to that of the single larger exon at the same position It is unclear whether these changes in exon number resulted from intron gain or exon fusion RPTP 3 untranslated region Following the second phosphatase domain there is a long 8 0 kb 3 untranslated sequence BLAST comparisons identified a region on the KIAA0283 gene Genbank accession AB006621 that showed 99 identity to nucleotides 3181 to 4437 of the hRPTP sequence Thus the 3 UTR of hRPTP which is contained in exon 32 was identified as KIAA0283 Polyadenylation signals were found at 12425 nt and 12663 nt NM_007050 Alternative splicing of mouse and human RPTP genes Comparison of the four RPTP type IIB RPTP RPTP RPTP PCP 2 nucleotide sequences predicted that at least two exons 14 and 16 are likely to be alternatively spliced In addition the presence of a segment AA 826 850 in xenopus RPTP that is absent in the majority of other type IIB RPTPs raised the possibility of an alternatively spliced exon between exons 17 and 18 Human fetal brain mouse neonatal brain and several regions cortex forebrain brainstem and cerebellum of adult C57BL 6 mouse brain were examined for the presence of alternatively spliced regions PCR primers were designed to amplify the regions encapsulating exons 14 and 16 and the region between exons 17 and 18 An additional region between exons 22 and 23 was also examined The identity of all PCR products was verified by sequencing The RPTP exon 14 primers yielded two products of 257 and 200 bp Figure 5Aand 5B indicating a 57 nt alternatively spliced region at 2177 to 2233 nt This 19AA segment is encoded by exon 14 Both splice forms were observed in human fetal and in neonatal and adult mouse brain mRNA We have obtained similar results for RPTP data not shown in which exon 14 was reported to be absent NM_002845 The RPTP exon 16 primers yielded two bands of 356 and 326 bp Figure 5Cand 5D This indicates an additional 10 AA alternatively spliced region located between the transmembrane and the first phosphatase domain 2370 2399 nt Both transcripts were present in mouse and human brain and were observed in all brain regions analyzed PCR of the same region in RPTP yielded only one product that did not contain the exon 16 sequence data not shown A third alternatively spliced exon 22a was identified in the first phosphatase domain between exons 22 and 23 Exon 22a was inserted after nucleotide 3172 in mouse and after nucleotide 3232 in human RPTP predicting an additional alternatively spliced region 20 AA in length In each case primers yielded two bands of 93 and 152 bp Figure 5Eand 5F in all brain regions examined It remains to be determined if other members of the type IIB subfamily also contain this exon or whether the region is unique to RPTP Comparison of xenopus mouse and human type IIB RPTP nucleotide sequences indicated the possibility of a fourth alternatively spliced region located 3 to exon 17 within the wedge domain This 75 nt segment is present in the reported sequence of human RPTP 2445 2520 nt and in xenopus RPTP 2448 2523 nt It is absent in the reported sequences of human and mouse RPTP RPTP and PCP 2 The exon 17 18 primers were designed to amplify two potential products of 209 and 134 nt However only a single product of 134 nt was observed in human and mouse brain regions data not shown This sequence appears to be unique to human RPTP and xenopus RPTP and is unlikely to represent an alternatively spliced exon in any of the RPTP IIB genes Both splice variants of exons 14 16 and 22a were present in human and mouse brain at all ages and in all brain regions examined Although the RPTP protein products encoded by the alternatively spliced exons do not appear to encode any known motifs different isoforms of the phosphatase with as yet unknown functions are likely to be present Alternatively spliced isoforms of the related RPTPs LAR 38 and RPTP 39 are spatially and temporally distinct in the central nervous system and there is evidence that alternatively spliced exons can influence ligand binding as is the case with LAR 9 Conclusions We describe the cloning of the mouse RPTP cDNA the genomic structure and alternative splicing of the mouse and human genes and the presence of an 8 kb 3 UTR in human RPTP RPTP is the largest RPTP gene characterized to date extending over more than 1 megabase pairs of genomic DNA Its considerable length is due primarily to expanded introns in the extracellular region The protein domains of the extracellular segment are encoded by 1 to 3 exons which form modules that are flanked by phase 1 introns The majority of introns in the intracellular segment are in phase 0 and are relatively small These data suggest that the ectodomain and the phosphatase domain arose separately by exon shuffling and duplication and fused at a later evolutionary period The MAM domain the region characterizing type IIB phosphatases possesses a unique genomic structure common to all such domains when located at the N terminus The fourth fibronectin repeat in RPTP is encoded by three exons an additional feature found only in type II phosphatases At least two alternatively spliced exons flank the transmembrane domain the region showing the greatest variability between the four IIB phosphatases An additional alternatively spliced exon precedes the catalytic core of the first phosphatase domain Comparison of the genomic structure of representative members of the RPTP family types I V indicates that the intron exon organization of both phosphatase domains is highly conserved There is considerable variation in the length of the 3 UTR in the RPTPs at 8 kb the RPTP 3 UTR is the longest characterized to date Our results provide the first characterization of the genomic structure of an RPTP type IIB gene This information will facilitate future studies of promoter and other regulatory elements responsible for the tissue
