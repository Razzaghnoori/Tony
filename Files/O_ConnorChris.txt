 Hi My name is Chris O Connor And um I m a host family person for Hye Jin And I m I m um I m honored um to participate in the project Um what I would like to do is explain to Hye Jin an experience I had um as as a young child uh something that um has stayed to me really all of my life and is especially meaningful now that I live in the South Because I was born in the North I was raised in the North I you know truly am um I consider myself a northern American um and quite by surprise um we came to live in Charlotte two and a half years ago um mainly for work reasons Both my husband and I had lost our jobs in the North So we came south because this is where the jobs are and fortunately we were able to get work and re located here So this is two and a half years later and my husband and I are employed in the public schools in Charlotte My husband is a teacher and I m a counselor And um we find ourselves in a very diverse school which is all good uh we find ourselves um working with many many more uh black or Afro American people than we were ever exposed in the North And that has um made me remember um that when I was in um the second grade I was seven years old And I was um growing up in the North in Wilmington DE And my father was transferred to Pensacola FL And we had never lived in the South before except for one other brief brief time I should say we had lived in Camden SC um where act actually one of my brothers was born But when I was seven we moved to Pensacola FL and um we there were four children and we were enrolled in a Catholic school because my parents were Catholics and um they wanted us to go to the Catholic schools in the South So I went to I was in the second grade and I went to Sacred Heart School in Pensacola FL And I became friendly Um I made friends And two of my very good girl friends when I was in second grade their names were Patricia Callahan and Linda Emanuel And their families their parents were southern born and bred But um in time we became very close friends and then to our childhood friendships our parents became good friends So most of our social life was spent visiting back and forth in each other s homes and our parents would have dinner together and they would get together and have parties and they really had a wonderful time And um as time wore on and our families and our parents became better acquainted I can imagine that my parents really being the only northern born and bred people began to see the differences in their attitudes uh in their racial attitudes as opposed to the attitudes of their friends and by that I mean um my parents had been raised in the North and there were never um very many black people around But they were never raised with any prejudice I guess I can say they were Christian they were Catholic um I don t believe um they really had any predisposition or any prejudice toward black people And I think that when they moved to the South and they saw the prejudice of their good friends I think it really uh really bothered them to the point that they wanted to make sure that their own children did not grow up with those prejudices And I can give you a good example Now it was very common when I was seven years old and I was the oldest of the four children um my mother hired a black woman to help her once a week The lady s name was Ira Lee and she was a black lady And she would come to our house once a week and she would help my mother clean She would do all kinds of household um activities because my mother had four children very close in age and I m sure she was a big help It was it was just a very acceptable thing to do among middle class people I don t think I really thought twice about it So um my mother learned of Ira Lee from her very close friend my girl friend s mother Um and we all went to the same school together and the same church together And so that s how we found out about Ira Lee And Ira Lee come to our house once a week and then she would help my mother and then at dinner time I can remember we all sit at our dinner table uh four McDonough children and my two parents and Ira Lee always sat at the table with us I remember it very well and she was just part of our family She was like our guest she just ate dinner with us But I ll never forget when we went to have a lunch at my girl friend Patricia s house where Ira Lee also worked And Ira Lee fixed lunch for us And it was my mother and me and my friend Patricia and her mother and my friend Patricia s two sisters and we all sat down at the dinner table together to have the lunch that Ira Lee fixed for us But Ira Lee had to sit in the kitchen by herself It was not considered appropriate I guess it would be the word or it was not considered acceptable in that household to have a black woman sitting with sitting at the same M bjbj 6 W W M 8 l 8 4 X X z z z z z z j z z z z z z z z z z z z L j 0 e e HJ Hye Jin Jung Interviewer Chris O Connor Interviewee START OF TAPE 1 SIDE A Hi My name is Chris O Connor And um I m a host family person for Hye Jin And I m I m um I m honored um to participate in the project Um what I would like to do is explain to Hye Jin an experience I had um as as a young child uh something that um has stayed to me really all of my life and is especially meaningful now that I live in the South Because I was born in the North I was raised in the North I you know truly am um I consider myself a northern American um and quite by surprise um we came to live in Charlotte two and a half years ago um mainly for work reasons Both my husband and I had lost our jobs in the North So we came south because this is where the jobs are and fortunately we were able to get work and re located here So this is two and a half years later and my husband and I are employed in the public schools in Charlotte My husband is a teacher and I m a coher about it later And um my mother I remember this is what I remember my mother s saying This made such an impression on me She said Well don t you ever tell Mrs Callahan that you slept in the same bed with Ira Lee Mrs Callahan would be shocked So I just I just remember that very well and I never ever let this be known that it happened although it didn t bother me because I was very comfortable with Ira Lee You know I didn t even think twice about it And I certainly don t think I was damaged by it at all I just got the very strong message that was not something that should be repeated to this particular lady and the particular lady was a very fine person a very good person a very good mother a very good Catholic but she had been raised in the South And that was totally totally unacceptable to her way of thinking So that s my um recollection of um Ira Lee of um growing up um in the South in the 50 s probably So I just um would like to share that story I think we I think we ve come hopefully we ve come a long way from from that um mode of thinking So that maybe that kind of thinking has changed Do you think maybe Well I think there has been I mean if you figured that was in the 50 s Oh I know there have been a lot of good changes I mean since Martin Luther King and all of that um I still think I still I still know though that there is still prejudice Uh both ways white people to black towards black people and black people towards white people and with all the races it s not just limited to blacks and whites That was just my own personal experience but sometimes now not that I dwell on this when I think of my present working situation were I work in a school really there are the black children are there are more blacks than whites are it s pretty even but a little more black children And you know our faculty we have a black woman principal whom I respect very much I think she is a very fine person And a lot of the black teachers I think I respect them very much I will say that I m quite impressed with some of the black people I notice um black teachers black people uh I notice that at lunchtime when we sit down to have lunch they immediately stop and say a silent prayer immediately that s just routine of them And you know I admire that very much And it s really I see it more with the black people than I do with the white people Um so um yes we ve come a long long way since when I was a little girl But we still have a long way to go too
