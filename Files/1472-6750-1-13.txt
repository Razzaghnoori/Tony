 Introduction The RNA polymerase from bacteriophage T7 has a relatively narrow specificity for a particular promoter sequence making it an extremely useful tool for molecular biology and biotechnology applications Most recently the crystal structure of the polymerase in complex with a DNA promoter has revealed the structural basis for this specificity 1 2 In addition a number of researchers have examined the contribution of various nucleotides and functional groups in the promoter and various amino acids in the polymerase to specificity 3 4 5 Based upon both structural and mutagenic analyses it has proven possible to identify polymerase variants with altered specificities for promoters 6 7 Polymerase variants with altered specificities have also been identified using genetic selections 8 However the variant polymerases and variant promoters that have so far been identified are close in sequence to the wild type For example the only known polymerase variant that switches promoters contains a single amino acid change recognizes a single nucleotide change in the promoter and closely mimics interactions known to occur for T3 RNA polymerase 9 The large sequence space that surrounds both polymerases and promoters has so far prevented more sweeping searches for more diverse variants To address this problem we have developed a combined in vitro in vivo selection method based on T7 RNA polymerase autogene construct that allows large 10 3 10 6 libraries of T7 RNA polymerase variants to be efficiently searched for specificity mutants The method is novel in that it allows selection of polymerases based on their in vivo enzymatic activity is generalizable and may have applications for other polymerase phenotypes such as intracellular solubility or thermostability Results and Discussion Our combined in vitro in vivo selection scheme was designed to foster the self amplification of novel polymerase variants Figure 1 The T7 RNA polymerase gene was linked to a T7 RNA polymerase promoter creating a so called autogene 10 whose activity can be initiated by the basal level expression of polymerase in the cell Upon transformation into E coli the autogene engendered the production of large amounts of T7 RNA polymerase Figure 2 However when the polymerase was cloned adjacent to mutant T7 RNA polymerase promoters little T7 RNA polymerase expression was observed We reasoned that any polymerase variant that could recognize the mutant promoter would re establish the feedback loop and concomitantly lead not only to high protein expression levels but also to high mRNA expression levels In consequence mRNA extracted from a population of cells transformed with a polymerase library should represent polymerase variants in rough proportion to their ability to utilize the mutant promoter These mRNAs could be amplified en masse re cloned and re transformed into E coli Multiple cycles of selection and amplification should ultimately lead to the accumulation of those polymerase variants that were most successful at facilitating their own expression Of course high level expression of any protein product can potentially be detrimental to cell growth which would undermine the proposed selection In order to evaluate the effect of toxicity of autogene on the selection process the effect of the wild type autogene construct pET T7p T7 on cell growth was studied before and after induction with IPTG Figure 3 These initial studies showed that the wild type autogene did not affect cellular viability for at least 2 3 hours after induction with IPTG Therefore we reasoned that isolating the mRNA after an hour of induction should not drastically affect the selection process We initially searched for polymerase variants that could utilize a promoter variant in which there was a G to C change at position 11 This mutation resembles the bacteriophage T3 promoter A single asparagine to aspartate substitution at position 748 in T7 RNA polymerase was already known to facilitate the utilization of the T3 like promoter 6 A library of polymerase variants was constructed in which amino acid residues 746 747 and 748 were completely randomized While we expected to obtain sequence changes primarily at position 748 randomization of residues 746 and 747 served as respectively positive and negative controls for the experiment Residue 746 is normally an arginine that interacts with the guanosine 2 5 at position 7 and should remain unchanged following selection Residue 747 is a leucine residue that does not make direct contacts to the promoter We therefore expected that the leucine should vary during the course of the selection or that one of six different leucine codons might be chosen The library of polymerase variants was cloned behind the T3 like promoter and three rounds of selection and amplification as described in Figure 1 were carried out In each round at least 5 000 individual variants were examined a number that encompassed a large fraction of the possible variants 8 000 The progress of the selection was monitored in two ways first the autogene constructs were under the control of the lac repressor and we had previously noted that complete depression of the wild type autogene by IPTG led to cell death Therefore the fraction of colonies that were lost on replica plating to IPTG was assumed to be proportional to the accumulation of active autogene variants Second the number of PCR cycles that were required to amplify recovered mRNA molecules was assumed to follow the amount of mRNA that was produced in a given round of selection Both of these variables showed substantial improvement following two rounds of selection but less improvement following three rounds for example the proportion of IPTG sensitive colonies was 20 after one round of selection 88 after two rounds and 96 after three rounds The selection was therefore deemed to be essentially complete following round three Active polymerase variants were identified cloned and sequenced following each round of selection As can be seen in Table 1 the selection not only quickly re established the wild type amino acids at positions 746 arginine and 747 leucine but also converged on the known N748D change indicating that the combined in vitro in vivo selection method was working as desired It is likely that the N748D substitution that arose in the first generation was passed to subsequent generations since there was no variation in the codons TTA G associated with this gene during the course of the selection Interestingly while the N748D substitution eventually dominates the selection a N748Q substitution was also prevalent in Round 2 The mutant is known to be able to recognize the T3 like promoter 9 albeit less well than the N748D substitution Thus our selection scheme not only identifies functional polymerases but the selected population seems to represent variants in proportion to their functionality To examine a wider range of promoter and polymerase combinations a promoter library was constructed in which positions 8 through 11 in the promoter were completely randomized each of these nucleotides had previously been shown to be extremely important for the specificity of interactions with T7 RNA polymerase 6 7 9 11 Conversely residues Asn 748 Arg 756 and Gln 758 were known to form sequence specific contacts with this region of the promoter 2 The promoter library was combined with the gene library in order to create approximately 51 200 4 4 20 3 combinations of promoters and polymerases The joint promoter polymerase library was transformed into E coli and variants were again selected according to their transcript representation following RT PCR amplification To begin each new cycle the polymerase variants were re cloned behind the promoter library The success of an individual polymerase variant relied upon either being able to utilize several different promoters in different rounds a generalist strategy or upon being very active with the same promoter in different rounds a specialist strategy Given the number of promoter variants 256 the number of possible polymerase variants 8 000 and the number of transformants that were assessed in each round 10 5 10 6 it is likely that there was a population bottleneck during the first round of selection However selected polymerase variants should have had access to all possible promoters following the first round After three cycles of selection and amplification there was still some diversity in the population Table 1 but after four cycles a single variant Q758C had largely established itself The Q758C variant was frequently found adjacent to the wild type T7 RNA polymerase promoter GACT at positions 11 through 8 but was also found adjacent to a single mutant promoter GAC G double mutant promoters GA TA G T C A a triple mutant promoter G TTA and a promoter in which all the residues differed from wild type TGTA Overall the generalist polymerase appeared to prefer mutant promoters that contained a T at position 9 and G or A at 8 positions The Q758C mutant has previously been assayed for its activity at position 8 with different bases and was shown to prefer G or A at 8 compared to the wild type promoter 8T 7 This finding was further borne out in our experiments the Q758C GAC G polymerase promoter combination yielded substantially more T7 RNA polymerase as judged by gel electrophoresis than did Q758C GACT wt Figure 2a Another mutant polymerase R3 17 selected from round three differed from the wild type at all the three amino acid positions N748A R756M Q758S Despite the fact that this variant was extremely novel it was nonetheless completely functional and yielded as much or more polymerase expression when paired with its promoter G GTA than did the wild type polymerase paired with the wild type promoter GACT Figure 2b The ability to use this triple mutant promoter had not previously been observed To further explore the apparent change in promoter specificity of this polymerase we carried out an additional screen in which R3 17 was again cloned adjacent to the library of promoter mutations and replica plated colonies that grew poorly or not at all upon IPTG induction indicating polymerase overproduction were picked and sequenced In addition to the original promoter G GTA two other promoters T A TA and TGTA were identified It is interesting that all of the promoters derived from the screen have a cytidine to thymidine substitution at position 9 and a thymidine to adenosine substitution at position 8 This combination of residues has not previously been shown to yield an active T7 RNA polymerase promoter Consonant with our genetic screen the R3 17 polymerase paired with each of the three promoters appeared to yield as much or more T7 RNA polymerase as did wild type autogene paired with the wild type promoter Figure 2b Previous studies of T7 promoter recognition in vitro have indicated that the wild type T7 RNA polymerase does not tolerate mutations well particularly at positions 8 to 11 in the T7 promoter 9 11 In agreement with these studies we found no mutant promoters that could apparently pair with the wild type polymerase see Table 1 It is becoming increasingly clear that some protein phenotypes can only be accessed by simultaneously generating a large number of mutations 12 13 14 15 However conventional directed evolution and screening techniques typically examine proteins that contain only one or two amino acid substitutions For example the incorporation of single base pair substitutions in the promoter has identified nucleotides critical for polymerase recognition but did not identify novel promoter specificities 11 Similarly a series of polymerases having all possible amino acid substitutions at position 748 were screened along with all possible single base pair substitutions at positions 10 through 12 of the promoter region 9 While the functional importance of the nucleotides and amino acid residues was confirmed no new promoter specificities were identified Our combined in vitro in vivo selection technique allows the examination of a relatively large number of polymerase sequence variants and has discovered promoter and enzyme variants that would likely never have been observed by rational mutagenesis or more limited screens On the basis of the known crystal structure of T7 RNA polymerase bound to a 17 base pair double stranded promoter sequence it appears that T7 promoter recognition occurs largely through direct or water mediated hydrogen bonding 2 The identities of at least some of the selected mutants can be rationalized on the basis of the known protein DNA contacts For example residue N748 recognizes G 11 in the non template strand via both direct and indirect hydrogen bonds the N748D substitution has previously been hypothesized to form an alternate hydrogen bonding network with the G 11C substitution 2 Similarly in the wild type polymerase residue Q758 makes a direct hydrogen bond to the adenosine at position 8 in the template strand The generalist polymerase contains the single Q758C substitution and the shorter cysteine residue may allow or at the least not interfere with a larger range of nucleic acid interactions However the selected substitutions cannot always be conveniently rationalized the R3 17 mutant differs from the wild type T7 RNA polymerase at all the three amino acid positions N748A R756M Q758S replacing some amino acids with hydrophobic residues that do not likely form specific hydrogen bonding interactions Moreover it is likely that the promoter recognition differs during different stages of transcription initiation 16 17 and it is unclear what particular contacts are made during open and closed complex formation and during productive versus abortive initiation Additional characterization of the kinetics and mechanism of the apparently altered promoter specificities will be required before more secure models can be put forth Combined in vitro in vivo selections should generally prove to be useful for altering the properties of many molecular biology enzymes For example a compartmentalized self replication has been reported for the selection of thermostable variants of Taq DNA polymerase 18 This method is similar to ours except that instead of collecting mRNAs from intact cells the cellular test tubes expressing Taq polymerase are first embedded in water in oil emulsions and lysed prior to recovery of functional genes These methods are nicely complementary our method potentially allows for in vivo properties to be optimized e g the selection of strong cellular promoters while cellular emulsion allows for in vitro properties to be optimized e g the utilization of unnatural nucleotides that might not be taken up by cells Both methods allow similarly large numbers of mutational variants to be simultaneously compared and competed and both methods can potentially be adapted to a range of molecular biology enzymes that act on their own templates such as restriction endonucleases or DNA ligases Conclusions In this study we have developed a facile in vitro in vivo selection methodology using a T7 RNA polymerase autogene to select polymerase variants with apparently altered promoter specificities The procedure allows large libraries of promoter variants to be efficiently searched for their promoter recognition ability in vivo The selection was successfully employed to identify a mutant T7 RNA polymerase specialist which could recognize and transcribe a T3 like promoter a polymerase generalist which was able to recognize a variety of T7 promoters and a novel RNA polymerase with an apparently new promoter specificity The method can potentially be adapted to evolve other polymerases with novel phenotypes Materials and Methods Construction of the wild type autogene Using plasmid pAR1219 originally made by Studier et al 19 and obtained from Dr David Hoffman University of Texas at Austin as a template a 2 7 kb fragment containing the T7 RNA polymerase gene was amplified EcoRI and BsmBI restriction sites were added during amplification The PCR product was cloned into the vector pCR2 1 TA cloning kit Invitrogen Carlsbad CA and then into plasmid pET28a Novagen Madison WI which contained the wild type T7 RNA polymerase promoter The wild type autogene thus obtained pET T7p T7 was transformed into strain HMS174 pLysS Novagen Madison WI the same cell line Studier et al initially used to express the autogene

distribution of random sequence nucleotides was estimated to be 29 G 21 A 19 T and 24 C Selection and screening protocols The autogene pool was transformed into DH5 lac pLysS cells by electroporation The culture was incubated at 37 C for 7 10 hrs and T7 RNA polymerase expression was induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 0 4 mM After an hour of induction RNA was extracted using the Masterpure RNA purification kit Epicenter Technologies Madison WI The recovered mRNA was reverse transcribed using AMV reverse transcriptase Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc Newark NJ and the primer gc3 pET The cDNA was then PCR amplified using the primers gcT7a 6 and gc3 pET The PCR products were gel purified digested with AflII and EcoRI and cloned back into the original autogene vector to form a delimited autogene pool for subsequent rounds of selection A colony lift technique was used to monitor the progress of the selection Cells containing active autogene cease to grow when lifted to LB plates containing IPTG Colonies from each round of selection were lifted to plates containing IPTG using a butterfly nitrcellulose membrane Midwest Scientific Valley Park MO The plates were then incubated at 37 C for 8 hrs Clones that did not grow upon re plating were picked from the original plate A similar protocol was used for the identification of promoters that could be recognized by the R3 17 polymerase In this instance the R3 17 polymerase gene was first isolated via restriction digestion with AflII and EcoRI cloned downstream of the T7 promoter pool and the resultant promoter library was transformed as before Colonies ca 3 000 were lifted to IPTG plates and screened for their inability to thrive
