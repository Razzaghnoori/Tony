 We Are All on Good Morning America Good Morning Andrew I can t retrieve my e mail at the moment Could it be because I am treasuring 1275 messages in my inbox Anyway I will just send off into the blue my thoughts on seeing Peter Kurth brother of Barbara Kurth on Good Morning America I think You ll remember that Barbara Kurth is the mother whose daughters were kidnapped by her ex husband Stephen Fagan who changed his name and lived in shadowy splendor in Palm Beach Florida raising the girls as they are always called they re now 21 and 23 having told them their mother died in a car crash Barbara Kurth got no help from FBI or legal system in tracking him down by the way because the kidnapping took place in l979 before parental kidnapping was covered by appropriate laws She spent all her money on private eyes to no avail So of course since she is the mother Barbara Kurth has been attacked in the media solely on the basis of allegations by Stephen Fagan who says she was an alcoholic who neglected the children leaving him no choice She denies his charge which was investigated by the court after all which found them untrue and gave her custody He doesn t explain why he kept up the deception for two decades long after his ex wife had clearly overcome her problems if she ever had any and had gotten a Ph D she is now a professor of cell biology married but no kids His whole family was in on it too his parents also moved to Florida It s hard to imagine the cruelty involved here Anyway I turn on the TV in my hotel room in Whittier California which is as every single person I mentioned this place to reminded me where Nixon went to college why do we all have this little fact so firmly implanted in our brains and there was Barbara Kurth s brother Peter being interviewed by Katie Couric And what amazed me is that here was this ordinary American man who had been suddenly plucked from obscurity by the hand of fate and he knew exactly what to do on television How to sit not too slumpy not too stiff what to do with his hands kept them quiet don t gesticulate or fiddle with your ear or other body part how to arrange his expressions relaxed alert open affable how to speak in sound bites don t digress don t get mad don t talk too long It was as though he d been on TV every day for years Talk to you later Katha
