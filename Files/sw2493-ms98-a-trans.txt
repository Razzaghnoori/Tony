 okay what kind of TV shows do you like well uh i don t have a lot of time to watch TV unfortunately this is not a good subject um i uh huh when the little bit of time i do get to spend because i m in school in the evenings um uh i like to watch movies and comedies and uh i watch the news i see uh huh the news and the only game type shows that i ever watch are Wheel Of Fortune okay how about you um i don t i don t care for Wheel Of Fortune very much i don t care for game shows in general i guess uh they re not usually there s usually not that many on in the evening anyway so about the Wheel Of Fortune is about the only one that s on in the evening times well yeah i know oh i haven t watched it in ages but uh you know yeah yeah um i do like uh uh well they had a good TV movie on last night called Separate But Equal oh yes i didn t get a chance to see that it s a General Motors hall of fame type presentation uh it s a two parter the other part s on tonight but it was about the uh the uh the well it s supposed to be a true story you know a dramatization the true story of the legal struggle that uh uh huh ended up in the Supreme Court decision Brown versus the Board of Education which ended up um oh saying that separate and equal is not constitutional as far as you know schools it was talking about and it was interesting it was a uh huh it s it s it s really a high one of these high drama type you know uh shows that s also true any of those things i like Hall Mark Hall Of Fame and those kind of shows are always so good i like i like to watch those oh yes yes they are they i love those but they unfortunately they don t have nearly enough of those those and the National Geographic ones specials those those are great too right right oh yeah i can watch those National Geographic ones over and over again yeah i know what you mean and they re they re good they re they re i like news shows too like uh Sixty Minutes or Twenty Twenty uh huh uh when i have a chance i watch those on uh i guess Sixty Minutes is usually on Sundays and uh i just like to see you know who they are raking over the coals yes well you know it interesting they have a new one out have you ever watched Expose Expose i haven t caught that one yet uh that s kind of one along the line of Sixty Sixty i mean that excuse me Twenty Twenty and uh yeah Sixty Minutes but uh Twenty Twenty uh i ve only watched it once uh like i said i ve been in class and uh so during the week uh i don t have much time and i spend a lot of time with uh my daughter on the weekend and she lives uh huh a way away so uh i m you we re not usually watching TV but uh but it is interesting uh they this time of year unfortunately it gets right right right kind of most of them are reruns and you know stuff like that that s why i kind of stick to the movies if they re good uh that one sounds good though that was on last night i didn t get a chance to i didn t get home till ten so yeah right uh huh yeah yeah it s like right well that makes it hard yeah that was a good show um what else do i enjoy oh my wife and i have been into this uh uh LA Law have you ever heard of that show yeah uh huh i ve heard of it i haven t watched it uh uh huh it s getting pretty you know it s kind of like a Dallas type thing you know but it s more of it it takes place in LA and it s this law office and all the cases they take and the and the uh interoffice uh uh politics and so forth people trying to maneuver and get power and back stabbing and also helping each other and you know if you know all the love interoffice love affairs and uh all that all that kind of stuff and you know power struggles to see who s going to be the next uh uh oh uh huh president of the law firm or whatever and that kind of thing and uh and then of course they always have a lot of court cases and they show where they actually have courtroom drama yeah uh huh type thing where they re trying to you know you re always sitting there trying to guess at the end of the show you know and they always have the verdicts you know and you re always trying to out guess is he going to be guilty or innocent or whatever and they always put you know twists and turns twists i was just going to say yeah usually twist it you know it s hard oh yeah they throw a lot of twists and turns in like like one of the recent shows there was this really uh a young woman who uh was accused of killing her millionaire husband who was you know much older than she was like you know in her early twenties and he was in his sixties and he was she was accused of killing him for his money and she said no she wasn t and the and this law firm took on the case and got her off uh huh um and uh and you know you think she s innocent all along you know and just you know because because of her circumstances that you know that s why people thought she had done it you know because it just looked so obvious that she had done it and that s why everybody assumed she had right and so they get her off and at the very end of the case after it s over he s talking with her and he figures out that she really did do it after all a uh after after he got after he got her off oh my gracious so what did he do then ooh yeah well then they couldn t retry her oh well that s how the show that s how the show ended it just left you hanging there like you know like you set me up you fed me all this information information you know that made it look like this other person was guilty you know and oh uh huh and that s how he basically got her off by by casting a shadow of doubt saying well this other his daughter did it you know and because this other will was had her name on it you know and all this kind of stuff but actually she had done it after all and he figured it out after he made her innocent and then that was right before he was going out to the big news conference you know to oh my good to talk to the reporters and stuff you know and how does it feel be you know to get her off the hook and this and that and they he went out there knowing that she was really guilty so that kind of thing so it s a fun show then i like comedies also like uh yeah oh there s a show call i watch Roseanne once in a while uh you you ve heard of her probably yeah yeah oh yes i don t watch her anymore not after that Star Spangled Banned thing yeah yeah i don t watch her that often i watch sometimes i watch The Simpsons that s that cartoon show uh huh i ve never watched that either Bart Simpson s or a Coach is another one it s a sports comedy where the guy is a coach of a a football team a team Minnesota State where they re never have a good team you know but he s always trying to i have watched that yeah that s good always try ing to pull it off and he has his a girlfriend a a broadcasts anchor at the local news station and she s always trying to get him out of jams and she so you know whatever whenever i have time i just turn it on basically and see what s on yeah it s a nice way to relax i mean in a way i mean i find it anyway although sometimes watching the news isn t very relaxing i get home from from it is no no class and everything and turn on the TV and watch the news early news and it s like uh i i didn t really need to watch that before i go to bed you know right yeah so but i enjoy taking in a movie when i can i m going to try to watch the second half of this one tonight yeah well see that was that s another if i would have been home probably wouldn t have watched it because i have class tonight and i would have missed the second half and that s the most frustrating because that s you know you can if you missed the first half yeah yeah yeah yeah you can kind of catch up they catch you up you know with the second one but if you miss the second half you ve missed the whole you know outcome and oh it s frustrating they catch you up and the right do you have like a a VCR where you could tape it or something on the record mode or on the time yeah no i don t unfortunately we have cable but that s one thing i need to we had one but it broke down so uh i haven t gotten another one because i haven t you know i haven t even hm it broke down yeah yeah right rented movies to watch because yeah yeah but uh but perhaps perhaps when it s over i will you you know i of course so little so little time to do that yeah have a chance more chance to relax right well that s it i but i have gotten we have cable and so um that s right there s always a movie on yeah sometimes i spend a lot of time on that some movies that i would never have gone and seen uh you know have turned out to be really good movies uh you know you hate to spend the money on them especially as expensive as movie theaters are today you right right how much are they out there uh movies oh uh it costs you six fifty to go to a movie each a piece to go to uh a movie unless you catch a good matinee yeah six fifty yeah hm out here i it s i think out here they are still about five fifty about a dollar less uh huh well uh everything s high priced out here but uh uh things are going up all over too yeah yeah yeah uh but i d rather you know watch it on of course the only problem with cable though is it s it s is that they show the same one over about five hundred times before you know you don t get that many new ones in but uh uh right they have a lot of good uh my son likes to watch uh the sports station you know and uh specials uh huh yeah the all sports station yeah right uh you know things like that so uh that s what makes it worth it uh because he s handicapped and he s at home all the time so so uh uh huh right i see uh you know he enjoys that but uh um i i like i said TV isn t my best subject because but i i do enjoy a good comedy a good movie is a comedy if i can you know sit down and and watch or if they have a good uh right you know show on that s a good comedy i m not real much for the sitcoms because of their they need to have a new twist or something in some of those you know they re getting all kind of the same but um uh uh huh the same yeah yeah it s just well i think we ve probably talked long enough about this subject uh yes uh okay well it was nice talking to you and uh well it was nice talking to you and you have a nice day okay you too bye bye now okay bye
