            okay so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning gifts products   uh not too bad really um i had a razor that i got for Christmas that i just i really didnt want it but i got it anyway and uh it was a Braun and they were real good about taking it back it wasnt a problem at all so uh i was able to get that back pretty easily   umhum   but uh i dont know i really havent returned a whole lot lately have you   i havent had to its uh the every so often i mean i i im almost pushing it myself maybe ill buy a shirt from GI Joes and it shrinks too much and say well i should have known better i mean i bought it from GI Joes and it was probably made in China by slaves   um  right   but uh  they uh most of the time  pretty careful shopping anyway i get pretty good stuff i think that uh aside from the fact all markets being internationalized and if you want to buy American it takes real extra work to find      yeah right like exactly i was reading   and its probably a Japanese or a Burmese company owning and hiring people in the US   right i was reading something in uh Consumer Reports tonight about that as a matter of fact they were talking about cars uh the car issue just came out and about how yeah youd like to buy an American car maybe but uh you know the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever   uhhuh yeah   um like ive got an eighty six Ford Ranger and and i know for a fact that the transmission is made by Mitsubishi you know so its like what are you going to do you know   huh yeah really   but uh thats the way it is i dont know i i personally feel that uh uh if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them you know thats the way it goes and you know people manufacturers American manufacturers should get a clue and you know they should start making quality products and   yeah i think theyre beginning to the the days of dont buy a car made on a Monday or a Friday are pretty much going away and   thats what i thought too until i saw the Consumer Reports issue uh theyve got all the American well all the cars all the cars rated you know and uh   uhhuh   essentially i havent i dont see much of a trend i mean just like every other time that you look at it the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there theres nothing wrong with them uh and the same thing with most of the other Japanese cars but then again you look at a Ford or especially a Chevy and theyre pieces of junk you know   oh know still at it hey   yeah thats ninety thats eighty six through ninety one but uh i dont know maybe maybe theyre getting better maybe theyre starting to get a clue uh   wow well they got a three year lead time it probably wont start really showing up until ninety four or so   yeah thats just it technology that that comes in right now is is probably not going to be implemented implemented until you know quite a few years down the road but uh   hm the computer industrys where its really dynamic especially for the consumer   oh yeah because technology is so uh you know volatile and changing all the time uh   and can you think of any other industry where in software they uh if the product is upgraded and a better version is put out youll get a free version in the mail its like here   yeah   or uh maybe they say well you we know you paid five hundred bucks for this program so send us twenty and well give you a really great upgrade      yeah it uh they they keep up good with it pretty quickly and thats thats a real good thing i guess     yeah   um i dont know   and the hardware well i mean all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity and the Macintosh is about the only one thats going its right forcing IBM and the rest of the DOS world to follow along   yeah right theyre kind of the leaders right now you know i used to see all those commercials for Windows you know and youre like oh gee theyre reselling a Macintosh under a different name     really why dont they just say almost a Mac for half the price they could sell more if they were honest   yeah you know almost exactly almost is the key word there too you know because i i really ive used both and i really dont see an advantage of Windows at all uh   yeah it its only an advantage for people who had to use pure DOS   yeah yeah thats just it   i mean thats their client base   but uh i dont know im really ive gotten a little bit out of the the personal computer business just because i dont have one at home i i do use a Mac at work but uh   umhum   uh i really dont dont do much with it at home but uh   Apples sort of making a  and theyre ones were growling consumer uh need to worry about the Mac theyre getting like if you bought a power book straight off a lot of them had to go back they issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with the floppy drive   right uhhuh yeah you sound like you must uh work in the computer business   yeah i have one i do desktop publishing at work and i have a machine at home and i belong to the users group and i ive been a Mac fanatic since they came out   yeah all right   but uh technically im not actually in the industry i dont work for a computer company im an abuser   no well thats thats all right   but its sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to you know keep up with the changes as they happen   yeah thats true something that i find uncomfortable is you know you you want to buy something say you want to buy a personal computer and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for you know let lets take the example of a modem for you know   yeah   okay what what what baud rate do you get well you know it used to be that you get a twelve hundred baud
