 Background DNA microarrays have proven very useful in establishing molecular definitions of human cancer subtypes 1 2 3 In some cases cancers that were assigned to a single diagnostic category by conventional morphological diagnostic methods have been found to have different gene expression profiles and belong to distinct molecular subtypes In particular diffuse large B cell lymphoma DLBCL was shown to consist of at least two molecular subtypes that differed in the expression of over several hundred genes 1 Furthermore patients with these two DLBCL subtypes had strikingly different long term outcomes following conventional multi agent chemotherapy Patients with germinal center B like DLBCL had a favorable prognosis with an apparent cure rate of 75 On the other hand patients with activated B like DLBCL had a poor prognosis with less than a quarter of these patients alive five years following therapy Therefore for patients with activated B like DLBCL alternative therapeutic agents must be identified For this reason we have begun a survey of novel cancer agents in order to identify drugs with significant activity against activated B like DLBCL One drug identified in this screen flavopiridol was found to be significantly cytotoxic for cell lines derived from activated B like DLBCL Flavopiridol is a member of the growing family of cyclin dependent kinase CDK inhibitors that have varying activities against the multiple CDK family members CDK1 CDK2 CDK4 CDK6 and CDK7 by competitively blocking their ATP binding pocket 4 5 6 7 8 In addition to arresting cells in vitro at the G2 to M and the G1 to S transitions flavopiridol decreases the rate of progression through S phase Since flavopiridol is being evaluated in multiple cancer clinical trials 7 9 and has been shown to be highly active in inducing apoptosis in hematopoietic neoplasms 10 we were interested in whether flavopiridol might be effective against activated B like DLBCL Although it is clear that flavopiridol inhibits CDKs whether flavopiridol inhibits other cellular targets is not known Recently flavopiridol was found to inhibit the activity of a transcription elongation factor P TEFb a complex of cyclins with CDK9 11 P TEFb phosphorylates the carboxy terminal domain of the RNA polymerase II complex 12 facilitating transcription elongation It was not known however whether P TEFb regulates transcriptional elongation of all cellular genes or whether other factors promote transcriptional elongation on subsets of cellular genes Using DNA microarrays we found that flavopiridol inhibited gene expression broadly in a manner highly related to other transcription inhibitors such as actinomycin D and 5 6 dichloro 1 D ribofuranosyl benzimidazole DRB We were therefore able to use flavopiridol to study the turnover rate of mRNA on a genomic scale mRNA turnover is regulated by a variety of cellular factors acting on cis elements in mRNA molecules For many labile mRNAs adenylate uridylate rich elements AREs are required for their rapid degradation Three different classes of ARE have been defined 13 A conserved motif present in two of these classes AUUUA plays an important role in transcript stability for many cytokines and early response genes ERGs 13 However there is now increasing evidence that other motifs may determine the stability of transcripts 14 By measuring mRNA turnover rates comprehensively we identified unexpected relationships between the function of a gene and its mRNA stability In addition we found that genes that were transcriptionally inducible were disproportionately represented in the class of genes with labile mRNAs thus revealing a coordinated strategy to rapidly modulate the mRNA levels of these genes This understanding of mRNA turnover on a genomic scale provides fresh insights into the effectiveness of flavopiridol as an anti cancer agent Results and discussion To investigate the effect of flavopiridol treatment on activated B like DLBCL we used cell line OCI Ly3 as our model of activated B like DLBCL as its gene expression profile closely resembles the profiles of lymphoma biopsy samples from patients with this type of DLBCL 1 OCI Ly3 were treated for 3 hours with flavopiridol 1 M and gene expression changes were monitored using Lymphochip DNA microarrays 15 In comparison to untreated OCI Ly3 cells flavopiridol treatment decreased expression of 284 out of 5 032 microarray elements 5 64 by at least twofold data not shown Similarly profound decreases in mRNA levels were observed following flavopiridol treatment of other lymphoma cell lines data not shown The magnitude of the flavopiridol effect on gene expression was related to the dose of the drug used Figure 1a We found that there was almost no effect on gene expression in cells treated with 60 nM flavopiridol for 1 and 3 hours whereas 300 nM flavopiridol induced broad changes in gene expression and 1 mM flavopiridol was yet more potent in decreasing mRNA levels Patients receiving infusions of flavopiridol achieve a biologically active concentration in plasma of 300 nM 16 To relate these gene expression changes to the biological activity of flavopiridol we assayed the viability of OCI Ly3 cells treated with different doses of flavopiridol Figure 1b Flavopiridol at a concentration of 60 nM had no effect on viability even after 48 hours treatment In contrast 250 nM flavopiridol decreased the viability of OCI Ly3 cells at 8 hours Given the similar dose response effects of flavopiridol on cytotoxicity and gene expression it is likely that the global reduction in mRNA levels caused by flavopiridol is a major contributor to its cytotoxic action Flavopiridol is a member of the growing family of CDK inhibitors that have varying activities against the multiple CDK family members As most of the CDK inhibitors bind to the ATP binding pocket of the CDKs 17 and all CDKs have similar ATP binding pockets it was possible that other CDK inhibitors also inhibit transcription We determined whether the inhibition of transcription is specific to flavopiridol by comparing gene expression profiles of flavopiridol treated cells with those of cells treated with the CDK inhibitors roscovitine and 9 nitropaullone Roscovitine is a purine derivative that inhibits CDK1 CDK2 and CDK5 and blocks cell cycle progression both in late G1 early S and in M phase 18 19 20 21 9 nitropaullone the most potent member of a novel class of the paullone CDK inhibitor family inhibits CDK1 cyclin B at 10 fold lower concentrations than flavopiridol and roscovitine 22 23 24 As shown in Figure 1c the gene expression changes caused by roscovitine and 9 nitropaullone were different from those of flavopiridol and only flavopiridol globally reduced mRNA levels To determine whether flavopiridol affects transcription globally we compared the gene expression profile of flavopiridol treatment with the gene expression profiles induced in OCI Ly3 cells by treatment with two well studied transcriptional inhibitors actinomycin D and DRB Actinomycin D inhibits transcription initiation broadly by intercalating into DNA whereas DRB inhibits the transcription elongation factor P TEFb 12 P TEFb is a complex of cyclins with CDK9 and flavopiridol can also inhibit this kinase 11 However it was not known whether P TEFb regulates transcriptional elongation of all cellular genes nor was it known whether flavopiridol would inhibit the same set of genes as DRB OCI Ly3 cells were treated with each inhibitor and the resultant changes in gene expression were found to be virtually indistinguishable Figure 2a For the majority of well measured genes on the Lymphochip the mRNA abundance decreased with first order kinetics Figure 3 and could therefore be used to measure mRNA turnover rates see Materials and methods Genes are grouped according to mRNA half life in Figure 2a The turnover rates of representative mRNAs were verified by northern blot analysis in Figure 2band quantitated in Figure 2c These findings demonstrate that all three compounds behave as global inhibitors of transcription and demonstrate that P TEFb regulates the transcriptional elongation of most cellular genes Further the similar effects of flavopiridol and DRB argue that the predominant effect of flavopiridol on gene expression results from its ability to inhibit P TEFb To investigate whether the mRNA degradation rates were first order we fitted a linear regression model for the three drugs for each gene see Materials and methods The adjusted R squared statistic which is a measure of correlation between the observed data values and the predicted values from the linear model shows how well a first order kinetics model would describe the mRNA degradation rates Figure 3shows a histogram of the adjusted R squared statistics obtained from fitting a model for each of the 2 794 genes The median adjusted R squared was 0 86 and 79 7 of the genes had an adjusted R squared statistic over 0 7 showing that most of the genes had first order mRNA degradation rates Given the demonstration that flavopiridol is a global transcriptional inhibitor we wished to understand the selective activity of flavopiridol against certain cancer types in vivo Clearly genes with short mRNA half lives would be most rapidly and quantitatively inhibited by flavopiridol and thus we wished to assign the genes with short half lives in OCI Ly3 cells to functional classes First we searched for genes involved in cellular proliferation that have unstable mRNAs as decreased expression of these genes might provide a mechanism by which flavopiridol preferentially targets proliferating cancer cells Microarray gene expression analysis can readily identify a proliferation signature consisting of hundreds of genes that vary in expression between proliferating and quiescent cells 1 25 Genes can be assigned to the proliferation signature on the basis of high expression in diverse cell lines and low expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL a malignancy in which the leukemic cells are primarily in G0 G1 phase of the cell cycle 1 Figure 4apresents 23 genes with half lives of less than 4 hours for which the average expression in six cell lines was fourfold greater than the average expression in three CLL samples This selection criteria identified c myc a gene previously known to have a short lived mRNA and an obviously important target of flavopiridol given its role in G1 S phase progression 26 Interestingly roughly half of these genes 11 23 are expressed preferentially in M phase and or encode proteins involved in M phase events These genes represent important targets of flavopiridol action as they encode M phase regulatory kinases PLK aurora IPL1 related kinase and ckshs2 M phase checkpoint proteins CHK1 and chromosome segregation proteins CENP E CENP F Figure 4a Given the relatively short duration of M phase in most cells the short half lives of these mRNAs may be important to ensure that key M phase regulators are not expressed as the cell progresses from M to G1 phase Another important class of genes that might contribute to the efficacy of flavopiridol would include anti apoptotic genes with rapid mRNA turnover Figure 4b Two anti apoptotic Bcl 2 family members that were expressed in OCI Ly3 cells A1 and MCL1 had mRNA half lives shorter than 3 hours Three members of the IAP family c IAP1 c IAP2 NAIP had very short mRNA half lives and encode anti apoptotic proteins that act by directly binding to caspases 3 7 and 9 27 The NF B target gene A20 an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor TNF induced apoptosis 28 is expressed in OCI Ly3 cells and had a very short mRNA half life As TNF is expressed by OCI Ly3 cells inhibition of A20 expression by flavopiridol treatment may contribute to its cytotoxic effect on these cells In accord with these results flavopiridol treatment was recently shown to downregulate two of these anti apoptotic proteins MCL1 and Bag 1 and induce apoptosis in B CLL cells treated with flavopiridol 29 The majority of the genes with labile mRNAs however did not fall into the cell cycle or apoptosis categories but instead included many genes that are known to be inducible by cellular signaling For example transcription factors belonging to the NF B family are activated by a wide variety of cellular signaling events and several known NF B target genes A1 A20 c IAP1 c IAP2 I B alpha I B epsilon CD54 IL 6 IL 8 TNF IRF 4 were found to have unstable mRNAs Figure 4d This observation led us to investigate the possibility that the class of genes that are transcriptionally induced by cellular signaling events is enriched for genes with labile mRNAs We used Lymphochip microarrays to profile the changes in gene expression that occurred in response to a wide variety of signaling events B cell lymphoma cell lines stimulated by crosslinking the B cell antigen receptor or by treatment with phorbol ester and ionomycin PI resting peripheral blood T cells stimulated with PI and peripheral blood monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide Figure 4dshows genes with relatively short mRNA half lives 2 hours and 2 4 hours that were also transcriptionally induced at least threefold in one of the cellular activation experiments described above Roughly one third of the inducible genes in OCI Ly3 cells were in this rapid mRNA turnover category Figure 4c By contrast 16 8 of the genes that were not induced by these stimuli had mRNA half lives of less than 4 hours P 0 001 This analysis of mRNA turnover in OCI Ly3 cells therefore suggested that transcriptionally inducible genes are as a class likely to generate labile mRNAs To test this notion we profiled mRNA turnover rates in peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs after stimulation with PI PBMCs were stimulated with PI for 3 hours at which time flavopiridol was added and mRNA levels were subsequently determined by microarray analysis Genes were assigned to the inducible class if their mRNA levels increased more than fourfold by PI in 3 hours As shown in Figure 5a a substantial proportion 44 of the inducible genes had mRNA half lives shorter than 2 hours By contrast only 11 of the non inducible class of genes had mRNA half lives less than 2 hours and more than 70 of these genes had mRNA half lives longer than 6 hours P 0 001 Figure 5a This result confirmed in an independent cellular system the observation that transcriptionally inducible genes preferentially encode rapidly degraded mRNAs We next investigated the functional characteristics of the genes assigned to each mRNA turnover class Figure 5b More than one third of genes regulating apoptosis were both inducible and had mRNA half lives of less than 2 hours By contrast only 10 of the genes encoding cell surface proteins were in this class The apoptosis regulators included several anti apoptotic genes discussed previously A20 MCL1 c IAP2 as well as potentially pro apoptotic genes such as those for Fas ligand and TNF receptor type II PHLDA1 is the human homolog of TDAG51 a pleckstrin homology domain protein that may modulate apoptosis by regulating Fas ligand expression following stimulation through the T cell receptor It is well known that apoptosis in T lymphocytes is an elaborately orchestrated process following lymphocyte activation that allows clonal expansion of the activated T cells while eventually eliminating the clone through the process of activation induced cell death 30 Thus anti apoptotic gene products are required early during lymphocyte activation whereas attenuation of the clonal burst eventually requires pro apoptotic signaling through Fas and the TNF receptors This change in apoptotic responsiveness may be accomplished rapidly by combining transcriptional regulation with rapid mRNA turnover of key apoptosis regulatory genes Transcriptional reprogramming following lymphocyte activation involves the coordinate induction of transcription factors 31 and many of these were found to have labile mRNAs Figure 5b Several of these genes are known to encode immediate early transcription factors for example FosB NAB2 ATF 3 NOT1 that are induced by a wide range of cellular stimuli and this class of transcription factors is well known to have unstable mRNAs 32 Other inducible transcription factors with labile mRNAs have more lymphocyte specific functions such as IRF 4 a factor that is required for lymphocyte activation but is not required in other lineages 33 Not surprisingly the most inducible class of genes in PBMCs encoded cytokines chemokines and their receptors Figure 5c Within this class more than 25 of genes had mRNA half lives of less than 2 hours As expected many cytokine mRNAs were both rapidly inducible and rapidly degraded Figure 5d Unexpectedly the chemokine genes had much more stable mRNAs than the cytokine genes even though they were strongly induced by PI treatment Figure 5d The mRNAs for the cytokine and chemokine receptors also differed in their stability The inducible chemokine receptors CCR1 and CXCR5 had labile mRNAs whereas most of the inducible cytokine receptors IL 2 IL 3 IL 6 receptor chains had relatively stable mRNAs The differential mRNA stabilities of cytokines chemokines and their receptors reflect their divergent biological functions Cytokines potently induce activation and differentiation of target cells in a tightly regulated temporal fashion during immune responses 34 To limit inappropriate effects of cytokines both temporally and spatially on bystander cells the levels of these factors must be modulated rapidly which can be achieved given their short mRNA half lives On the other hand chemokines are chemoattractants that signal leukocyte migration by setting up concentration gradients that are recognized by chemokine receptors 35 The inducible chemokines are used in inflammatory responses and wound healing to attract the appropriate complement of immune cells to the affected tissues These cellular reactions need to be rapidly initiated but are slowly resolved a kinetic profile that can be understood in light of the relative stability of chemokine mRNAs Finally we investigated whether known cis acting mRNA motifs could account for the mRNA turnover rates measured in the present study Adenylate uridylate rich elements AREs mediate rapid turnover of some mRNAs Three different classes of ARE have been defined two of which include the core motif AUUUA 13 A recent bioinformatics analysis of labile mRNAs with AUUUA motifs extended this core motif to the nonamer UAUUUAWW and a database of mRNAs that have matches to this motif in their 3 untranslated regions was created 36 Using this database we examined the distribution of these AU rich motifs among the classes of mRNAs with different half lives Figure 6shows that this motif was found preferentially in the most unstable mRNAs and was observed with decreasing frequency in mRNAs with longer half lives Nonetheless 10 of the genes in the long half life category 8 hours contained AREs demonstrating that the ARE motif is not completely predictive of rapid mRNA turnover Furthermore many of the RNAs with unstable mRNAs lacked the ARE consensus motif suggesting that other cis elements may be responsible for their rapid degradation Conclusions The systematic determination of mRNA degradation rates described in the present report revealed an underlying logic that relates gene function and mRNA stability The largest category of genes found to have unstable mRNAs included genes that were inducible by various cellular signaling events The inducibility of many of these genes is known to be due to transcriptional activation of their promoters Thus the rapid degradation of these mRNAs allows their levels to rapidly drop when transcriptional activation is terminated By categorizing genes using the functional properties of their encoded proteins we found that certain functional classes were relatively enriched for unstable mRNAs Two such classes the cytokine genes and immediate early transcription factor genes were previously known to have unstable mRNAs The class of apoptosis regulators however was not previously known to be enriched for labile mRNAs However given the need to rapidly modulate apoptosis during development cellular differentiation and immune responses this property of the apoptotic genes can be readily understood Another unanticipated finding was that many critical regulators of M phase of the cell cycle had rapidly degraded mRNAs In light of the short duration of M phase these labile M phase regulators may need to be eliminated rapidly to allow correct entry into G1 phase of the cell cycle The initial impetus of this research was to understand the mechanism of action of the anti cancer drug flavopiridol The regulatory logic of mRNA degradation revealed in this study gives us insight into how this general transcriptional inhibitor can have selective toxicity for tumor cells In particular the short half lives of mRNAs encoding M phase proteins and other key cell cycle regulators for example c Myc may contribute to the cytotoxicity of flavopiridol for cancer cells but may also contribute to the dose limiting toxicity of flavopiridol for gut epithelium leading to secretory diarrhea 16 However the present results also suggest that flavopiridol may be more effective in treating certain types of cancer cells that are highly dependent on genes with unstable mRNAs For example OCI Ly3 lymphoma cells constitutively express two anti apoptotic BCL 2 family members A1 and MCL1 which are not expressed at high levels in normal lymphocytes The instability of the A1 and MCL1 mRNAs therefore may contribute to the toxicity of flavopiridol for these lymphoma cells Gene expression profiling demonstrated that the OCI Ly3 cell line is an excellent model for the activated B like DLBCL subtype 1 Indeed fresh lymphoma biopsies from such patients revealed high expression of A1 and MCL1 in most cases 1 These results suggest that activated B like DLBCL might be a particularly attractive candidate disease for new clinical trials of flavopiridol Materials and methods Chemicals and cells Flavopiridol and 9 nitropaullone were obtained from

criteria First the mRNA abundance at X h as measured by the ratio of the array element Cy5 Cy3 must have decreased by at least twofold Second the average of the geometric means for the array element at the later time points for example Z1 Z2 and Z3 must be less than the twofold decrease of that element at the indicated time point Third the average of the geometric means for previous time points for example Y1 and Y2 must be greater than the twofold decrease of that element at the indicated time point The expression data for array elements representing the same gene were averaged Hierarchical clustering was performed using Cluster software and visualized using the Tree View software 40 ARE mRNA database The accession numbers of transcripts with one to five copies of AUUUA were downloaded from the ARE mRNA database 41 These transcripts were categorized by their half lives according to the PBMC database Mathematical analysis of mRNA half lives A first order kinetic model would imply that the log ratio of Cy5 to Cy3 would decrease linearly with time For each gene we fitted a linear regression model of the log ratios to the time points where the model included a separate intercept
