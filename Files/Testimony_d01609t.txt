and reshape the agency reengineerour business processes and train and equip our staff withuptodate technology to help meet Congress current and futureneeds Congressional mandates and requests continue to representover  percent of our work and our workload and productivityremain at nearrecord levels Our budget request represents ourneedsnot wantsto sustain this level of effort and support tothe CongressSince becoming the Comptroller General at the beginning offiscal year  GAOs appropriations have been insufficient tofund mandatory and inflation expenses associated with employeecompensation and benefits and make needed investments in criticalareas such as technology training and performance recognitionWe have managed our resource shortages by reducing our staffinglevels and underfunding critical investments We cannot and shouldnot continue this trendThe funds we are requesting are essential to helping us remainprepared to meet the complex controversial and multidimensionalissues and challenges confronting the Congress now and in thefuture Our request includes only those funds we need to stabilizeat our approved  fulltime equivalent staffing level and toincrementally increase investments needed in training technologyperformance recognition and other key support items to a levelconsistent with best practices of other comparable government andprivate sector entitiesBefore I begin detailing our fiscal year  budget needs Iwould like to highlight some of GAOs accomplishments andachievements in fiscal year  and the major challengesconfronting usA REVIEW OF GAOS FISCAL YEAR  ACCOMPLISHMENTSGAO had a tremendous year in fiscal year  As a result ofactions taken on our work by the Congress and federal departmentsand agencies taxpayers benefited from over  billion infinancial savingsa  return on every  invested in GAO Ourwork also resulted in significant improvements in governmentoperations and services that will benefit all Americans Amongother things by acting on our recommendations the governmentimproved public health and safety strengthened national securitybetter protected consumers and improved its financial managementand information systems We also contributed critical informationto public debates on Social Security and Medicare reform and calledattention to looming problems such as the security of governmentcomputer systems and the knowledge and skills needed in the federalworkforce in coming years Other indicators of our performancesuch as the number of testimonies our senior executives providedand recommendations implemented exceeded that of most recentyears I also am pleased to report that we made significantprogress toward addressing many of the organizational humancapital and information technology challenges that I outlined foryou at last years hearing We had a very busy and productiveyearTaxpayers Benefit from  Billion in Financial SavingsIn fiscal year  GAO helped achieve about  billion indirect financial benefits for the American taxpayer These benefitsare a result of the Congress or federal departments and agenciesimplementing our recommendations to make government services moreefficient improve the budgeting and spending of tax dollars andstrengthen the management of federal resources The estimatedfinancial benefits include budget reductions costs avoidedresources reallocated and revenue enhancements These resultsexceeded our target of  billion and were greater than that ofthe previous three fiscal years as illustrated in the followinggraphicDollars in billions                  TargetF is cal yearsSome examples of GAOs work that contributed to these financialsavings include the followingHelping to Prevent Fraud and Abuse in Medicare GAO had longadvocated increased funding specifically for activities to preventfraud and abuse in the Medicare program In the Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability andAccountability Actwhich provided the additional funding As a result of theseactivities the Medicareprograms net savings were about  billion in fiscal yearCutting Costs of the F Aircraft Program In a series ofreports beginning in the mids GAO questioned various aspects of the Air Forces Faircraft acquisitionprogram We reported that the acquisition strategy was risky andthat the program wasexperiencing cost growth manufacturing problems with testaircraft and testing delaysOur analysis helped the Congress reduce the final fiscal year appropriation requestfor the F by about  million and to identify conditionsthat should be met beforethe Department of Defense could begin full productionSupporting Oversight of the Internal Revenue Service IRS GAOcontinued to supportcongressional oversight of IRS operations including IRSimplementation of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act its budget requests andadministration of various taxfunctions For example our testimony on IRS broadbasedmodernization effortsprovided an integrated assessment of the challenges IRScontinues to face in its taxenforcement and customer service operations and itsmodernization of performancemanagement information systems and business practices At thesame time our workgenerated savings and potential reductions in taxpayer burdenOur work on theimproved use of information returns in IRS tax enforcementoperations yielded million in savings this year IRS also agreed to begin trackinginformation that has thepotential of clarifying its notices to taxpayers and easingtheir task in complying withthose noticesRecapturing Excess HUD Funding GAO identified funding fromseveral sources in theDepartment of Housing and Urban Developments budget includingunexpendedbalances no longer needed that could be recaptured in fiscalyears  and  TheCongress rescinded  billion from the Section  housingprograms fiscal year budget authority and rejected  billion of HUDs fiscal year request for housingassistance for a total reduction of  billion SubsequentlyGAO and HUD workedtogether to revise HUDs analysis to show that by usingrecaptured funds HUD hadsufficient funding to meet its needsAlmost  Actions Taken To Improve Government Operations orServicesGAOs recommendations and audit findings also resulted in orcontributed to many improvements in the effectiveness andefficiency of government operations and services during fiscal year While immeasurable in dollar terms they contributed toimproving public safety and consumer protection establishing moreeffective and efficient government operations and safeguarding thenations physical and information infrastructure We recorded actions taken in response to our recommendations to improve how thefederal government operates a number far exceeding that of thepreceding  years as illustrated in the following graphic    Number of actions      TargetFiscal yearExamples of GAOs work that resulted in these accomplishmentsfollowImproving Nursing Home Quality of Care The Health CareFinancing Administration HCFA and several statesincludingCalifornia Maryland and Michiganimproved their oversight andenforcement of nursing homes quality of care standards in responseto GAOs recommendations highlighting weaknesses in existingprocesses Improvements included increased funding for nursing homesurveyors more prompt investigation of complaints alleging seriousharm to residents more immediate enforcement actions for homeswith repeated serious problems a reorganization of HCFAs regionalstaff to improve consistency in oversight and increased fundingfor administrative law judges to reduce the backlog of appealedenforcement actionsManaging Wildfire Prevention Federal Experts Saw MassiveWildfires Coming read an August   news headline Thearticle was referring to GAOs April  report on wildfiresSince then GAO has used the increased risk of uncontrollable andoften catastrophic wildfires as an example of the need forstrategic budgeting to address issues that are not aligned withthe current budget and organizational structures of the four majorfederal land management agencies Responding to the wildfires thatburned over  million acres of public and private land in the Congress appropriated an additional  million in fiscal year to reduce hazardous fuels in highrisk locations wherewildlands and urban areas meet GAO testified on the need for thefour land management agencies to act quickly to develop a frameworkto spend funds effectively and to account accurately for what theyaccomplish with the fundsImproving Human Capital Practices Our work on human capitalissues helped focus the attention of the executive and legislativebranches on the importance of these issuesparticularly in managing for results We helped spur theadministration to make humancapital a priority management objective in the fiscal year budget submission andour framework for human capital selfassessment is being used atother agenciesincluding the Social Security Administration Small BusinessAdministration NationalAeronautics and Space Administration and EnvironmentalProtection Agency Theframework also is used throughout GAO to help guide our researchand developmentwork and our congressionally driven examinations of how wellagencies are pursuingstrategic human capital management in support of their missionsand goals We havedesignated strategic human capital management as one of thefederal governments highrisk areas in our  Performance and Accountability Series andHighRisk UpdateStrengthening Information Security GAO has evaluated thesecurity of criticalinformation systems at federal agencies and recommended numerousimprovementsmost recently at three Treasury agencies the Department ofEnergy Department ofVeterans Affairs and the Environmental Protection Agency InSeptember  GAOissued a governmentwide perspective on federal informationsecurity that coveredInspector General and GAO audit findings reported since July We concluded thatweak security continues to be a widespread problem that placescritical and sensitivefederal operations at risk of tampering disruption andinappropriate disclosure InOctober  government information security reform provisionswere enacted into lawto strengthen information security practices throughout thegovernmentStabilizing the Balkans Despite the presence of two largeforces led by the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization the Balkans remain volatile GAOswork has shown thatthe international operations in Bosnia and Kosovo face severeobstacles to achievingenduring peace and stability Most local leaders and members oftheir respective ethnicgroups have not embraced the political and social reconciliationneeded to buildmultiethnic democratic societies Our work also has shown thatthe internationalcommunity has not provided the resources that the United Nationsmission in Kosovosays it needs particularly for building a civilian policeforce If progress is not madewith these matters violence may escalate or armed conflict mayresultRequests for GAO Testimony and Implementation ofRecommendations IncreasedIn fiscal year  the number of times that GAOs seniorexecutives testified before the Congress and the rate at which ourrecommendations were implemented exceeded that of most recentyears Because GAOs primary function is to support the Congress incarrying out its decisionmaking and oversight responsibilitiesthe number of times our experts testify before congressional panelseach year is an indicator of our responsiveness and reflects theimpact importance and value of our work In fiscal year  GAOofficials testified  times before  different House and SenateCommittees and Subcommittees more than half of all congressionalcommittees and subcommittees Our experts testified on a broadrange of issues of national importance including arms controlhealth care Social Security human capital nuclear waste cleanupwildfire prevention aviation safety and security internationaltrade computer security financial management and reform andbudget issuesOur assistance to the Congress at public hearings continues toremain high as illustrated below However it is clear that thenumber of congressional oversight hearings and other GAO testimonyopportunities will decline significantly in fiscal year  as aresult of factors beyond our control Among these include the slowstart of the th Congress due to the power sharing arrangementsin the Senate closer margins and committee leadership changes inthe House and delay in filling many Bush Administration policypositionsNumber of testimonies         TargetFiscal yearWe also exceeded our performance of previous years with respectto the rate at which the recommendations we made  years ago wereimplemented We use a year interval because our historical datashow that agencies often need time to take action on ourrecommendations By the end of fiscal year   percent of therecommendations we made in fiscal year  had been implementedAs illustrated in the graphic below this rate exceeds that of thepreceding  years Implemented recommendations correct theunderlying causes of problems weaknesses in internal controlsfailures to comply with laws or regulations or other mattersimpeding effective and efficient performancePercent of recom m en dations im plem ented          TargetFiscal yearSignificant Progress Made Addressing Management and OperationalIssuesLast

issues within the agency I am pleased to report thatwe made significant progress toward addressing many of theseissuesWe continued to enhance our effectiveness and efficiency througha variety of means during fiscal year  including issuing astrategic plan establishing congressional protocols realigningthe agency implementing key human capital initiatives andincreasing the use of information

primarily designed to better align our resources with ourstrategic plan eliminate a layer of managerial hierarchy reducethe number of organizational units increase internal and externalcoordination activities with the Congress and other accountabilityorganizations clarify the roles and responsibilities ofmanagement increase the number of personnel who perform ratherthan manage or review work and increase the critical mass andenhance the flexibility of field resourcesWe also began implementing a range of new and enhanced humancapital and information technology strategies to position GAO

improvingour operations and processes in fiscal year  We implementedtwo new management strategies risk management and matrixmanagement GAOs risk management approach allows management toidentify and involve key stakeholders throughout an engagement totranscend traditional organizational boundaries to maximizeinstitutional value and minimize related risks GAOs matrixmanagement approach maximizes our value to the Congress byleveraging the knowledge skills and experience of all employeesto ensure the highest quality products and services and to help theCongress address the challenging complex multidimensionalproblems facing the nationThroughout fiscal year  we also continued to improve ouruse of information technology as a tool for productivity andknowledge management To provide our teams of analysts with amechanism for simplifying and standardizing their work we launchedthe Electronic Assistance Guide for Leading Engagementsthe EAGLEwhich is a prototype of a comprehensive Webbased guide toconducting GAO engagements We also continued to enhance thecapabilities of our computer network and successfully made oursystems YK compliant In addition we began a number of projectson enabling technologies including software upgrades thedeployment of notebook computers and improved remote access toallow teams to work more efficiently in the field Also to carryout GAOs responsibilities under the Presidential Transition Act of we developed a separate section on our Internet web site withlinks to key GAO contacts and reports on the major executive branchagencies which was completed at the beginning of fiscal yearFISCAL YEAR  PLANS AND FUTURE CHALLENGESDuring fiscal year  we will continue to focus our work onthe major issues facing the Congress including Social Securitysolvency education economic development Medicare reformnational security international affairs and government managementreforms and computer security Another top priority this year willbe working with leaders on the Hill to help the Congress strengthenits approach to oversight with an emphasis on looking hard at whatgovernment does how it does it and the longterm consequences oftodays policy choices GAOs  Performance and AccountabilitySeries and HighRisk Update will serve as a solid foundation forcongressional oversight Also as I mentioned earlier we haveseveral key initiatives in progress to improve how we serve theCongress among them an expanded client feedback system protocolsgoverning our dealings with federal agencies new highleveladvisory bodies to gain the expertise of business leaders formerCabinet officials and other experts and new avenues for sharingour own expertise with other accountability organizationsWe also are preparing to carry out two new responsibilitiesmandated by the previous Congress We will chair a panel to reviewthe governments A process for obtaining services throughcompetitive sourcing Also if the needed funding is provided wewill review the costs and benefits of major regulations under theTruth in Regulating Act PL  Oct   We have arequest pending for  million in supplemental funding for fiscalyear  and are requesting  million for fiscal year  tomeet the requirements created by the Truth in Regulating ActInternally we will continue to emphasize initiatives to addressour two major management challenges human capital and informationtechnology With about  percent of our resources devoted to staffsalary and benefits the area of human capital presents a majorchallenge A significant percentage of our workforce is nearingretirement age while marketplace demographic economic andtechnological changes indicate that competition for skilled workerswill be greater in the future With our agency realigned tofacilitate our work for the Congress and new legislative authorityin hand to manage our workforce more effectively we are pursuingseveral initiatives to strengthen our human capital For examplewe are recruiting diverse highcaliber staff with the skills andabilities we need to achieve our strategic goals and objectives Wewill be putting into place a competencybased performance appraisalsystem and using the results of our staff knowledge and skillsinventory to help us in workforce planning We also havereestablished and are expanding training opportunities for ourstafffrom the senior executives to the new hiresAnother major management challenge is building an integrated andreliable information technology IT infrastructure that supportsthe achievement of our goals We are conducting a comprehensive ITreview to identify opportunities to increase our efficiencyeffectiveness and productivity We also are mapping our businessprocesses to our IT architecture and will link future ITinvestments to our business goals In addition we plan to continueinitiatives to increase our employees productivity maximize theuse of technology and enhance the Webbased knowledgesharingapplications on the desktop Last we also must heighten thesecurity of our networkFY  BUDGET REQUESTTo fully support the Congress as outlined in our strategic planand the additional congressional mandates received since itsissuance we are requesting a budget for fiscal year  of about million This funding level will allow us to support andstaff to our approved level of  fulltime equivalentpersonnel We will increase our emphasis on areas of congressionaland public interest and internally will continue to emphasizeinitiatives to address our two major management challenges humancapital and information technology Our request also includes million to carry out new responsibilities created by the Truth inRegulating Act In addition we are seeking a nominal increase inGAOs representation expenses from  to  toaccommodate our expanded role with both domestic and internationalaccountability organizationsAdditional funding in fiscal year  is being requestedformandatory pay and benefit costs resulting primarily from federalcostofliving and locality pay adjustments based on Office ofManagement and Budget OMB guidance increased participation inthe Federal Employees Retirement System and an increase in theestimated number of retireesuncontrollable inflationary increases in transportationlodging postage printing supplies contracts and otheressential mission support services based on OMBs percentinflation index and other factors anduncontrollable contract rate increases in building operationsand maintenance and information technologyprogramsFunding of  for salaries and benefits also is beingrequested to staff and support our approved  fulltimeequivalent staffing level We plan to use these resources toenhance our review efforts in areas of congressional and publicinterest and concern such as government computer security SocialSecurity solvency education economic development Medicarereform and international affairsThe additional funds requested also would be used to continueinitiatives begun in fiscal year  that are critical tosupporting the Congress and the goals and objectives identified inour strategic plan These initiatives include human capitalinitiatives and enabling technological advances to enhance theperformance and productivity of our workforce as followsHuman capital initiatives Enabling technologyinitiatives to increase employee productivity maximize the use oftechnology and enhance employee tools available at the desktopincluding such initiatives as reengineering business processesupgrading hardware and software applications expanding ourvideoconferencing capabilities and implementing a best practicesnetwork security programOther efforts includeEnhancing security and removing asbestos within the GAO Buildingto protect the health and safety of our most important assetourstaffUpgrading GAOs computer security facility to ensure ourcontinued ability to conduct effective comprehensive computersecurity controls testing of complex

related corruptionaround the world multilateral training efforts with easternblocand selected South and Latin American countries and bilateralassistance to Russia andContracting for the development of a requirements document to beused along with other legislative branch agencies to jointlyprocure and share a common financial managementsystemIn addition as previously mentioned we are requesting million to provide the annual funding requirement specified in theTruth in Regulating ActBUDGET REQUEST CRITICAL TO SUSTAINING EXISTING LEVEL OF SERVICETO THE CONGRESSThe resources we are requesting for fiscal year  arecritical to addressing our human capital and information technologychallenges and ensuring our ability to effectively meet theincreasing congressional requests for GAO services We have reacheda point that if sufficient funding is not received to address theseissues and properly support our staff we will need to take actionsthat will negatively impact our service and responsiveness to theCongressCongressional demand for GAO services continues to increase Forexample as illustrated below the number of engagements begun as aresult of a congressional request has increased during the past years These numbers do not include hundreds of other requests thathad not yet been startedWe have worked hard over the past  years with availableresources to significantly increase our productivity levels tosuccessfully meet increasing congressional demand For example werealigned our organization reengineered many of our businessprocesses retooled our engagement and risk management practicesrevised our performance appraisal and recognition systems andupdated our information technology infrastructure However we havereached a point that significant additional productivity gains areunlikely without sufficient funding to further enhance our humancapital and information technology programsWe are concerned about our ability to continue to increase ourproductivity levels sustain our return on investment and meetfuture congressional demands given the recent trend in our fundinglevels Since becoming the Comptroller General at the beginning offiscal year  I have not asked for any increase in our approved fulltime equivalent staffing level I have only requestedthe funding necessary to properly maintain and support thisstaffing level and cover mandatory expenses including inflationand compensation costs However as illustrated in the followinggraphic the funding GAO received has been significantly less thanwhat we requested and needed to support our approved staffinglevelIn order to cover our mandatory expenses during the past years we had to staff well below our approved staffing level asillustrated below and delayed or made reduced investments inimportant human capital and information technology initiatives Asa result of these funding shortfalls and the mandated fundingreductions in the mids our training performancebasedrecognition and rewards programs are not where they need to beConsequently we are at a competitive disadvantage with theexecutive branch in some areas such as performance rewards Inaddition we have some management information systems that areobsolete and incapable of interfacing within our networkenvironment and a variety of software that needs to be upgraded toensure continued vendor maintenance and support We cannot continuedown this path We have reached the point at which investments inthese critical programs and other areas must be made in order toeffectively support our staff and provide the high level of serviceexpected and required by the Congress      Fiscal year FTEs RequestedFTEs UsedThe funds we are requesting are critical to addressing oursuccession planning challenges and enhancing the knowledge skillsand abilities of our workforce A large percentage of our workforcewill become eligible for retirement within the next  years Morethan  percent of our analysts and  percent of our seniorexecutives will be retirement eligible within that time period Weneed to aggressively continue our efforts to hire new staffdevelop existing staff and otherwise build the future GAO Inorder to be competitive in attracting hiring and retaining highcaliber and talented staff we need to be able to further enhanceour human capital programs Thus the funding we are requesting fortraining performancebased recognition and compensation programseducation loan repayments mass transit subsidy allowance andenabling technology is critical Without such funding we will notbe competitive in attracting and retaining the best brightest andexpertise needed to effectively serve the Congress in addressingthe complex controversial and multidimensional issues andchallenges it faces each yearIf the funding trend of the past  years is continued we willneed to restrict our work to only responding to requests fromcommittees and subcommittees thus severely limitingandpotentially eliminatingwork done for individual members Such arestriction also would further reduce the limited flexibility wehave to research and develop expertise on emerging issues therebylimiting our ability to respond to the Congress when related issuesarise on short notice For example were it not for the advanceresearch and development work we had done on computer securityChina the World Trade Organization and last years presidentialelection issues we would have been unable to be responsive to thecongressional requests and public debates on these real time eventdriven issues We need sufficient funding to build and ensure wehave the capacity and expertise to address such emerging issues onshort notice in the futuresETFforebmuNCONCLUDING REMARKSFiscal year  was a tremendous year of accomplishment andachievement for GAO  a year of great service to the Congress andof great benefit to the American taxpayer We have made significantprogress in addressing many of the areas in need of improvement inGAO and need to continue these efforts The resources we arerequesting for fiscal year  are critical to sustaining ourhighlevel of performance and service to the Congress We are thenations and possibly the worlds leading accountabilityorganization We need these additional resources to continue ourefforts to further strengthen GAO and be a model organization forthe rest of the federal government and accountability organizationsaround the world In addition given GAOs impressive results andreturn on investment it only makes sense for GAO to receiveresource allocations that are well above average for other federalentities To do otherwise would send a troubling message to GAOsemployees the press and the publicWe look forward to your continued support and working even moreclosely with you and your staff this year and in fiscal year This concludes my statement I would be pleased to respond to anyquestions that the Members of the Subcommittee may haveOrders by InternetFor information on how to access GAO reports on the Internetsend an email message with info in the body toinfowwwgaogovor visit GAOs World Wide Web home page
