 November 4 1992 Name Address City ST Zip Dear Name Here we are the Department of Communication and Theatre and there you are an alum of the Department Yet in the midst of all our activity over the years many of us have NOT COMMUNICATED at least not with one another Under separate cover Dr Bruce Wagener recently sent a mailing to you in order to confirm your current educational and occupational status your ongoing involvements and interests and future plans you might have Our records in that regard are fragmentary at best Most recently we received results of an employment survey of 1990 91 graduates conducted by IUPUI s Career and Employment Services it was pleasing to learn that we had nearly twice as many graduates as any other department in the School of Liberal Arts A proportionately large number of you responded to that survey But it is high time that we establish direct contact with all alumni from all the graduation years from all Department activities and areas That is why as Dr Wagener indicated departmental newsletters soon will be forthcoming sharing information on alumni as well as happenings in the Department Recently a project arose that should be interesting to you as a former student who struggled to clear the financial hurdle of education We were generously offered 1 000 toward the establishment of our Department s first scholarship program It was given as a start toward a goal of a 10 000 alumni scholarship fund That fund would allow us to grant a 500 scholarship annually to meritorious applicants with financial need Here is where you can help The 10 000 is a highly commendable goal which can be realized through contributions in whatever amount you can give As you probably well know the resources provided by such scholarships might well determine whether or not promising students can continue their education Please use the enclosed postage paid envelope to make your gift I might add that a gift of 400 qualifies you for recognition in the School of Liberal Arts Dean s Council a critical group of supporters whose generosity does a lot to advance the calibre of the School Whether the tax deductible gift you can give is for 400 or 40 or 10 I urge you to join us as we build better ways to help our students NOW OUR FIRST INVITATION TO YOU We invite each contributor and her his guest to attend our annual Department Reception for Graduating Seniors and Their Guests In this way you can be recognized and thanked in person while visiting with faculty and students The reception is held on the same day as the School of Liberal Arts Honors Convocation The 1992 reception was by far our biggest and best it was held on campus during the hours immediately preceding School activities Our 1993 reception will be April 16 Please note that on your calendar Specifics will be sent to you once the menu and plans have been finalized and invitations printed We look forward to hearing from you and interacting more frequently in the future Sincerely Robert C Dick Ph D Professor and Chairperson
