 The Asian About Face It s good I suppose always to be right It s so good in fact that it s worth revising your past positions when they suddenly look wrong The key to success in this endeavor of course is never to let on that you ve changed your mind at all For an object lesson in how to do this look no further than what s happened to our understanding of Asia in light of its seven months of economic chaos The meaning of the Asia crisis has been self evident to those who believe that the free market can do no wrong The collapse of Asian stock markets and banking systems has proven that industrial policy doesn t work that protectionism is a route to disaster and state control of credit allocation encourages inefficiency and corruption In other words what s happened in Asia is proof that until the rest of the world becomes more like us it s bound to struggle Thus Paul Craig Roberts argues in a recent issue of Business Week that industrial policy fostered appalling investment banking and monetary practices and that Asia s woes prove that Ronald Reagan was right and his critics were wrong Of course everything Roberts writes purports to show that Reagan was right and his critics were wrong The Economist holds up Korea as an example of the inevitable failure of any economy bossed by civil servants while economist Rudi Dornbusch describes Korea s problems as a crisis of statism The op ed pages of the Wall Street Journal meanwhile have wallowed in triumphalist glee with free marketeers dancing happily on the grave of what used to be called the Asian miracle Even on its own terms this analysis is startlingly cynical After all until June the world s investors which is to say the market saw nothing but blue skies ahead for these economies They showed their faith by shoving billions into Asian equity markets while foreign banks contentedly handed out billions in loans If Asia s problems are systemic and the result of these countries statist policies then investors failure to recognize this earlier is a strike against the market not for it Still more perverse is that even as the free marketeers conclude that history is rendering its verdict on the Asian model of capitalism they seem to forget that until the recent crisis they themselves took great pains to deny that such a model existed Until Asia fell apart supply siders happily held it up as proof that the only recipe for economic growth was open markets and nonintervention on the part of the state Asian economies weren t like those feeble Latin American economies with their high tariffs easy credit and corruption Instead they were models of macroeconomic stability market driven pricing and disciplined borrowing In 1995 the Heritage Foundation released its index of economic freedom Four of the top seven countries were Asian including Japan and Taiwan All the Asian countries now struggling qualified as free Taiwan and Korea succeeded the Economist explained at the start of this decade because they had among the least price distorting regimes in the world Within the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund similar conclusions about the sources of Asian growth prevailed The chief economist of the World Bank s East Asian desk authored a 1993 book downplaying the presence of industrial policy in the region while a concluded that rapid growth in each economy was primarily due to the application of a set of common market friendly economic policies Just last year economist called the East Asian economies highly market oriented with a long period of relatively free trade and limited distortions from government regulations while arguing that most East Asian countries did not rely on industrial policy at all The market friendly interpretation of Asia s success was intended to counter the thesis offered by the Japanese by U S protectionists and by certain neo institutionalist economists that trade barriers subsidized credit and strong state support for export driven industries had been essential to the development of Asian economies Up till now everyone right and left has been anxious to claim the Asian example for their own for one reason Since World War II the Asian tigers are the only examples of successful sustained development over many decades Well OK Mauritius and Botswana have done well too If they achieved that success through targeted subsidies and controlled credit that certainly puts a crimp in free market theorists plans for Latin America and Africa Alternatively if they ve done so through free trade and low government spending then Milton Friedman can applaud That certain of these countries most notably Korea Japan and Taiwan relied heavily on market distorting devices is indisputable That these countries grew at historically rapid rates for more than two decades is also indisputable But the conclusion that the one led to the other is not indisputable It may very well be wrong Similarly while Hong Kong and Singapore have been remarkably open free market countries the fact that this is responsible for their rapid growth is hardly indisputable either The problem is that as economist Alwyn Young has pointed out in a thesis popularized by Slate s own Paul Krugman while Asia s growth rates in total production have been incredibly high its growth rates in worker productivity have Japan aside been surprisingly low In the postwar years all the Asian tigers have enjoyed enormously high savings rates rapid increases in the percentage of people participating in the work force excellent education and enormous investments in physical capital In other words they ve done a brilliant job of mobilizing resources but not a brilliant job of mobilizing resources efficiently But you can mobilize resources under very different regimes and just how the Asian tigers did it turns out to be hard to answer within the confines of an industrial policy vs free market argument Click for some examples of the complexity What s appalling is not that supply siders once argued that the tigers were proof of the free market s virtues There was a reasonable if hardly decisive case to be made for that point What s appalling is rather that now that their heroes have stumbled they have disowned them so utterly The irony is that if anything Asia is much more integrated into the global marketplace today than it was 10 or even five years ago After all it was foreign capitalists and not Asian governments who lent all those now floundering companies 500 billion in the last five years For more on that point click But what Asia s newfound critics once loved they now despise One can only imagine the heads I win tails you lose contortions these thinkers would have offered for America s woes in 1929 And while the comparison may be a bit facile it helps illuminate the crucial point about revisionist interpretations of Asia which is that they fail to recognize that one can believe in the virtues of the market while still understanding that markets sometimes fail
