 Background Thymocyte development occurs within a complex network of cells extracellular matrix and secreted factors referred to as the thymic microenvironment 1 Current evidence suggests that this microenvironment is created during fetal thymus organogenesis through stage dependent interactions between differentiating thymic epithelial cells TECs and developing thymocytes 2 3 4 5 6 Therefore blocks at different stages of thymocyte development result in differential effects on TEC differentiation and function Because of the complex interdependence of TEC and thymocyte differentiation defects in fetal TEC development can be caused either directly by cell autonomous TEC differentiation defects or indirectly by defective thymocyte maturation Once a mature thymic environment is formed many if not all stages of thymocyte maturation require interactions with thymic epithelial cells Therefore defects in TECs can in turn cause defects in thymocyte differentiation proliferation or cell death Thymocyte differentiation undergoes two main transitions The first is from the CD3 4 8 triple negative TN to the CD4 8 double positive DP stages During this transition T cell precursors sequentially gain and lose cell surface expression of CD44 and CD25 markers express the pre T cell receptor pTCR and undergo selection 2 7 8 9 The other transition is from CD4 8 DP to CD4 or CD8 single positive SP thymocytes in which DP cells express CD3 rearrange their TCR undergo positive and negative selection and down regulate CD4 or CD8 to become functional CD8 or CD4 SP T cells 10 11 In addition to functional and cell surface marker changes each thymocyte differentiation stage is marked by characteristic changes in proliferation and apoptosis 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 The most well defined role for TECs in directly affecting thymocyte differentiation is to mediate positive selection via expression of MHC molecules 11 19 20 21 22 However it is still unclear whether TECs directly promote specific stages of thymocyte differentiation during stages that do not involve MHC TCR interactions or whether their role at other stages is primarily to promote cell growth and or survival Cytokines produced by TECs have been shown to promote proliferation in early stages of thymocyte development and have been proposed to regulate apoptosis and differentiation although their precise roles remain controversial 23 24 TECs have also been shown to promote thymocyte proliferation in SP cells after selection has occurred 15 However a defined role for TECs at the TN DP transition remains elusive Much of the research on this transition has focused on the role of the pre TCR Mounting evidence suggests that the pre TCR does not require interaction with a ligand to perform its function and the subsequent CD44 25 TN4 or pre DP to DP transition has been termed programmed differentiation to indicate that this step can occur in isolated thymocytes presumably without input from extrinsic signals 25 26 27 However there is also evidence that the thymic microenvironment does contribute signals required for the TN DP transition particularly to promote thymocyte proliferation and apoptosis 13 28 29 30 The specific nature and purpose of the TEC contribution during this important transition therefore remains to be determined In order to investigate the regulation of thymocyte development by TECs we are studying Hoxa3 Pax1 compound mutant mice Hoxa3 and Pax1 are transcription factors that act in a common pathway regulating thymus organogenesis and thymic epithelial cell development 29 31 32 33 34 Hoxa3 Pax1 compound mutants have defects in TEC development including reduced numbers of TECs fewer MHC Class II TECs and changes in TEC proliferation and apoptosis These TEC defects result in thymocyte maturation defects that include a decrease in total thymocyte number and a 10 fold reduction in the number of DP thymocytes but an apparently normal transition from the TN3 to the pre DP stage The decrease in DP cells is associated with increased apoptosis in both pre DP and DP cells 29 As the defects at the TN to DP transition in these mutants are caused by defective TEC function rather than thymocyte intrinsic defects these mice represent an opportunity to study the role of TECs in promoting this transition To further investigate the role of TECs in promoting thymocyte death and growth during the TN to DP transition we assayed the proliferation of specific thymocyte subsets using BrdU incorporation which detects cycling cells in S phase We compared fetal and adult wild type mice with Hoxa3 Pax1 compound mutants 29 34 We also assayed Rag1 mice which have defects in TEC development due to arrested thymocyte maturation at the TN3 stage 35 We found stage specific differences in proliferation levels between fetal and adult wild type thymocytes We also found distinct patterns of thymocyte proliferation in the Rag1 and Hoxa3 Pax1 mutants The abnormal cell death and proliferation patterns in the Hoxa3 Pax1 compound mutant fetal thymocytes might be caused in part by observed reductions in the transcription levels of the cytokines IL 7 and SCF produced by TECs Our results support a critical role for microenvironment created by TECs in regulating thymocyte proliferation during the TN to DP transition and show that this function is disrupted in Hoxa3 Pax1 compound mutants Results Thymocyte proliferation patterns are different in fetal and adult wild type mice As an initial analysis we compared thymocyte proliferation between thymocytes from late fetal E17 5 and adult 6 8 week wild type C57BL6 J mice Although differences in the proliferation of fetal vs adult TCR expressing thymocytes and have been reported 36 we were interested in investigating the more immature thymocyte subsets BrdU labeled fetal and adult thymi were analyzed for the percent of proliferating cells in different CD3 4 8 TN thymocyte subsets defined by CD44 and CD25 expression 8 The CD3 4 8 population was defined by co staining of all three markers Fig 1A A typical analysis of the BrdU cells in DP cells and the four CD44 vs CD25 subsets within the TN cell population is shown in Figure 1 Compiled data for each subset from all experiments is shown in Table 1 The wild type adult Fig 1C 1F and fetal Fig 1D 1F thymocyte proliferation profile patterns differed significantly at specific stages The overall proliferation level in TN cells was increased by 50 in fetal thymocytes p 0 01 Most dramatically the percentages of BrdU cells in fetal thymocytes were 10 fold higher than in the adult at the earliest TN1 CD44 25 thymocyte differentiation stage P 0 001 A much lower but still significant increase was seen in fetal TN2 cells 25 increase p 0 01 Proliferation was also significantly higher at the fetal TN3 stage compared to adult 50 increase p 0 01 Proliferation at the TN4 pre DP CD44 25 stage was similar between fetal and adult thymocytes In contrast DP cells showed a 3 fold increase in proliferation in the fetal thymus relative to adult p 0 01 Therefore nearly every stage from the earliest TN to the DP stages showed significantly increased proliferation in fetal thymocytes relative to adults It was possible that the lower percentage of proliferating cells seen in the TN1 population in adults was due to an increased number of B cells and NK cells in the adult thymus which would not have been excluded in our initial analysis As this was one of the most striking differences seen between fetal and adult stages we repeated this analysis adding antibodies against B220 and NK1 1 to CD3 4 and 8 in the excluded gate Fig 1G 1H Even excluding these cell populations there is still a significantly lower percentage of proliferating cells in the TN1 population in the adult thymus than in the fetal thymus Fig 1I Therefore this difference is not due to different numbers of B and NK cells in the adult vs fetal thymus Rag1 fetal thymocytes have a stage specific increase in proliferation relative to wild type We also compared proliferation of fetal thymocytes from Rag1 mice to the results obtained from wild type mice Thymocytes in the adult Rag1 thymus have been previously shown to have overall lower levels of proliferation than adult wild type TN thymocytes 13 particularly at the TN3 stage 37 38 39 40 At fetal stages our results showed that proliferation also varied between thymocytes in the wild type and Rag1 thymus at discrete stages of thymocyte differentiation At the earliest TN1 stage thymocyte proliferation levels in Rag1 thymi were similar to fetal wild type cells Fig 1E 1F Table 1 At the TN2 stage fetal thymocytes from Rag1 mice had a proliferation level nearly twice that of wild type fetal thymocytes p 0 001 By the TN3 stage the percentage of proliferating Rag1 thymocytes had dropped slightly below that of wild type fetal thymocytes 30 decrease p 0 01 equal to wild type adult TN3 proliferation levels In addition the percentages of BrdU cells in TN1 and TN2 subsets in the Rag1 fetal thymus were significantly higher than those of the wild type adults P 0 001 These results with Rag1 fetal thymocytes contrast with thymocytes in the Rag adult which have much lower proliferation than wild type adult thymocytes at all stages of thymocyte differentiation 13 Thymocyte proliferation in Hoxa3 Pax1 thymocytes at the TN DP transition Our previous analysis of the Hoxa3 Pax1 compound mutant thymocyte phenotype showed a specific partial block at the TN to DP transition associated with increased apoptosis at both the TN4 pre DP and DP subsets and a 10 fold decrease in DP cell numbers 29 Using BrdU analysis we compared the proliferation of Hoxa3 Pax1 fetal thymocytes during the TN to DP transition compared to littermate controls Thymocyte proliferation levels for all genotypes Hoxa3 Pax1 Pax1 and Hoxa3 Pax1 were similar to wild type in all of the canonical TN1 TN4 stages Fig 2A 2B 2C Table 1 consistent with the normal percentages and cell numbers for these subpopulations previously reported 29 Recent papers by Penit et al have provided data from cell cycle analysis suggesting that a discrete CD44 25 lopopulation with a specific proliferation profile can be identified such that the transition from TN3 to DP can be further subdivided into CD25 hi CD25 lo and CD25 subsets 12 13 Analysis of proliferation using these more narrowly defined subsets still showed values similar to wild type in the CD44 25 losubset Fig 2D 2E 2F Table 2 In contrast the proliferation level of DP cells increased nearly 2 fold in compound mutants compared to wild type Fig 2C 2F Table 1 In spite of this increase in the percentage of proliferating cells the actual number of BrdU DP cells was reduced 4 fold compared to wild type in the compound mutants 15 03 8 73 10 4vs 61 94 32 12 10 4in wild type p 0 01 The numbers of proliferating cells at the pre DP stage were unchanged not shown Combined with our previous results this result shows that both increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation contribute to the decrease in DP cells in the Hoxa3 Pax1 compound mutants Unfortunately Hoxa3 Pax1 mice die at birth preventing analysis of thymocyte proliferation in adult compound mutants Cytokine production is decreased in the Hoxa3 Pax1 fetal thymus Cytokines produced by TECs are good candidates for mediating at least some of these changes in thymocyte proliferation and apoptosis in the Hoxa3 Pax1 compound mutants Using semi quantitative RT PCR we analyzed the expression of two cytokines that are produced by TECs IL 7 and SCF in pooled genotype matched E14 5 thymi Fig 3 Hoxa3 Pax1 compound mutants had decreased transcription of both cytokines relative to all other genotypes including Pax1 single mutants However Hoxa3 Pax1 compound mutants were not completely missing either cytokine analyzed and the magnitude of the decrease was variable between pools To test whether the changes in cytokine levels were responsible for the observed thymocyte development phenotypes we attempted to rescue these phenotypes by supplementation in fetal thymic organ culture FTOC E15 5 embryonic thymic lobes from individual embryos were cultured separately in FTOC with or without added IL 7 or SCF Cultures from control genotypes wild type Pax1 Hoxa3 Pax1 behaved as expected 41 42 43 44 45 46 with addition of IL 7 causing an increase in the percentage of DN cells and a corresponding decrease in DP cells while adding SCF had no significant effect on thymocyte development data not shown However to our surprise the two separated lobes from Hoxa3 Pax1 compound mutants did not always develop in predictable ways In fact separated lobes cultured under identical conditions in the absence of any added cytokines had widely differing results Changes in thymocyte cell number and differentiation after culture were highly variable for example cell numbers could differ stochastically after culture by as much as 10 fold between two lobes from the same compound mutant embryo This result was never obtained with separately cultured thymic lobes from any other genotype which always developed identically when cultured without cytokines This property of the compound mutant thymic lobes probably reflects phenotypic variability previously seen in our histological and gross morphological analysis of these mutants 29 34 Discussion In this study we have examined thymocyte proliferation in the fetal and adult wild type thymus Our results showed clear stage specific differences in wild type thymocyte proliferation depending on the developmental age of the microenvironment i e fetal vs adult We also analyzed two mutant strains that have either cell autonomous Hoxa3 Pax1 or non cell autonomous Rag1 TEC defects with blocks at different stages of thymocyte differentiation Abnormal TEC development in both of these mutant strains resulted in both increases and decreases in thymocyte proliferation in a stage specific manner rather than simply an overall reduced ability to promote proliferation There is considerable evidence that thymopoiesis differs in the fetal thymus during the initial creation of the microenvironment as opposed to adult thymus function reviewed in 47 Differences have been reported in responses to some cytokines in signaling at the TN DP transition in fetal compared to adult thymus and in proliferation of CD4 SP thymocytes 36 48 49 50 The proliferation profiles of both wild type and Rag fetal thymocytes support the hypothesis that fetal thymocyte maturation is fundamentally different from thymocyte development in the adult thymus The TN1 and DP stages both show increased proliferation in wild type fetal thymocytes compared to adults This difference at the TN1 stage is not due to the presence of more B or NK cells in the adult thymus Although it is formally possible that some other cell type may still be included in our TN1 population this analysis strongly suggests that TN1 cells have different proliferation profiles in fetal and adult thymus It has been well documented that thymocytes in adult Rag1 or Rag2 mutants have dramatically reduced proliferation compared to wild type particularly at the TN3 stage 37 38 39 40 and Penit et al reported 2 10 fold reductions at every stage of thymocyte development in Rag adults 13 Recent work by Petrie et al has shown that this reduced proliferation is not intrinsic to Rag mutant thymocytes but rather is secondary to thymic microenvironment defects in Rag mutants 37 Our results show that at fetal stages Rag mutant thymocytes have a proliferation profile that is much more similar to wild type thymocytes at the same stage with less than a 2 fold difference in the percentage of proliferating cells at any stage For example TN3 stage thymocytes in the Rag adult thymus have proliferation levels 3 fold below wild type thymus 13 37 while in the Rag fetal thymus TN3 cells are only 25 30 lower than in wild type fetal thymus Proliferation is not changed at all stages and is actually increased relative to wild type at the TN2 stage This increase at the TN2 stage may be due to the failure of TN2 cells to initiate TCR gene rearrangement at this stage which is normally associated with decreased proliferation Rag mutants have a profound thymocyte development block at the TN3 to TN4 preDP transition 51 During normal wild type fetal thymus development significant DP cell development does not occur until E16 5 in most genetic backgrounds As a result at E17 5 the thymic microenvironment in Rag mutants has not been exposed to abnormal thymocyte development for very long and has not yet developed the full phenotype seen in the steady state adult Rag mutant thymus 35 In the Hoxa3 Pax1 compound mutants cell autonomous TEC defects cause a partial block at the DN DP transition so thymocytes do progress to DP and SP stages albeit at reduced frequencies 29 TEC defects are seen as early as E12 5 in these mutants from the earliest stages of organogenesis 34 Therefore the TEC defects in these mice would be expected to have different effects on thymocyte proliferation than in Rag mutants In this study we found stage specific changes in thymocyte proliferation at the DP stage Our previous analysis reported decreased DP cell number and increased apoptosis in both the pre DP and DP stages in these mutants 29 DP cell numbers in both this and our previous study were decreased 10 fold in the Hoxa3 Pax1 compound mutants At first glance the increase in the percentage of proliferating cells at the DP stage appears contradictory to this phenotype However this increase actually corresponds to decreased numbers of proliferating DP cells compared to wild type In contrast pre DP cells did not have a change in the number or percentage of proliferating cells suggesting that the signals promoting proliferation of these cells is still present and that proliferation of DP and pre DP cells may be regulated independently Pre DP cells do have a three fold increase in apoptosis 29 suggesting that separate signals regulate proliferation and survival of these cells Combined with our previous data this result suggests that the decrease in DP cell numbers seen in the Hoxa3 Pax1 compound mutants is both due to an increase in the number of pre DP and DP cells undergoing apoptosis as well as a decrease in the number of proliferating DP Insufficiencies of multiple cytokines might be involved in the changes in proliferation and cell death at the CD44 25 and DP stages in Hoxa3 Pax1 compound mutants SCF and IL 7 are first expressed as early as E12 5 in the developing thymus well before significant thymocyte maturation takes place 52 53 Although the number of TECs is reduced by about 2 fold in Hoxa3 Pax1 compound mutants the number of thymocytes is reduced by a slightly greater amount around 3 fold 29 Therefore the reductions seen in cytokine message levels in the Hoxa3 Pax1 compound mutants are not secondary to decreased TEC numbers In fact these mutants should have a relative increase in the proportion of TECs making the reductions seen in cytokine levels in the mutant thymi even more striking The reduced expression of these cytokines in Hoxa3 Pax1 compound mutants could be an indirect effect of defective TEC differentiation or could be direct downstream targets since both Hoxa3 and Pax1 are expressed in fetal thymus 54 55 Comparison of the Hoxa3 Pax1 phenotype with those of cytokine mutants do not reveal many similarities 30 46 56 57 58 59 60 61 probably because of the simultaneous reductions in multiple cytokines in the Hoxa3 Pax1 mutants For example SCF and IL 7 have been shown to have synergistic functions 62 63 Therefore changes in multiple cytokines in Hoxa3 Pax1 mutants would be expected to have complex effects on thymocyte development that could be difficult to predict Interpretation of the observed phenotype is further complicated by the fact that none of the cytokines tested are completely absent A striking example is the complete absence of TCR thymocyte development in IL 7 mutants in contrast to normal TCR cell development in Hoxa3 Pax1 mutants 29 which have dramatically reduced IL 7 levels This result suggests that although TCR cell development requires IL 7 low levels are sufficient for this function Therefore analysis of mutants with low levels of cytokines may provide a system for uncovering both dosage dependent requirements and later functions for these factors in promoting thymocyte development It is also possible that some of the differences seen between Hoxa3 Pax1 and cytokine mutant phenotypes reflect different effects of cytokines at fetal and adult stages Studies of IL 7R mutants showed relatively normal thymocyte maturation at fetal stages albeit with reduced thymocyte numbers in contrast to a severe block in thymocyte differentiation in adult thymus 49 Analysis of cytokine mutants during fetal stages could therefore reveal a more complete picture of the role of these cytokines during fetal thymus development Conclusions Our results show that fetal and adult wild type thymocytes have stage specific differences in proliferation with both TN1 and DP cells exhibiting higher levels of proliferation in fetal thymus This fetal wild type profile was very similar to that seen for fetal Rag mutant thymocytes in contrast to adult Rag thymus Therefore the changes in proliferation seen in the fetal Rag mutant thymocytes reflect the earliest microenvironment changes occurring as a result of defective TEC thymocyte interactions in the Rag thymus The current study further supports a role for TECs in regulating both thymocyte proliferation and survival during the DN DP transition and suggests that proliferation and apoptosis of TN4 and DP cells are regulated independently Our results provide direct genetic evidence for these functions of TECs by showing that these processes are defective in mutants with a primary TEC differentiation defect the Hoxa3 Pax1 compound mutants Taken together our results further define the role TECs play at this complex stage of thymocyte development Methods Mice and genotyping Hoxa3 Pax1 mice were mated to Pax1 or Pax1 mice and genotyped for both Hoxa3 and Pax1 by PCR as described
