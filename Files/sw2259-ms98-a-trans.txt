 well how how do you feel about the immigration laws at currently i think they are a little restrictive uh particularly for uh certain ethnic groups or from certain countries um i think we should permit uh more immigration from eastern Europe for example uh particularly the uh the Jewish uh uh people from Russia i think we could permit more of them in than we have uh permitted in the last uh several years and i think we have uh uh too much restriction on the uh on the Orientals also but of course that s just my opinion yeah well i m not real sure why i got this topic because i don t think i checked it off on the list because i know very little about the current immigration laws um hum um hum well we seem to uh to favor certain uh uh countries particularly South American countries and uh there is no uh uh i have nothing of course against uh the uh the South Americans or uh or Hispanics in that sense but i think we uh are more restrictive of the um so called eastern uh European countries than we uh uh we should be of course that s from my own bias since my ancestors from Eastern Europe so oh and uh so i think uh you know the um embargo we placed on the uh on the Russian Jews although we spent of uh spent years and years uh lobbying for their release and their ability to um immigrate from Russia as soon as that occurred we uh huh simply said that uh instead of the uh hundred and fifty thousand or so who wanted to immigrate to this country we cut that by uh two thirds so hum i do not quite go along with that but no that doesn t make a whole of lot sense no and i still think you know again kind of having uh uh within this century come from a uh uh an immigrant family or immigrant families on both sides both my mother s parents and my father s parents were immigrants so um hum i m a little touchy every now and then about that yeah well uh my uh my family is from uh Europe from well from England and Ireland um hum and uh have been in this country for oh more than a hundred and fifty years almost two hundred years oh my so i don t have any any uh relatives that i am or or uh several generations back that i am familiar with their names and how they fit into the family they were all they were all born here uh huh so i don t have any real strong ties with any with with the immigration laws i don t because i don t i don t have any personal feelings about them and i i haven t taken the time or effort to learn what they are well i think in a way though uh uh i also have uh an opposite point of view which is uh although i believe we should uh permit uh you know constant immigration into this country um uh huh i think we should uh primarily for economic reasons i think we should have um some quotas of course my family and i again again that was you know my uh grandparents came over during the time when uh there were quotas so they had to wait uh you know in uh certain parts of Europe for years before they were permitted to come over uh huh so you know but uh yeah i i i think unrestricted immigration i think is not uh is not best uh well i agree with that i i think if immigration was entirely unrestricted uh not only would would the United States become over populated well more over populated awfully quickly i think it it would bring in a lot of uh people that are run out of other countries or in trouble in in other countries i think they d come here trying to find a new market for their their brand of crime um hum well you know there s another aspect of this too they re also uh uh diminishing the uh health restrictions which i was not aware aware of that well yes there are were some uh regulations over i don t know whether they re laws passed or or whatever they re called uh just recently where uh people with certain diseases cannot be excluded uh from immigration AIDS is one for example and uh recently uh tuberculosis which at one time if you had tuberculosis you could not get into this country uh they dropped that also uh huh so i think in in some some aspect some ways we are uh becoming a little too egalitarian in that in that sense but uh i think we should be a little more circumspect about it again my opinion yeah think we ve talked long enough i think so all right well i ve enjoyed talking to you or i i i have talked long enough okay thanks thank you bye bye good bye
