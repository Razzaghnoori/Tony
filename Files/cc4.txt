 Introduction In patients with ARDS and acute pulmonary hypertension inhaled NO has been shown to selectively dilate pulmonary vessels perfusing ventilated lung areas and to improve arterial oxygenation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 The plateau effect of NO on pulmonary vascular resistance and gas exchange is obtained at various concentrations ranging from 1 40 ppm 2 4 6 7 9 10 11 In the majority of patients a major improvement in arterial oxygenation can be obtained with NO concentrations 5 ppm 4 9 10 11 In addition the degree of response as well as the optimal NO dose varies both between individuals and from day to day 11 In sheep with experimental acute lung injury receiving inhaled NO a dose dependent increase in arterial oxygenations is found with a plateau effect at NO concentrations of 30 60 ppm 12 13 Nitric oxide concentrations 30 ppm may result in elevated concentrations of nitrogen dioxide NO 2 and methemoglobin particularly when 100 oxygen is administered together with NO 9 Because of the potential lung toxicity of NO 2 knowledge of the factors influencing the optimal dose of inhaled NO in humans is of critical importance for intensivists Recently it has been suggested that the presence of septic shock may decrease responsiveness to inhaled NO 14 among 25 patients with ARDS and septic shock only 40 responded to inhaled NO with an improvement in PaO 2 FiO 2 20 This proportion was estimated as abnormally low although there are no published data reporting the proportion of non septic patients with ARDS responding to inhaled NO by an increase in PaO 2 FiO 2 20 In the present study we hypothesized that the presence of septic shock and the administration of vasoconstrictors to patients with ARDS could modify the dose response to inhaled NO We wanted to assess whether in NO responding patients with septic shock higher NO concentrations were required to obtain a pulmonary effect similar to the one obtained in non septic patients In addition the effect of intravenous norepinephrine on an NO induced decrease in pulmonary artery pressure and increase in arterial oxygenation was investigated Therefore dose response studies were performed on two groups of critically ill patients with and without septic shock whose lungs were mechanically ventilated for ARDS All patients enrolled were NO responders and patients with septic shock were exclusively receiving intravenous norepinephrine for hemodynamic support Methods Patients During an 8 month period 29 consecutive hypoxemic patients with ARDS diagnosed on or after admission to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit SICU of La Piti Hospital in Paris Department of Anesthesiology were prospectively screened at an early stage of their respiratory disease Written informed consent was obtained from the patient s next of kin The study was approved by the Comit Consultatif de Protection des Personnes dans la Recherche Biom dicale of La Piti Salp tri re Hospital Inclusion criteria were 1 bilateral infiltrates on a bedside chest radiograph 2 PaO 2 200 mmHg using an FiO 2 of 1 0 and zero end expiratory pressure ZEEP 3 bilateral and extensive hyperdensities on a high resolution spiral thoracic CT scan 4 positive response to inhaled NO defined as a decrease in MPAP of at least 2 mmHg and an increase in PaO 2 FiO 2 1 0 PEEP 10 cmH 2 O of at least 40 mmHg after NO inhalation at an inspiratory concentration of 15 ppm These response criteria were fixed in order to select patients responding to NO by a decrease in MPAP and an increase in PaO 2 of sufficient magnitude to allow the determination of dose response curves It was considered that when the variation of the parameter studied either PaO 2 or pulmonary artery pressure was close or inferior to the precision of measurement it was not possible to accurately assess the dose response Exclusion criteria were 1 left ventricular failure defined as a cardiac index 21 min m 2associated with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 18 mmHg and or a left ventricular ejection fraction 50 as estimated by bedside transesophageal echocardiography 2 circulatory shock requiring an exogenous catecholamine other than norepinephrine or characterized by spontaneous fluctuations of blood pressure despite a constant infusion of norepinephrine 3 cardiac dysrhythmias 4 presence of a patent foramen ovale with a right to left atrial shunt as assessed by pulsed wave Doppler transesophageal echocardiography These exclusion criteria were intended to eliminate patients with cardiac failure intracardiac shunt or cardiovascular instability in whom an accurate evaluation of dose response to inhaled NO would have been either difficult or heavily biased 15 Among the 29 patients initially screened for inclusion 13 had to be excluded no response to NO n 6 left ventricular failure n 4 circulatory shock with an unstable arterial pressure n 2 atrial fibrillation n 1 Finally 16 patients fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria were included Eight patients were in septic shock and eight patients had no septic shock Diagnosis of septic shock was made according to the criteria of the American College of Chest Physicians Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference 16 requiring 1 a systemic response to infection and 2 a systolic blood pressure 90 mmHg despite adequate fluid resuscitation requiring vasopressor agents Adult respiratory distress syndrome was diagnosed according to the recent American European Consensus Conference 17 and its severity was graded according to Murray et al 18 In each patient the trachea was orally intubated with a HiLo Jet TMno 8 Mallinckrodt tube Inc Argyle NY which incorporates two side ports one ending at the distal tip of the endotracheal tube and a more proximal port ending 6 cm from the tip These additional channels were used for continuous monitoring of tracheal pressure and tracheal concentrations of inhaled NO After inclusion in the study all patients were sedated and paralysed with a continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl 250 g h flunitrazepam 1 mg h and vecuronium 4 mg h and their lungs were ventilated using conventional mechanical ventilation C sar Ventilator Taema France For each patient tidal volume and respiratory rate were adjusted to maintain constant minute ventilation throughout the study An inspiratory time of 30 a PEEP of 10 cmH 2 O and an FiO 2 of 0 85 were maintained throughout the study period FiO 2 was continuously monitored using an O 2 analyser S r s 4000 Aix en Provence France in order to detect changes resulting from the admixture of inspired gases with NO All patients were monitored using a fiberoptic thermodilution pulmonary artery catheter Oximetrix Opticath Catheter Abbot Critical Care System and a radial or femoral arterial catheter In order to accurately assess the extension of pulmonar hyperdensities and thereby the severity of ARDS patients were transported to the Department of Radiology Thoracic Division for a lung scan The scan was performed from the apex to the diaphragm using a Tomoscan SR 7000 Philips Eindhoven and a semi quantitative assessment of parenchymal consolidation in ZEEP was performed according to a technique previously described 4 5 8 9 CT scans were obtained in all patients except patient 8 who could not be transported to the Department of Radiology because of an unstable pelvic fracture Measurements Systolic and diastolic arterial pressures SAP and DAP and systolic and diastolic pulmonary arterial pressures SPAP and DPAP were simultaneously measured using the arterial cannula and the fiberoptic pulmonary artery catheter connected to two calibrated pressure transducers 91 DPT 308 Mallinckrodt positioned at the midaxillary line Systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures electrocardiogram EKG tracheal pressure Paw measured through the distal port of the endotracheal tube and gas flow and tidal volume V T measured using a heated and calibrated Hans Rudolph pneumotachograph were simultaneously and continuously recorded on a Gould ES 1000 recorder Gould Instruments Cleveland OH throughout the entire study period at a paper speed of 1 mm s In all patients expired CO 2 was measured using a nonaspirative calibrated 47210 A infrared capnometer Hewlett Packard positioned between the proximal end of the endotracheal tube and the Y piece of the ventilator Expired CO 2 curves were continuously recorded on the Gould ES 1000 recorder at a paper speed of 1 mm s After withdrawing an arterial blood sample the ratio of alveolar dead space VD A to V T was calculated as VD A V T 1 P ET CO 2 PaCO 2 where P ET CO 2 is end tidal CO 2 measured at the plateau of the expired CO 2 curve Expired CO 2 curves were then recorded at a paper speed of 50 mm s and only tracings demonstrating a clear end expiratory plateau defined as a constant CO 2 value for more than 0 5 s at end expiration were used to determine P ET CO 2 In patient 11 VD A V T was not calculated because no plateau could be identified on the expired CO 2 curve Because ARDS is associated with abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature local thrombi and pulmonary vasoconstriction at the early stage and vascular remodeling at the late stage VD A V T can be considered as a better index of these vascular lesions than physiologic dead space calculated by the Bohr equation which takes into account the anatomic dead space 19 In each phase see experimental protocol when a steady state was obtained defined as a leveling of the pulmonary arterial pressure SAP DAP SPAP DPAP pulmonary capillary wedge pressure PWP right atrial pressure RAP V T Paw and gas flow were recorded at a paper speed of 50 mm s Mean arterial pressure MAP was calculated as 1 3 SAP 2 3 DAP Mean pulmonary artery pressure was measured by planimetry as the mean of four measurements performed at end expiration Systolic arterial pressure DAP SPAP DPAP PWP and RAP were also measured at end expiration Cardiac output was measured using the thermodilution technique and a bedside computer allowing the recording of each thermodilution curve Oximetrix 3 SO 2 CO Computer Four serial 10 ml injections of 5 dextrose solution at room temperature were performed at random during the respiratory cycle 20 Systemic and pulmonary arterial blood samples were simultaneously withdrawn within 1 min following cardiac output measurements after discarding an initial 10 ml heparin contaminated aliquot Arterial pH PaO 2 mixed venous partial pressure of oxygen PvO 2 and PaCO 2 were measured using an IL BGE TMblood gas analyser Hemoglobin concentration methemoglobin concentration and arterial and mixed venous oxygen saturations SaO 2 and SvO 2 were measured using a calibrated OSM3 hemoximeter Arterial and mixed venous blood samples that showed hemoglobin concentrations differing by more than 0 1 g 100 ml were considered diluted and the highest hemoglobin concentration was used to calculate oxygen content Standard formulae were used to calculate cardiac index CI PVRI systemic vascular resistance index SVRI right ventricular stroke work index RVSWI venous admixture Q VA Q T arteriovenous oxygen difference C av O 2 oxygen delivery DO 2 oxygen extraction ratio EaO 2 and oxygen consumption VO 2 In all patients respiratory pressure volume P V curves were measured using a 1 l syringe Model Series 5540 Hans Rudolph Inc Kansas City MO according to a previously described technique 8 Construction of inspiratory and expiratory P V curves allowed determination of opening pressure Pop static respiratory compliance Crs calculated as the slope of the curve between 500 1000 ml and quasi static respiratory compliance Cqs obtained by dividing the V T by the corresponding airway pressure Opening pressure could be clearly identified in nine patients and was always 10 cmH 2 O A PEEP of 10 cmH 2 O was systematically applied to all patients Nitric oxide administration Nitric oxide was released from three different tanks of nitrogen that had NO concentrations of 25 900 and 2000 ppm measured using chemiluminescence Air Liquide France Nitric oxide was delivered into the inspiratory limb of the ventilator just after the Fisher Paykel humidifier according to a previously described technique 9 With the aid of a calibrated and heated pneumotachograph Model Series 3500B Hans Rudolph Inc Kansas City MO attached to the proximal end of the endotracheal tube V T was reduced to exactly compensate for the added volume of nitrogen and NO coming from the tank Thus V T and minute ventilation delivered to the patients were kept constant for all concentrations of inhaled NO Inspiratory expiratory and mean concentrations of NO and NO 2 were continuously measured using a fast response time chemiluminescence apparatus NOX 4000 S r s Aix en Provence France Intratracheal gas was sampled by continuous aspiration through the proximal side port of the Mallinckrodt endotracheal tube ie 162 cm from the site of NO administration The NOX 4000 is a chemiluminescence apparatus specifically designed for medical use When using an aspiration flow rate of 150 ml min the response time defined as the time necessary to reach 95 of a reference NO concentration is around 30 s and only mean concentrations of NO can be accurately measured When an aspiration flow rate of 1000 ml min is selected the response time is 0 765 ms and inspiratory and expiratory NO concentrations can be accurately measured In a previous study we demonstrated that inspiratory and expiratory concentrations of NO were adequately measured by the NOX 4000 with a precision of 5 9 During the study inspiratory and expiratory NO concentrations were continuously measured and recorded after setting the aspiration flow rate of the NOX 4000 at 1000 ml min In addition in steady state conditions mean intratracheal NO concentrations were measured by setting the aspiration flow rate of the NOX 4000 at 150 ml min When the aspiration flow rate was changed the tidal volume setting of the ventilator was modified accordingly in order to achieve a constant minute ventilation and stable NO concentration In order to increase precision two different operating ranges of measurement were used depending on the concentrations of NO administered to the patient an operating range of 0 5 ppm was selected for inspiratory tracheal concentrations of 0 15 0 45 1 5 and 4 5 ppm and an operating range of 0 200 ppm for inspiratory tracheal concentrations of 15 45 and 150 ppm When 0 5 ppm was selected calibration was performed using a tank of NO with a reference concentration of 0 945 ppm CFPO Air Liquide France when 0 200 ppm was selected calibration was performed using a tank of NO with a reference concentration of 22 8 ppm CFPO Air Liquide France Nitrogen oxides NOX were calibrated using the same reference tanks according to the manufacturer s instructions The oxygen analyser of the NOX 4000 was used for continuous monitoring of oxygen concentration in order to ensure that a constant FiO 2 was maintained during NO inhalation whatever the concentration administered Protocol Phase 1 PEEP without NO control 1 Baseline measurements were made following a 1 h steady state of conventional mechanical ventilation using the following ventilatory settings FiO 2 0 85 PEEP 10 cmH 2 O inspiratory time 30 respiratory frequency 16 2 bpm V T 728 32 ml Phase 2 PEEP 10 cm H 2O with NO at increasing inspiratory concentrations dose response curve Using the same ventilatory settings as in phase 1 seven inspiratory tracheal concentrations of NO chosen according to a logarithmic scale were randomly administered 0 15 0 45 1 5 4 5 15 45 and 150 ppm Because concentrations of 45 and 150 ppm were associated with a longlasting increase in blood methemoglobin concentration which interfered with the calculation of venous and arterial O 2 content and pulmonary shunt they were not included in the randomization but were always administered as the last concentrations For each inspiratory tracheal concentration of NO expiratory and mean intratracheal concentrations of NO were measured and recorded In addition V T and FiO 2 were adjusted at the ventilator level in order to maintain a constant minute ventilation and an FiO 2 of 0 85 as assessed by the pneumotachograph and the oxygen analyser For each inspiratory NO concentration hemodynamic and respiratory measurements were recorded after a 15 min steady state Phase 3 PEEP 10 cm H 2O without NO control 2 At the end of a 1 h steady state following the discontinuation of NO 150 ppm hemodynamic and respiratory paramaters were measured at the same ventilator settings as in phase 1 Statistical analysis Cardiorespiratory parameters at control were compared between groups using a Student s t test for unpaired data The cardiorespiratory effects of NO were analysed in each group using contrast analysis control values were compared with values obtained using graded concentrations of NO In both groups of patients the existence of a dose related effect was investigated using a one way analysis of variance for repeated measures including only the different concentrations of NO Dose response curves of NO on hemodynamic and respiratory parameters in the presence or absence of septic shock were analysed using a two way analysis of variance for one within and one grouping factor ie factor group absence or presence of septic shock and factor dose of NO Interaction between these two factors allowed us to test the hypothesis that the effect of NO differed depending on the presence or absence of septic shock The significance level was fixed at 5 but due to the nature of the analysis of variance we used the criterion of Huynh and Feld rather than the classical F value 21 Calculations were made using Super ANOVA statistical software Abanus Concepts Inc All values are expressed as mean SEM Results Patients Among the 16 men enrolled in the study eight were admitted to the SICU following multiple trauma and eight following postoperative complications after major surgical procedures vascular surgery n 1 cardiac surgery n 3 orthopedic surgery n 1 digestive surgery n 2 neurosurgery n 1 Eight patients were in septic shock defined as the presence of an identified infectious foci associated with arterial hypotension requiring the continuous intravenous administration of norepinephrine 16 Norepinephrine was administered in doses ranging between 1 and 5 mg h All patients were studied at the early phase of ARDS first 5 days As shown in Tables 1and 2 all patients had ARDS characterized by arterial hypoxemia increased Q VA Q T pulmonary artery hypertension reduced respiratory compliance and consolidation of lung parenchyma involving at least 45 of total lung volume Initial clinical hemodynamic and respiratory parameters were not statistically different between patients with and without septic shock NO concentrations Table 3shows that inspiratory intratracheal NO concentrations were 1 5 2 times greater than mean intratracheal NO concentrations Expiratory concentrations of NO progressively increased with mean NO concentrations For an inspiratory NO concentration of 0 15 ppm expired NO was not detectable For an inspiratory NO concentration of 0 45 ppm expired NO could be measured in 15 patients From inspiratory NO concentrations of 1 5 ppm expired NO could be measured in all patients Hemodynamic and respiratory effects of NO in patients without septic shock As shown in Tables 4and 5 NO induced a significant dose dependent decrease in MPAP SPAP DPAP PVRI RVSWI and Q VA Q T with a significant and dose dependent increase in PaO 2 FiO 2 As shown in Figs 1 2 3 a plateau effect was observed at inspiratory NO concentrations of 4 5 ppm for MPAP PVRI Q VA Q T and PaO 2 FiO 2 All other hemodynamic and respiratory parameters did not vary significantly Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters returned to control values after the cessation of inhaled NO Hemodynamic and respiratory effects of NO in patients with septic shock Hemodynamic and respiratory effects of increasing inspiratory concentrations of NO in patients with septic shock are summarized in Tables 6and 7 A significant dose dependent decrease in SPAP DPAP MPAP PVRI RVSWI PaCO 2 VD A V T and Q VA Q T and a significant dose dependent increase in PaO 2 FiO 2 were observed The maximum decrease in mean PVRI PaCO 2 and VD A V T was obtained for an inspiratory NO concentration of 4 5 ppm Fig 3 The maximum increase in PaO 2 FiO 2 was obtained for an inspiratory NO concentration of 150 ppm Figs 1and 2 All other hemodynamic and respiratory parameters did not vary significantly Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters returned to control values after the cessation of NO inhalation Effects of septic shock on dose response curves At control hemodynamic and respiratory parameters were the same for both groups Dose response curves of inhaled NO for MPAP PVRI RVSWI PaCO 2 and Q VA Q T were not significantly different between patients with and without septic shock Figs 1 2 3 As shown in Fig 2 the effect of inhaled NO on PaO 2 FiO 2 was significantly increased by the presence of septic shock In patients with septic shock inhaled NO increased PaO 2 FiO 2 by 190 the maximum effect being obtained at an inspiratory NO concentration of 150 ppm In patients without septic shock inhaled NO increased PaO 2 FiO 2 by 81 the maximum effect being obtained at an inspiratory NO concentration of 4 5 ppm Using a two way analysis of variance a significant interaction was found for the factor group P 0 047 Individual variability of dose response curves As shown in Figs 4and 5 dose response curves demonstrated marked variability between individuals In patients without septic shock the decrease in MPAP varied from 11 to 45 whereas the increase in PaO 2 FiO 2 varied from 30 to 220 Fig 4 In five patients a clear plateau could be identified for the decrease in MPAP Fig 4c whereas MPAP continued to decrease with higher NO concentrations in three Fig 4a Different patterns were observed for PaO 2 FiO 2 in four patients the PaO 2 FiO 2 ratio deteriorated at the highest inspiratory NO concentrations Fig 4d whereas in the other four PaO 2 FiO 2 continued to increase Fig 4b The patients whose PaO 2 FiO 2 ratio continued to increase with the highest NO concentrations demonstrated a clear plateau effect in MPAP at NO concentrations of 4 5 ppm suggesting that the effects of NO on gas exchange and pulmonary circulation can be dissociated In patients with septic shock Fig 5 the decrease in MPAP varied from 8 to 32 whereas the increase in PaO 2 varied from 60 to 380 In five patients a clear plateau could be identified on the dose response curve of MPAP Fig cc whereas it continued to decrease with higher NO concentrations in three Fig 4a In two patients PaO 2 FiO 2 deteriorated at the highest inspiratory NO concentrations Fig 5d whereas in the other six PaO 2 FiO 2 continued to increase Fig 5b As observed in patients without septic shock the effects of NO on arterial oxygenation and pulmonary artery pressure were dissociated In two patients only patients 10 and 11 dose response curves were characterized by a concurrent dose dependent decrease in MPAP and an increase in PaO 2 FiO 2 in the range of 0 15 to 150 ppm inhaled NO Toxic effects of increasing concentrations of inhaled NO As shown in Table 3 methemoglobin and NO 2 significantly increased at inspiratory NO concentrations of 15 ppm A mean intratracheal NO 2 concentration of 4 0 9 ppm and a mean methemoglobin concentration of 3 8 0 5 were observed at an inspiratory NO concentration of 150 ppm Discussion Factors influencing individual dose response curves During mechanical ventilation intratracheal NO concentrations fluctuate according to the phase of respiration 9 the inspiratory concentration being greater than the expiratory concentration because NO is absorbed at the alveolar level In the present study NO concentrations delivered to the patient were determined by sampling the endotracheal gas using a fast response chemiluminescence apparatus in order to accurately measure inspiratory NO concentration 9 If used slow response chemiluminescence would have underestimated the true inspiratory NO concentration by averaging it together with the expiratory level as probably occurred in two of our previous studies 4 23 Another reason for determining the inspiratory NO concentration in this way was the method of NO administration used Continuous administration of NO through the initial part of the inspiratory limb during volume controlled ventilation invariably results in fluctuation of the NO concentration within the inspiratory limb due to a bolus effect 24 25 Although mixing of NO increases with distance from the site of administration 24 a fast response analyser is required to accurately measure the peak NO concentration during the inspiratory phase We previously demonstrated in an in vitro experiment that the NOX 4000 was able to measure rapid fluctuations of NO concentrations with a precision 95 9 In the present study two different patterns of dose response curves were observed In 10 patients five in each group a plateau effect for MPAP could be identified at NO concentrations ranging between 0 45 and 4 5 ppm In six patients three in each group MPAP continued to decrease with the highest NO concentrations Figs 4and 5 These different variation profiles did not appear to be related to the presence of septic shock Although the mean pulmonary vascular effect of inhaled NO was not affected by the presence of septic shock the resulting improvement in arterial oxygenation was of a greater magnitude in patients with septic shock Fig 2 The reasons for this difference are not clear It can be hypothesized that the same degree of inhaled NO induced vasodilation of the pulmonary vessels perfusing ventilated lung areas resulted in a greater redistribution of pulmonary blood flow in patients with septic shock This implies that for the same extent of lung consolidation basal pulmonary blood flow perfusing non ventilated lung areas was greater in patients with septic shock As a matter of fact although the percentage of lung consolidation tended to be greater in patients without septic shock 63 vs 57 their mean PaO 2 tended to be higher 95 16 vs 88 11 mmHg suggesting some degree of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction impairment in the non ventilated lung areas of patients with septic shock It is well known that acute lung infection and septic shock may impair hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction through the massive release from activated endothelium of vasodilating mediators such as prostaglandins and endogenous NO and hence result in disproportionately high shunting and hypoxemia 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 In addition exogenous catecholamines used to maintain arterial pressure during septic shock interfere with hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction vasodilators like isoproterenol or dobutamine tend to inhibit hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction whereas vasoconstrictors like dopamine epinephrine or norepinephrine tend to reinforce hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction In the present study patients with circulatory shock receiving vasodilating inotrops were excluded in order to eliminate the interferences between these agents inhaled NO and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction Confirming a previous study 11 an important interpatient variability was found in both groups of patients Figs 4and 5 Several factors may account for this variability at the time of investigation endogenous vasoconstricting mediators involved in pulmonary artery hypertension were probably different between patients In animal studies NO dose response curves depend on the model of acute lung injury and on the pathophysiology of pulmonary artery hypertension 33 34 35 In patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation dose response curves of inhaled NO on MPAP have been found to be in the range of 1 100 ppm 2 It has been suggested that pulmonary vasoconstrictors are continuously activated by the extracorporeal circuit and released into the circulation thus contributing to pulmonary hypertension 36 37 38 39 Therefore it is conceivable that higher concentrations of NO are necessary to obtain the maximum effect of NO on pulmonary artery pressure In the present study dose response curves in the range of 0 15 to 150 ppm were observed in three patients without septic shock and in three patients with septic shock By analogy with the dose response curves obtained in patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation it can be hypothesized that the presence of large amounts of circulating pulmonary vasoconstrictors in these patients led to the need for greater NO concentrations The variability of circulating vasoactive mediators from one day to another has been recently advocated to explain the variability of the dose response to NO on different days in the same patient 11 There are three factors that could have a potential influence on the responsiveness of patients with ARDS to inhaled NO 1 the anatomical remodeling of the pulmonary circulation 2 the reduction of the lung volume accessible to gas and 3 the presence of septic shock External compression of the pulmonary vessels by PEEP thickening of pulmonary arterial walls observed in the late stage of ARDS and thrombosis 40 contribute to further increase pulmonary artery pressure which becomes less and less sensitive to inhaled NO If the alveolar space available for distribution of NO is reduced only a small number of pulmonary vessels can be reached thus limiting the efficiency of NO Because all patients were enrolled in the study during the first 5 days of acute respiratory failure it is unlikely that wall thickening was an important limiting factor of NO efficiency However a major reduction in lung volume was likely to account for the limited effect of NO observed in some patients with lung consolidation 70 patients 3 7 and 10 in Figs 4and 5 Recently it has been suggested that the presence of septic shock may impair responsiveness to inhaled NO 14 However due to the small number of patients included in this study and the absence of a control group further studies are required to confirm this interesting hypothesis Finally the maximum pulmonary vascular effect and the dose response of inhaled NO on pulmonary artery pressure depends on many diverse factors that may be associated in a given patient type and concentration of circulating pulmonary vasoconstrictors and vasodilators endogenous and exogenous relative importance of fixed and nonfixed components of pulmonary artery hypertension and loss of lung volume The results of the present study show that during the early stage of ARDS inspiratory NO concentrations around 5 ppm provide the maximum decrease in pulmonary artery pressure in the majority of patients whereas higher concentrations are necessary in a minority of patients Dissociation between pulmonary vascular effects and effects on gas exchange Quantitatively the effects of NO on pulmonary artery pressure and arterial oxygenation were well correlated in 75 of patients In 11 subjects patients 5 to 8 and 10 to 16 quantitative variations in PaO 2 and pulmonary artery pressure were in agreement a decrease in MPAP 20 of the control value was associated with an increase in PaO 2 FiO 2 130 of the control value and vice versa In five subjects patients 1 to 4 and patient 9 inhaled NO induced changes in MPAP and PaO 2 FiO 2 were quantitatively dissociated Patient 9 illustrates this Fig 5 although among patients with septic shock he had the greatest NO induced decrease in MPAP his PaO 2 FiO 2 ratio only increased by 70 These results clearly suggest that although linked NO induced pulmonary vascular effects and effects on arterial oxygenation can be dissociated in patients with ARDS In patients with septic shock pulmonary arterial pressure plateaued at 15 ppm whereas PaO 2 FiO 2 continued to increase at higher NO concentrations This is in apparent contrast with two previous dose response studies showing that the increase in PaO 2 in patients with ARDS generally occurs at an inspiratory NO concentration range lower than the one necessary to decrease pulmonary artery pressure 2 11 Further undetectable changes in pulmonary artery pressure may induce pulmonary blood flow redistribution and changes in arterial oxygenation 2 3 11 Recently however Lowson et al 10 found as did this study that PaO 2 continued to increase whereas pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance plateaued at NO concentrations 0 1 ppm In fact among six dose response studies already published 2 4 9 10 11 22 only two 2 11 have suggested that NO concentrations required to improve PaO 2 are less than those required to decrease pulmonary artery pressure At high concentrations it may be that NO reaches pulmonary vessels perfusing non ventilated lung areas and worsens arterial oxygenation by inhibiting hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction as observed in patients 1 2 6 8 and 15 This spillover of NO into the pulmonary circulation could occur either by diffusion through the lung structures or directly by transportation in the blood stream 41 In conclusion in patients with ARDS the presence of septic shock treated by norepinephrine administration does not modify the inhaled NO induced pulmonary artery vascular effect but amplifies the resulting improvement in arterial oxygenation Although dose response curves are characterized by a wide inter patient variability 90 of the pulmonary vascular effect is obtained for NO concentrations 4 5 ppm in patients with or without septic shock The use of such low concentrations precludes any potential toxicity due to the generation of high concentrations of NO 2 and methemoglobin In many patients the pulmonary vascular effect and effect on gas exchange although linked are dissociated suggesting that redistribution of pulmonary blood flow does not exclusively depend on the intensity of the pulmonary vasodilating effect In a minority of patients inspiratory NO concentrations 5 ppm may be necessary to obtain the maximum improvement in arterial oxygenation
