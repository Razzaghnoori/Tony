        so how do you keep up on current events      well i  take the  a daily paper i take the Houston Chronicle and uh when i my ritual in the morning is get my cup of coffee and the paper and sit down and  check the headlines and at the same time ive got uh CNN on TV  so uh thats sort of how i start the day is uh finding out whats going on and then uh in my business im in the oil business and we keep a a television tuned to CNN all day long and uh at a very at a real low volume uh that started back whenever we had the the war and uh the oil market was very volatile   umhum   and its something that we just  you know weve weve stayed with and weve all kind of got accustomed to it and whenever theres anything exciting happening well were weve got the access to it right away   thats right your usually probably probably more adept at more adept adept at the news uh than most people i would assume i uh i dont quite have as the as regimented of a ritual as you do i get up in the morning if i dont have to go to work and ill grab the paper ill usually pull out the sports section and the business section and try to read those two first and then after i get through those ill turn to the front front page news and and uh if an article catches my my my eye ill ill read it otherwise ill just flip through the paper and you know like i said if if nothing really sounds interesting ill just skip over it   yeah yeah well i im ill have to admit now  Monday through Friday my newspaper reading is pretty much uh hit the high points and let it go but on Sundays i really i really dig into it im im a pretty voracious uh Sunday paper reader thats a a big part of my uh  Sundays relax with the Sunday paper and coffee and breakfast and just go completely through it but um   do you do you guys have a pretty uh pretty thick paper there in in Houston on Sundays   yeah the uh the Chronicle is its you know its similar to uh i guess the Dallas Morning News   okay thats thats a good thats a good sized paper   yeah yeah   theres theres a couple hours project right there   yeah but it its always kind of i mean and it is something i take a lot of pleasure in i i thoroughly enjoy it but its always amazed me uh  i dont know ive got a my brother in in Austin for instance  that i mean he never looks at the paper hes not interested you know and its just its kind of astounding to me im i subscribed to Time magazine   uhhuh   oh i guess for  five or six years nonstop you know and and it was a good source for a lot of information but   uhhuh   then i moved and  didnt renew my subscription and now i dont i kind of got out of the habit of that but um im im interested in whats going on in the world and like to stay as you know as as as current as i as one can um   right   i know uh oh i generally work pretty late and consequently im not able to uh catch the the evening news but if i on on on the occasions that i do get in early enough i like to watch the ABC evening news i like uh  uh   right   uh Peter Jennings yeah a lot better than any of the other uh announcers   was that Peter Jennings yeah okay i uh  admittedly dont really tune myself into the into either the five thirty the local news or the six oclock news i uh it usually ends up being a repeat of  what was in the morning paper or else if its early enough itll be in the next days paper and uh   umhum   the local news is is to me it isnt that interesting because its generally not too much human interest stuff its more the you know somebody died here or we had a fire here   right right   and uh  i dont know i i when i was growing up i used to watch it all the time and maybe that was because i i grew up in a small town where the local news meant something to me because i could relate to the area or to the town or to the people but you know in in when you have a a Dallas Fort Worth market i really dont care what happened in Fort Worth or Arlington for that matter   yeah yeah yeah well it interesting that it that you know you mention a small town i have a friend of mine who um shes a school teacher and  this year um moved into a to a pretty small town i mean were talking about maybe sixteen thousand people or so and is teaching school there she really does she loves her   umhum   her work and she likes living there she said the part of it that drives her crazy is is shes accustomed to living in a city and having a big newspaper and she said you know its the little things
