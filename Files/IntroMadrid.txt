 Madrid and its People the Madrile os For a half millennium or more Madrid idled as a provincial backwater rarely noticed on the arid central plains of Castile until Felipe II plucked it from his royal cap in 1561 and proclaimed it the capital of Spain Man made Madrid which quickly assumed the reigns of Spain s Golden Age hasn t stopped growing and asserting itself since Though one of Europe s youngest capitals it s had plenty of time to catch up to Spain s more historic cities including Seville Toledo and Granada and today it is their political administrative and economic superior Only Barcelona rivals it in economic importance Felipe II s royal decree was based entirely on geography the idea being that Madrid smack in the center of Iberia would promote centralized authority over regional power bases in a newly unified Spain Today Madrid is that cohesive center and more It is a city to which people migrate from all over Spain in search of new opportunities a place where few people can claim any deep roots Madrid is a bustling sprawling mostly modern metropolis This capital city of four million is constantly rattled by noise and stifled by dense traffic As Spain has solidified its place in the European Union Madrid has become larger more important and yes somewhat less characteristically Iberian Once its immigrants were from the surrounding regions of Spain today its newcomers are from across Europe and beyond bringing with them new languages and customs Among other parts of Spain Andaluc a is more folkloric Catalonia and the Basque country more proudly independent Barcelona and Granada possess greater architecture and many Spanish cities have finer natural attributes But Madrile os don t begrudge those places anything Madrid may be a planned bureaucrat s town like Brasilia or Washington but it s far richer in color and tone Madrid is the next rung down from heaven so the boastful local saying goes and the city s residents claim their superiority in other terms Madrid reigns in cultural life and vida nocturna night life Few cities have so perfected the art of socializing eating and drinking in public A collective and gregarious lot who seem to carry on much of their lives in the streets Madrile os are stars when night falls hopping in and out of tabernas and tascas cave like taverns and bars for repeated rituals of tapas bar finger foods jugs of Spanish wine and hyper animated conversation The night goes late very late in Madrid and there s not a day of the week that the streets aren t flooded by hordes of after hours diners and bar hoppers A lack of sleep can always be remedied later a Madrile o might tell you as he tops off a late night with early morning chocolate con curros a fried dough and chocolate snack ideal for absorbing alcohol on the way home for a shower and then continues on to work The night s rowdy revelers get most of the attention surely Madrid must pack in more bars discos and live music venues per capita than any other sizeable European city Yet the city also makes plenty of room for more elevated pursuits including Spain s most sophisticated cultural life opera theater zarzuela an indigenous form of light comic opera and dance These entertainments flourish as does flamenco a popular art form with spiritual callings for both the purist and the tourist Madrid s cultural output reaches its apogee though in its superb concentration of art museums On one grand boulevard the Paseo del Prado are three of Europe s finest museums the world class Prado museum the Thyssen Bornemisza collection and the Centro de Arte Reina Sof a Queen Sof a Art Center whose claim to fame is the 20th century s most famous painting Pablo Picasso s Guernica Madrid s collection of Spanish Old Masters Ve l zquez El Gre co Goya Zur bar n and more is un rivalled in the world Though a city of immigrants the city clings to castizo working class Ma dri le o traditions Madrid is the focus of that fiercest of Span ish customs the bullfight and local ferias and fiestas like San Isidro a celebration of the city s patron saint are prepared and attended with the same zeal that they are in small Spanish towns In fact in the relatively small area that most visitors are likely to cover Madrid doesn t really feel like an overgrown Europeanized capital With its friendly taverns street booksellers and mom and pop shops it frequently seems like a small albeit densely populated Spanish town and it is easily covered on foot The heart of the city is Viejo Madrid Old Madrid a largely 16th century city built upon the layout of narrow winding streets of an old Moorish settlement Madrid de los As tu rias is named for the Hapsburgs instrumental in the city s rapid growth during the 1600s Old Madrid s centerpiece is its splendid porticoed and sun glazed Plaza Mayor Little remains of medieval Madrid but there are glimpses of the oldest parts of the city in the Arab walls and several attractive small plazas as well as many other discoveries to be made in this area that extends from the River Manzanares and Palacio Real Royal Palace actually the legacy of the later Bourbon rulers to the lively congested Puerta del Sol still the nerve center of Madrid The Bourbon monarchs of the 18th century fostered Madrid s expansion east They built monumental Madrid a city of grand avenues and boulevards fountains gateways and parks Bourbon Madrid is best symbolized by the handsome Paseo del Prado and Parque del Buen Retiro once the royal family s private park and hunting grounds Modern Madrid grew unrelentingly in all directions beginning in the 19th century Its most attractive nucleus is the neighborhood of Salamanca an elite barrio of tony apartment buildings and sophisticated designer shops La Castellana and Paseo de Recoletos are continuations north of the Prado boulevard of the Bourbons Both are lined with sidewalk cafes and strollers on sunny days and summer nights Madrid spilled outward from there and especially in the last two decades has pushed farther and farther out leaving little distinction between city and suburb Madrid s diverse architecture while not the equal of a Paris or London traces the city s stages of expansion and prevailing styles of the different eras Moving outward from the center one passes from stately ornamental 16th century apartment buildings with shuttered windows wrought iron balconies and brick facades to the Baroque palaces of the Bourbons and later Neo classical buildings meant to convey authority The elegant and today traffic choked Gran V a Madrid s central shopping artery is a turn of the century showcase of Art Nouveau and Art Deco styles Madrid is at the forefront of a new dynamic Spain After tossing off the shackles of Franco s long dictatorship that isolated Spain from the rest of Europe Madrid erupted from the closet embracing a frenetic arts and nightlife scene called la movida in the early 1980s Homosexuality drugs all night partying and living life on the edge the credo of films by Pedro Almod var the boy wonder of la movida were the shocking symbols of the new Spain Once unshakingly traditional conservative and Catholic a country where official awards used to be given for fecundity Spain today has the fewest children in Europe Its population is actually dwindling as women assert themselves in careers and couples contemplate the economic challenges of raising a family in a congested and competitive city like Madrid Still the Spain of yesteryear flourishes in many corners of the city At the hour of the paseo stroll when offices empty Madrile os spill onto promenades and swamp outdoor caf s plunging into conversation Conservatively dressed businessmen escort impeccably coiffed women while retired gentlemen in cardigans jackets and ties play chess or petanca a game resembling marbles but played with heavy shot puts in the park Locals of all ages from senior citizens to high school kids donning Metallica T shirts crowd into 18th century taverns to sip sherry or vino tinto drawn from old wooden barrels and to munch on morsels of tortilla espa ola Madrid s easy embrace of extremes it is both the capital of a technology dependent country that exploded since becoming part of the European Union just 15 years ago and at heart a small town that revels in its castizo traditions is part of life here Even nature imposes extremes At an altitude of more than 640 meters 2 100 feet this city on the Castilian plateau Europe s highest capital is scorching in summer when wilting residents flee for the coast or cooler northern climes and freezing in winter when many Madrile os bolt for the Sierra Nevada just a couple hours south to ski Escaping after a few days in the capital is the plan of most visitors as well for most a trip to Madrid is as much about what the plains of Castile just beyond the city contain as what the capital itself offers Madrid is the perfect base for explorations into the heart and soul of Spain with a wealth of fascinating day trips and a trio of UNESCO honored cities just an hour or so from the city Toledo Spain s former capital set on a crag above a river moat is a living museum of El Greco and the legacy of a great capital city of Christians Jews and Muslims Segovia is a picture postcard of central Spain a royal stronghold with a fairy tale castle and astounding 2 000 year old Roman aqueduct The walled city of vila is the birthplace of the mystic St Theresa who still commands intense devotion among her followers Closer to Madrid are other sights that reveal pivotal periods of Spanish history El Escorial is a dramatic monastery mausoleum and palace built by Felipe II and one of the most visited places in Spain and nearby is El Valle de los Ca dos Valley of the Fallen Franco s memorial to his reign and soldiers killed in the Civil War of 1936 1939
