 Background Lead time bias Detection of an asymptomatic cancer by screening starts the clock at a younger age so the survival time from screen detection is longer than the survival time from clinical detection even if screening does not change the age of death As an analogy imagine waiting at a bus stop C for a bus traveling north to destination D Suppose you walk south and board the same bus at stop B prior to its arrival at C Although the bus ride from B to D is longer than from C to D by the lead time from B to C the arrival time at D is unchanged You have simply spent more of your life on the bus The travel time from B to D is a lead time biased estimate of the travel time from C to D Length bias Screening preferentially detects slower growing cancers because there is a longer period of time hence the name length bias when such cancers could be found on screening If slower growing cancers have a different prognosis than faster growing cancers the estimated survival time after diagnosis will be subject to length bias Continuing with the analogy suppose there are two types of buses slow local buses that frequently stop at B and fast express buses that rarely stop at B Because a bus boarded at B is most likely local the average time it takes to travel from C to D thus the lead time has been subtracted will be a length biased estimate of the averages of the local and express travel times from C to D Overdiagnosis bias Screening may detect cancers that would never surface clinically or be diagnosed in the absence of screening Continuing with the analogy suppose some buses stop at B but not D Overdiagnosis bias arises when counting all buses stopping at B as going to D Selection bias The type of subject who receives screening may differ from other subjects in ways that are related to survival times Continuing with the analogy suppose there is only one type of bus so there is no length bias or overdiagnosis bias but you only board it at stop B in the morning when the traffic is heaviest The time it takes the bus boarded at B to travel from C to D so lead time has been removed is a selection biased estimate of the average over the entire day of the travel times from C to D A randomized trial with an endpoint of death typically measured in each trial arm as a death rate among all participants avoids these biases Lead time bias is avoided by setting the time of randomization instead of the time of cancer detection as the zero time Length bias and overdiagnosis bias are avoided because the comparison is between randomized groups not between screen detected and clinically detected cancer cases The use of a mortality endpoint also avoids lead time bias length bias and overdiagnosis bias that would arise with an endpoint based on characteristics of the cancer For example suppose that stage were the endpoint of the trial A screen detected stage I cancer is likely to have a different prognosis than a clinically detected stage I cancer due to lead time length and overdiagnosis biases Therefore using stage as endpoint would bias the results Selection bias within the trial is avoided because randomization guarantees the same distribution of known and unknown covariates in both groups Under randomization imbalances can occur in the empirical distribution of baseline covariates These imbalances are not generally a concern unless they are extremely large even after adjusting for multiple comparisons In that case one should investigate if there were any deviation from random treatment assignment that may have affected cancer death rates It is important that only baseline characteristics be considered in investigating imbalance Characteristics that could be known only after randomization e g number of cancers diagnosed stage age at diagnosis cure rates of detected cancers are likely to be biased because the screening could have affected these characteristics and the analysis is no longer protected by randomization Randomization does not however correct for another type of selection bias Volunteers who participate in clinical trials and who consent to randomization may differ from the general population They often have better underlying health an effect known as healthy volunteer bias Although we do not discuss this bias further it should be considered in planning trial size and in trying to generalize trial results to the population at large Methods Our emphasis is on simple methods Although survival analyses from time of randomization e g logrank tests are sometimes used we focus on simple estimates based on the cumulative number of cancer deaths Because cancer death is a rare event in asymptomatic participants in a screening trial inference based on survival analysis and cumulative number of cancer deaths is similar 2 We assume the yearly numbers of cancer deaths follow a Poisson distribution which is appropriate for rare events Results 1 Use death from cancer as the primary endpoint but review death records carefully and report all causes of death The primary endpoint of most cancer screening trials is death from cancer Recently Black 3 identified two types of biases that can affect the assessment of the cancer death endpoint Sticky diagnosis bias arises when deaths from an uncertain cause are more likely to be attributed to cancer if there was a previous diagnosis of cancer especially if the diagnosis was relatively recent If there were overdiagnosis sticky diagnosis would induce a higher cancer death rate in the intervention group than actually the case Slippery linkage the second type of bias occurs because deaths that are caused or triggered by screening work up or a subsequent therapy e g perforation of the colon and perhaps cardiovascular deaths are not attributed to screening Using all deaths as an endpoint avoids these biases but leads to prohibitive sample sizes as shown in the following calculations based on a power of 80 and a one sided type I error of 2 5 First consider the design of a randomized trial with a cancer death endpoint Under the null hypothesis the probability of cancer death in each group is p Under the alternative hypothesis the probability of cancer death is p in the control group and p d in the study group where d is the probability of cancer death in the control group minus the probability of cancer death in the screened group For computing sample size we assume d is positive Assuming a Poisson distribution for the number of cancer deaths the sample size for both groups combined for a cancer death endpoint is N cancer 2 1 96 Sqrt 2 v cancerH0 84 Sqrt v cancerH0 v cancerHA 2 d 2 where v cancerH0 p and v cancerHA p d are the variances for one subject under the null and alternative hypotheses respectively Now consider the design of a randomized trial with an all death endpoint Let k denote the probability of death from causes unrelated to either cancer or screening Under the null hypothesis the probability of death from all causes is p k in each group Under the alternative hypothesis the probability of death from all causes is p k in the control group and p k d e in the screened group where e is the additional probability of non cancer deaths due to screening Therefore d e is the probability of death from all causes in the control group minus the probability of death from all causes in the screened group Assuming a binomial distribution for the number of deaths from all causes the sample size for both groups combined for an all death endpoint is N all 2 1 96 Sqrt 2 v allH0 84 Sqrt v allH0 v allHA 2 d e 2 where v allH0 p k 1 p k and v allHA p k d e 1 p k d e are the variances for one subject under the null and alternative hypotheses respectively For purposes of illustration suppose that p 005 k 15 these values are based roughly on data from a colorectal cancer screening trial 4 and d 001 To minimize N all we set e 0 With these specifications a study with a cancer death endpoint would require N cancer 150 000 participants while a study with an all death endpoint would require N all 4 1 million participants For practical considerations we recommend using cancer death as an endpoint with careful review of the death records to minimize sticky diagnosis and slippery linkage bias We also recommend that cancer deaths include any non cancer deaths attributable to screening or treatment for the cancer We also recommend that all deaths and their causes be reported If after adjusting for multiple comparisons there is a statistically significant difference between groups in the estimated probability of a particular non cancer cause of death the investigators should reexamine the death records to check for potential biases If there are no potential biases the investigators will need to consider the possibility that screening or treatment was responsible for the difference 2 Use a simple causal estimate to adjust for nonattendance and contamination occurring immediately after randomization Assumption 1 There are three types of subjects always takers who would receive screening if randomized to either group never takers who would not receive screening if randomized to either group and compliers who would receive screening if randomized to the intervention group but not the control group In other words no subjects would receive screening if randomized to the control group but not randomized to the intervention group Assumption 2 For always taker and never takers the probability of cancer death is the same for each treatment group In other words when a control subject switches to screening immediately after randomization the screening regime is identical to that in intervention group and when an intervention subject immediately refuses screening the lack of screening is identical to that in the control group Unfortunately neither of the assumptions is verifiable but they are reasonable and therefore have face validity Although the analysis is not by intent to treat it makes use of the randomization to avoid selection bias When computing f 0 and f 1 it is important to count only subjects who switch treatment immediately after randomization so as not to violate Assumption 2 With this modification d causal is unbiased even if additional subjects switch treatment later in the study as for example if some subjects are screened initially but refuse subsequent screenings The effect of later switching is folded into the interpretation Thus d causal is the estimated effect of immediately receiving screening with the understanding that the effect is likely attenuated from later switching of treatments In designing a randomized trial of cancer screening one should adjust the sample size for anticipated non attendance and contamination Suppose the anticipated fraction receiving immediate screening is f 0 and f 1 for the control and intervention groups respectively As derived by Zelen 11 the adjusted sample size is the sample size if there were full attendance and no contamination divided by f 1 f 0 2 3 Use a simple adaptive estimate to adjust for dilution following the last screen In a typical randomized trial of cancer screening screening is offered for a limited time and subjects are followed after screening has stopped This leads to a dilution of treatment effect as will be explained Consider a special baseline variable B such that B 1 if i the subject would not be detected with cancer if screened ii the subject would become a cancer case after the time of the last screen and iii the subject would die from the cancer during the follow up period Otherwise B 0 In other words B 1 indicates a set of cancer deaths that could not have benefited from screening We can identify subjects with B 1 in the screened group but not in the control group Let D denote the number of subjects with B 1 in the screened group By virtue of the randomization there will be approximately D subjects with B 1 in the control group As the length of follow up after the last screening increases the amount of dilution D increases which increases the variance of the estimated treatment difference In estimating the relative risk of randomization to screening or no screening the value of D affects the point estimate because D is added to both the numerator and denominator But when estimating a difference in treatment effect between the groups the value of D cancels Nevertheless the point estimate of a difference in treatment effect will likely change systematically during follow up The reason is that as follow up increases the point estimate includes longer term effects of screening on cancer mortality For example suppose that screening reduces cancer mortality up to five years after the last screening If one used the estimated difference in cancer mortality at the end of a 3 year follow up period this estimate would likely be biased relative to the true difference at 5 years Thus the longer the longer the follow up period up to some point the less chance for bias due to excluding long term effects of screening But as mentioned previously the longer the follow up period the greater the dilution Thus with longer follow up there is a variance bias tradeoff for estimating the difference in cancer mortality Because of this variance bias trade off the results of a randomized screening trial vary with the length of follow up after the last screening For example consider data from the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York HIP Study 12 in which approximately 62 000 women were randomized to either no screening or an invitation for four annual breast cancer screenings We estimated the reduction in the probability of cancer death among compliers at years 5 10 and 15 since randomization pretending each of these times was fixed in advance of the study Figure 1 At 5 and 10 years after randomization the lower bound of the 95 confidence interval was above zero however this was not the case for 15 years after randomization A major problem is how to best to analyze these data One approach is a limited mortality analysis 2 that counts cancer deaths over the entire follow up period but only among participants with cancer up to time t catch up after randomization The time t catch up is the time when the number of cases in the control group first equals or surpasses catches up to the number of cases in the intervention group The presumption is that cases surfacing after t catch up only dilute the estimated effect One problem is that t catch up does not occur if there is overdiagnosis A related problem is that t catch up might not occur for a very long time making its calculation impractical Another problem is that equal numbers of cases in both groups do not guarantee an unbiased test 13 A second approach is to test if screening reduces cancer mortality rates using a special weighted logrank statistic for survival data 14 15 A third approach is to select follow up times based on maximum power given parameter estimates from previous trials and the effect size that one would like to detect 16 As a fourth approach we propose a simple adaptive method to compute estimates and confidence intervals for the effect of screening when there is follow up after the last screen To the best of our knowledge this method is new to the screening literature In this analysis adaptive refers to using the data to select the follow up time with appropriate adjustment in computing confidence intervals Let p 0 t and p 1 t denote the cumulative fraction of subjects who die from cancer up to time t in the control and intervention groups respectively Letting n denote the number of subjects in each group we define z t p 0 t p 1 t Sqrt p 0 t p 1 t n which is the difference between p 0 t and p 1 t divided by its standard error i e the z value associated with a normally distributed random variable If screening reduces the probability of cancer death z t will generally increase over the time t that screening is offered and perhaps a little longer However at some point after screening has stopped z t will generally decrease over time because p 0 t and p 1 t will each increase by roughly the same amount from cases that arose after screening had stopped i e the effect of dilution See also 16 for a justification of this behavior of z t based on modeling natural history in breast cancer screening We assume that screening does not cause cancer deaths otherwise it would be possible for z t to decrease for reasons other than dilution This motivates selecting as the follow up time the time t that maximizes z t with an estimated effect of d causal t p 1 t p 0 t f 1 f 0 We interpret d causal t as the effect of receiving screening in compliers before dilution attenuates any effects For d causal t to be correctly interpretable as an effect of receiving screening we assume that after perhaps some initial fluctuations p 1 t p 0 t is generally increasing or constant over time until dilution reduces z t In other words although there may be a brief increase in cancer deaths due to screening soon after the start of the trial we assume that after screening stops screening does not start causing more cancer deaths than in the control group Otherwise we might incorrectly attribute a small difference between p 1 t p 0 t to the effect of dilution when it is due to delayed harms of screening and early treatment Computing confidence intervals by ignoring the fact that t was based on the data represents cutpoint optimization 17 and is thus inappropriate To compute a confidence interval for d causal t that accounts for the adaptive choice of t we use the following bootstrap 18 approach For purposes of illustration we applied this method to data in 2 on breast cancer screening from the Health Insurance Plan of Greater of New York HIP Study For each year after randomization we randomly generated a number of cancer deaths in each group based on a Poisson distribution with mean value equal to the observed number of deaths in that year and group From these randomly generated data we computed t and d causal t We repeated this calculation 10 000 times to obtain distributions for t and d causal t The mean value of these distributions is the estimate and the lower 2 5 and upper 97 5 quantiles gives the 95 confidence interval For t we obtained an estimate of 7 3 years with a 95 confidence interval of 4 to 13 years For d causal t the estimate and 95 confidence interval are shown in Figure 1 To compute sample size for a randomized trial with follow up after the last screening we propose the following approach to account for the adaptive nature of the test statistic The first step is to create anticipated data with m subjects per group under the null and alternative hypotheses The second step is to treat the anticipated data as observed data and compute bootstrap estimates of the variance Let v adpativeH0 and v adaptiveHA denote the bootstrap estimate of the variance divided by m under the null and alternative hypothesis respectively In other words v adpativeH0 and v adaptiveHA are the bootstrap estimates of variance for one subject The sample size with cancer death endpoint and adjustment for non attendance and contamination is N adaptive 2 1 96 Sqrt 2 v adpativeH0 84 Sqrt v adpativeH0 v adaptiveHA 2 d 2 f 1 f 0 2 One other issue in design is the duration of screening It should be sufficiently long so that any reduction in cancer mortality would be apparent before dilution has an effect Discussion In cancer therapy trials the standard statistical approach is an intent to treat analysis using a non adaptive statistic with an all death endpoint Why are we advocating a different approach for cancer screening trials On a fundamental level cancer screening trials differ from therapy trials because of the high amount of noise relative to the signal of screening effect This noise arises because cancer deaths are rare relative to all deaths non attendance and contamination immediately after randomization are common and discontinuation of screening leads to a dilution of cancer deaths due to cases arising after screening has stopped With the proposed analysis we can reduce the noise at the price of a few reasonable assumptions In using a cancer death endpoint with careful review of death records we assume that deaths caused by screening via unanticipated pathways such as cardiovascular disease are correctly attributed to screening In using the simple causal model to adjust for nonattendance and contamination we assume that i a subject who switches treatment immediately after randomization does in fact receive the same treatment as in the other treatment group and ii no subject would receive screening outside the trial if randomized to the control group and refuse screening if randomized to the intervention group In using the adaptive statistic to estimate the effect of screening in a trial with follow up after the end of screening we assume that screening does not increase cancer mortality after some point in time Even with the proposed method for reducing noise the sample sizes for randomized cancer screening trials are substantial typically requiring tens of thousands of subjects Thus randomized screening trials should only be undertaken when there is strong preliminary evidence for a potential benefit of screening that could outweigh attendant harms In this regard it is important to have a well designed strategy for selecting the most promising early detection markers for evaluation in a randomized cancer screening trial 19 20 21 Our focus has been on randomized trials for evaluating the efficacy of cancer screening and the attendant harms However observational studies have a role particularly when investigating secondary questions involving the effect of age to begin screening interval between screenings or small changes in the screening modality Case control studies are applicable with special considerations for cancer screening 22 Periodic Screening Evaluation PSE is a method for using data from subjects of various age who receive at least two regularly scheduled screenings to estimate the reduction in cancer mortality from periodic screening over a range of ages 23 24 The main assumptions of PSE are 1 once a cancer is detectable on screening it would be detectable on later screenings 2 given age year of birth adds no information for predicting the detection rate on the first screen 3 no selection bias in using refusers to estimate survival from detection in the absence of screening The paired availability design PAD is a method for combining data from various before and after studies that adjusts for different fraction receiving the intervention in a manner similar to that for nonattendance and contamination 25 For applications to screening PAD requires a well defined geographic region in which screening has been introduced with little in or out migration and no other changes over time that would affect the endpoint of cancer mortality We emphasized estimating the reduction if any in cancer deaths due to screening For a balanced evaluation one should also estimate the probability of an unnecessary biopsy 23 and other harms attendant to screening and interventions triggered by the screening process Conclusion The proposed guidelines combine recent methodological work on screening endpoints and noncompliance contamination with a new adaptive method to adjust for dilution in a study where follow up continues after the last screen They should greatly help investigators design and analyze randomized trials for the early detection of cancer Because the assumptions are reasonable we recommend these guidelines as one of the primary analyses Authors Contributions SGB wrote an initial draft and BSK and PCP made important improvements All
