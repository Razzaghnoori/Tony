 Background The fly visual system is characterized by its repetitive retinotopic organization of four layered structures the lamina the medulla the lobula and the lobula plate Every layer is composed of thousands of columns each of which contains the same number and types of neurons 1 2 In contrast to our detailed knowledge about the anatomy of these columnar elements not much is known about their visual response properties except for the large lamina monopolar cells 3 4 5 Due to the small diameter of the fibers intracellular recordings are hard to accomplish in most cases 6 7 8 9 Thus most data on columnar neurons arise from 2 deoxy glucose activity staining which however cannot easily be assigned to individual cell types 10 11 12 13 Nevertheless there exists anatomical evidence for at least three major parallel processing streams in the fly optic lobes 14 15 the first two pathways arise from receptor cells R1 6 which are connected through lamina cells L1 and L2 and transmedulla neurons to the lobula plate These two pathways are thought to be involved in motion processing The third pathway receives input from retinula cells R7 and R8 and by way of lamina cells L3 projects mainly to the lobula This pathway is supposed to be involved in the processing of form and color Amongst the best studied cells of the fly visual system are the large lobula plate tangential cells LPTCs which due to their large diameter axons about 8 10 microns are relatively easy to record from intracellularly LPTCs also possess a large dendritic arbor on which they receive input from numerous columnar elements arising presumably from the medulla and the lobula for review see 1 16 Many of these LPTCs do not produce regular action potentials but rather respond to excitatory or inhibitory stimuli by a graded shift of membrane potential 17 18 19 20 Typically LPTCs respond to visual motion in a directionally selective way They depolarize when stimulated by preferred direction motion and become inhibited by motion along the opposite or null direction According to our current view their direction selectivity is produced by the antagonistic action of local elements tuned to opposite directions of motion 21 These input elements are thought to be only weakly selective for the direction of motion The direction selectivity of the LPTCs is enhanced to such a high degree as it is observed in the electrical responses solely through the subtractive inhibition taking place on the dendrites of the LPTCs Evidence for this type of input arrangement comes from pharmacological experiments where the inhibitory input is blocked by PTX Under these conditions the preferred direction response is enlarged and the response to null direction is inverted resulting in an excitation 22 However all conclusions pertaining to the response properties of the input elements to the tangential cells are based on indirect evidence only since for the reasons outlined above only few intracellular recordings exist from them Another line along which to identify these input elements could be their transmitter system Here the tangential cells have been shown physiologically to possess at least two different transmitter receptors on their dendrite a cholinergic receptor with a typical nicotinic pharmacological profile and a aminobutyric acid GABA receptor 23 24 Antibodies against the ARD subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors nAChRs 25 26 and the RDL subunit of the GABA receptor 27 in Drosophila allowed us to investigate the distribution of these receptors in the fly visual system In the following we will present immunocytochemical data of antibody staining against nAChRs GABA receptors and the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA itself The distribution of immunoreactivity in the fly visual system for these receptors and GABA is analyzed and the putative pharmacology and cell types of the motion pathway are discussed Results Distribution of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor immunoreactivity We tested 3 different monoclonal antibodies which originally were generated against Drosophila nAChR subunits for their cross reactivity in the blowfly Calliphora erythrocephala Two of these antibodies were directed against ligand binding subunits ALS and D 2 whereas the third was directed against a structural subunit ARD of the Drosophila nAChR 25 28 Initial screening of ALS and D 2 sera showed no cross reactivity in western blots when Drosophila and Calliphora brain homogenates were compared data not shown Immunohistochemical staining with the ALS serum also failed to show immunoreactivity in brain cryostat sections from Calliphora in contrast to positive controls made in Drosophila data not shown Western blots with the ARD antibody mab 3D2 revealed multiple bands in Drosophila and Calliphora brain homogenates at approx 42 50 kD Fig 1a These are thought to correspond to the the ARD subunit which migrates at about 50 kD in denaturing gels and some proteolytic degradation products 26 In the Calliphora lane an additional band appeared at approx 100 kD of unknown origin It might represent a hetero or homo dimer of the subunit or cross reactivity with D 3 a novel subunit which migrates at 105 kDa and is associated with ARD 26 Cross reactivity is however not observed in Drosophila Fig 1a 26 Successful immunohistochemical staining with the ARD antibody in Calliphora depended strongly on the fixation method Fixation with 4 paraformaldehyd prevented positive immunoreactivity in Calliphora brain tissue In contrast fixation with FAA a mixture of formaldehyde ethanol and acetic acid resulted in clear ARD immunofluorescence in neuropilar regions of the visual system Fig 1b This staining pattern could be attributed to the binding of the primary antibody as shown by the control without the primary antibody in figure 1c ARD immunoreactivity in the visual system of Calliphora was clearly restricted to the synaptic neuropils the medulla the lobula and the lobula plate The inner chiasma a fiber tract between these three neuropils and the layer of somata posterior to the lobula plate did not show immunopositve staining for ARD Fig 1b The medulla revealed a multi layered pattern of ARD immunoreactivity Fig 1b 2a with a concentration of immunopositve signal in the inner medulla The layers with the terminals of the lamina monopolar cells L1 and L3 layers 1 3 and 5 showed higher levels of immunoreactivity than the layers containing the terminals of lamina monopolar cells L2 and of photoreceptors R7 R8 Fig 2a Especially layer 1 showed the highest levels of ARD immunoreactivity in most of the analyzed sections The lower level of ARD immunoreactivity in layer 4 with the terminals of photoreceptor R8 was not surprising as fly photoreceptors R1 6 and R8 are known to be histaminergic 29 30 31 32 Layer 6 with the terminals of the R7 photoreceptors in contrast shows some ARD immunoreactivity The serpentine layer which consists mainly of fibers had also a decreased level of ARD immunoreactivity Fig 1b 2a All three layers of the inner medulla were highly immunoreactive Layer 10 was somewhat weaker stained which might be due to a lower cell density in this layer compared to layers 8 and 9 Layer 10 contains the dendritic arborizations of the T4 cells which are presumed to represent input elements to the lobula plate tangential cells 14 Both lobula and lobula plate showed high overall ARD immunoreactivity with a less pronounced layering than the medulla Fig 1b The most posterior layer of the lobula containing the T5 cell dendrites was clearly distinguished from the rest of the lobula Fig 2b T5 cells project to the lobula plate and are thought to be another type of input elements to LPTCs 8 14 The lobula plate showed high levels of ARD immunoreactivity Fig 2b whereas the fibers in the inner chiasma contained almost no immunoreactivity The distal part of the lobula plate appeared to be divided into two immunoreactive layers which each might be further subdivided into two more sublayers Fig 2bleft side These layers would correspond to the functional representation of preferred motion direction with the LPTC responding to vertical motion in the two posterior layers and LPTCs sensitive to horizontal motion direction in the two anterior layers 11 13 Several profiles of large LPTCs were visible in the lobula late At the posterior edge of the lobula plate the main dendrites of the VS cells appeared as black and round cross sectioned profiles in this horizontal section Fig 2b These profiles were not surrounded by ARD immunoreactivity on their side facing away from the lobula plate suggesting that the main dendrites have a lower density of nAChRs than the higher order branches of the dendrites deeper within the neuropile Figure 2cgives a magnified view of the lobula plate with a clusters of dense ARD immunoreactivity arrow heads close to the VS cell dendrites The massive presence of ARD immunoreactivity emphasizes the importance of nicotinic cholinergic neurotransmission in the fly visual system Distribution of RDL immunoreactivity The RDL antibody is directed against the RDL subunit of the Drosophila GABA receptor In a previous study this antibody proved useful for the demonstration of GABA receptors in the Drosophila central nervous system 27 Cross reactivity of the serum could also be shown with GABA receptors in the mushroom bodies of the blowfly Calliphora erythrocephala 33 In the present study we were also able to identify significant RDL immunoreactivity in the visual system of Calliphora Figs 3a c when compared with control sections Figs 3b d RDL antibody preabsorbed with fusion protein RDL immunoreactivity was present in a layered organization in the medulla and the posterior lobula Fig 3a Labeling in the lobula plate was more evenly distributed Compared to the ARD immunoreactivity the RDL immunoreactivity was not restricted only to neuropilar regions but could also be found in perikarya surrounding the neuropils Figs 3a asterisks distal to the medulla posterior to the lobula plate and in the inner chiasma The location of the RDL immunopositive somata in the inner Fig 3a and outer chiasma Fig 3c arrows as well as the layered distribution of RDL immunoreactivity in the medulla matches well with medulla amacrine cells 34 neurons that interconnect multiple columns in one layer The most prominently labeled layer in the medulla was L1 In this layer several GABAergic tangential neurons are found see below as well as the presumably GABAergic centrifugal C2 neurons 35 In addition to L1 there were two more strata weakly labeled in the outer medulla a very thin portion of layer L3 and perhaps the proximal layer L1 The posterior layers of the lobula showed a similar pattern for RDL immunoreactivity as they do for ARD immunoreactivity Fig 3a e including the most posterior layer containing the dendritic ramifications of T5 neurons The lobula plate also showed significant RDL labeling although distinct layers do not appear as clearly as with the ARD antibody In summary GABA receptors seem to be widely present in the Calliphora visual system GABAergic elements in the visual system With the data presented on the distribution of GABA receptors in the visual system of Calliphora we were interested in the corresponding distribution of GABAergic neurons Although detailed accounts on GABA immunohistochemistry already exist in the literature 32 35 36 37 we wanted to make direct comparisons in our tissue material Furthermore some uncertainty remained in the studies cited above about the identity of columnar GABAergic elements namely Y cells 36 connecting the medulla with the lobula and lobula plate The monoclonal GABA antiserum which we used produced a staining pattern that was very similar to the results published in previous studies on the visual system of house and blowflies 35 36 37 indicating a specific binding of the antibody In particular we confirmed the GABA immunoreactive somata of putative C2 cells fine GABA positive profiles in the vicinity of VS dendrites and a bundle of large GABA positive axons at the proximal border of the lobula plate which were interpreted before as HS axons 37 GABAergic elements were found in all neuropils of the visual system In the medulla several layers distal and proximal L1 L3 contained GABA immunoreactive tangential neurons 36 Fig 4a The arrowheads in figure 4aindicate profiles of such tangential neurons that are shown in figure 4bin a whole mount preparation of the distal medulla The GABA immunoreactive somata in the inner chiasma probably correspond to the centrifugal C2 neurons There were also a few GABA immunoreactive somata in the soma cluster posterior to the lobula plate A cluster of GABA immunoreactive somata could be observed in the distal part of this area between the distal tip of the lobula plate and the medulla data not shown The lobula plate contained a high density of fine GABA immunoreactive profiles especially in the anterior part The main dendrites of VS cells were surrounded and contacted by many of these GABA immunoreactive profiles Fig 4a The inner chiasma contained GABA immunoreactive fibers Fig 4a c The horizontal section of the inner chiasma in Fig 4cshows the organization of fiber fascicles containing thick GABA immunoreactive fibers Although observed before 37 the projection of these fascicles has not been described so far There were two types of these columnar fiber fascicles The first type denoted here as type 1 projects directly from the medulla into the lobula plate The second type type 2 of fascicles contained fibers of columnar neurons projecting from the medulla to the lobula Figure 4dillustrates these two types of fascicles in a frontal section from the posterior part of the brain at the level of the lobula plate Type 1 fascicles which run parallel to the plane of section at this location project from the posterior medulla to the distal lobula plate Type 2 fascicles from the same part of the medulla run orthogonal to the plane of section to connect to the retinotopically corresponding part of the lobula and appear as cross sectioned profiles From this section it is clear that only type 2 fascicles contained GABA immunoreactive profiles Thus the pathway between medulla and lobula contained GABAergic elements while the pathway between the medulla and the lobula plate most likely did not Fig 4edepicts a thick axonal element in type 2 fascicles almost in full length in the inner chiasma connecting the medulla and the lobula According to Meyer et al 36 these thick axon profiles presumably represent Y cells However we were unable to positively identify any bifurcations in these axons projecting to the lobula plate Although the fiber in figure 4cseemed to have a side branch close inspection revealed that this branch originates from a fiber in a different fascicle Figure 4dshows the large profile of a LPTC probably of an HS cell As seen for the VS cell dendrites in figure 4a this profile apparently had contacts to fine GABA immunoreactive blebs too Discussion Distribution of nicotinic receptors Our staining pattern for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors as demonstrated with the ARD antibody resembles very closely the pattern observed originally in Drosophila 25 Before the availability of antibodies against nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of dipteran flies cholinergic pathways have been analyzed by more indirect methods mainly by immunocytochemistry against choline acetyltransferase ChAT an enzyme of the acetylcholine metabolism 38 39 or autoradiography of 125I bungarotoxin binding 40 41 The ARD subunit was shown to be associated with a distinct class of bungarotoxin binding sites in the Drosophila CNS 42 ChAT positive neurons would act complementarily as input elements of ARD immunoreactive elements However because of the wide abundance of acetylcholine in the insect CNS it is likely that ChAT positive neurons also possess nAChRs In fact the distribution patterns of ChAT in the lobula plate the lobula and the inner medulla are virtually identical with the pattern we observed with the ARD antibody In the outer medulla most layers match for the pattern of immunoreactivity to ChAT and ARD with exception of the terminal layer of L2 lamina monopolar cells which shows no ARD immunoreactivity but is reported to be ChAT immunopositive in Drosophila 38 In accordance with the ARD data there is also no labeling with 125I bungarotoxin in the L2 layer of the Drosophila medulla 40 It should be noted however that layer 10 in the medulla with the dendrites of T4 neurons and the posterior layer of the lobula with the dendrites of T5 neurons are slightly weaker in their ARD immunoreactivity than their adjacent neuropil layers In contrast the ChAT labeling in these two layers is much more intensive than that of the adjacent layers 38 The dense ARD labeling in the lobula plate did not allow the mapping of nAChRs to individual LPTCs However the concentration of ARD immunoreactivity in the region of the VS cell dendrites at the posterior border of the lobula plate is in accordance with our earlier findings of nicotinic receptor responses in these neurons 23 Distribution of GABA receptors and GABAergic neurons In our study the strongest GABA receptor immunoreactivity is in layer 1 L1 of the medulla The most likely columnar GABAergic element in this layer is the C2 cell type 36 37 The C2 cells have a presumably centrifugal projection back to the lamina and also arborizations in the medulla layers 5 L1 8 and 10 T4 We found RDL immunoreactivity in all these layers however to a lesser extent than in layer 1 Another possible source of GABA in the outer medulla are cells that form horizontal connections between columns GABA positive tangential neurons which are also found in layer 1 and amacrine cells which spread multiple columns The location of the cell bodies of deep medulla amacrine cells matches with the GABA immunoreactive somata in the inner chiasma The stratification patterns of these amacrine cells in turn matches with the RDL immunoreactivity pattern in the medulla GABAergic medulla tangential and amacrine cells are of special interest for considerations of cross column inhibitory interactions in the processing of visual motion information see below As outlined earlier lobula plate tangential cells LPTCs respond to cholinergic and GABAergic stimulation Our work and that of others show the presence of GABAergic profiles in the direct vicinity of LPTC dendrites However the identity of the columnar GABAergic cell types providing GABAergic input to LPTCs remains still elusive So far Y cells were assumed to be the most likely columnar GABAergic cell type 36 37 These statements however have to be evaluated with some caution because neither of these references presents direct evidence for GABAergic Y cells In Drosophila Y cells are characterized by thick fibers 2 which is in accordance with our observations of GABA immunoreactive fibers in the inner chiasma However we were not able to identify any bifurcated GABA immunoreactive fibers as one would expect in the case of Y cells T4 cells which are direct columnar input elements to some LPTCs 14 are unlikely to be GABAergic because the fascicles connecting directly between medulla and lobula plate did not contain any GABA immunoreactive fibers The other columnar cell type that is most likely to provide input to LPTCs are T5 cells originating in the lobula 14 From our results we cannot eliminate T5 cells as candidates of GABAergic inputs to LPTCs The Y cells though also remain likely candidates Possible role of GABA in motion detection In the original model of motion detection direction selectivity was proposed to arise in several consecutive processing stages 43 44 In the first step the retinal luminance levels of adjacent photoreceptors interact with each other in a nonlinear way after one of them is temporally low pass filtered This process is repeated in mirror symmetrical fashion In a second step the output signals of both operations become subtracted from each other Finally the outputs from all these local units are spatially pooled to result in a directionally selective wide field response With respect to our present picture of the cellular implementation the second and third processing step is thought to be realized on the dendrites of the lobula plate tangential cells while the first step of motion detection i e the nonlinear interaction probably takes place in small columnar neurons of the medulla and or lobula The presence of GABA receptors in layers of the medulla that take part in motion detection argue for a role of GABAergic transmission in the input pathway of lobula plate tangential cells Therefore GABA seems not only to play a role in the subtraction stage of the motion detection process 22 23 but is probably also involved in the nonlinear interaction between neighboring retinal locations In model simulations such a nonlinearity was accomplished by e g a multiplication 21 or a logical AND NOT gate 45 As has been shown such a computational task could be implemented at the cellular level by shunting inhibition 46 Comparison of immunostaining with activity labeling studies in Drososphila Our understanding of motion processing on the cellular level in the medulla is compared to the lobula plate very incomplete In particular the location and implementation of the nonlinear multiplicative interaction between the input channels remains elusive as outlined above Few attempts have been made to resolve this problem with intracellular recordings from medulla neurons 6 7 8 9 Another approach that has been taken was to label the activity in neuropils by means of 3H deoxyglucose 11 Visual motion stimuli i e rotating bars around the fly lead to a characteristic labeling pattern in the medulla Under these conditions layers 1 L1 2 L2 and 5 L1 showed increased 3H deoxyglucose uptake Layers 9 and 10 of the proximal medulla also were radioactively labeled 13 This demonstrates the participation of these layers in the transmission of relevant information for the processing of visual motion Comparing this to our results from the cholinergic and GABAergic receptor immunocytochemistry the L1 pathway layers 1 and 5 is the most likely to carry the relevant input signal for the non linear interaction through the medulla Conclusions Putative cellular constituents of the fly motion pathway In earlier studies two main candidates were proposed to constitute the elementary motion detector of the fly visual system the T4 and the T5 cells both types also called the bushy T cells 2 14 15 The reason why these cells are so suggestive candidates is that i both of these cells come in 4 different subtypes each of which ramifies in a different layer of the lobula plate 2 ii 3H deoxyglucose measurements using 4 cardinal directions of motion up down left right revealed a specific staining pattern of exactly these 4 layers in the lobula plate 11 Furthermore LPTCs occupy with their large dendrites preferentially those layers in the lobula plate which correspond to these different directions of motion 16 In one case a direct synaptic contact has been demonstrated at the EM level between a T4 cell and the dendrite of an HS cell 14 Taken the available immunocytochemical evidence presented in this paper together with what is known about the anatomy of columnar elements and the physiology of LPTCs the following picture about the cellular implementation of motion detection in the fly visual system can be drawn in the most parsimonious way The first major step of motion detection i e the non linear interaction between input channels is realized on the dendrites of T4 cells and the input elements of T5 cells in the proximal layer of the medulla by a combined cholinergic GABAergic mechanism This results in weakly directional signals for each of the four cardinal directions of motion split into a cholinergic pathway providing direct excitatory input onto the LPTC dendrites through T4 cells and an indirect GABAergic pathway relayed through the posterior layer of the lobula via T5 cells providing inhibitory input to LPTC dendrites Thus the second step in the computation of direction selectivity i e the subtraction is mediated by the opponent interaction between T4 and T5 cell input on the dendrites of each LPTC Finally these signals become integrated by the LPTC dendrite At present this proposal is highly speculative but may proof useful to be challenged in the future by electrophysiological or optical recordings from several of the putative constituents of the motion detection circuit Material and Methods Antibodies We used several different antibodies to map the distribution of nAChRs GABA receptors and GABAergic neurons respectively The monoclonal ARD antibody mab 3D2 was raised against a structural subunit of the nAChR from Drosophila 26 In the Drosophila nervous system mab 3D2 produces exactly the same staining pattern as that observed with polyclonal antisera against the ARD nAChR subunit 25 We also used the monoclonal antibody ALS mab D4 and a polyclonal serum D 2 both directed against like ligand binding subunits of the Drosophila nAChR 25 28 The polyclonal RDL antibody is directed against a Drosophila GABA receptor subunit 27 To detect GABAergic neurons we used a commercially available monoclonal antibody against GABA from Affinity Research Products Ltd GA 1160 Exeter UK Western blot Western blotting was used to demonstrate cross reactivity of the ARD antibody with Calliphora nAChR subunits For the preparation of membrane proteins brains from Calliphora erythrocephala and heads of Drosophila
