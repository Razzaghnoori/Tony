ENTITLED CHILD AND ADULT CARE FOOD PROGRAM IMPROVED TARGETING OF DAY CARE HOME REIMBURSEMENTS RIN 0584 AC42 i Cost benefit analysis The Department conducted a final economic impact analysis based on new Child and Adult Care Food Program CACFP data a recently completed study of the CACFP and comments received in connection with the analysis performed for the interim rule The final analysis found that based on the above the expected total federal savings for the 6 years covering fiscal years 1997 2002 will decline from the predicted 2 2 billion in the interim analysis to 1 7 billion The effects of the final rule are that non low income providers tier II and non low income families with children in tier II day care homes will bear most of the costs resulting from the government s savings Non low income households served by tier I day care homes will be unaffected by tiering The Department finds it is possible that some low income families with children in tier II day care homes may bear some of the costs but states may offset them by opting to increase child care subsidies ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 The Department prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in connection with the interim rule 62 Fed Reg 889 January 7 1997 which we found in our earlier report complied with the requirements of the act In the preamble to the final rule the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is discussed and the Department has found that the final rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities The small entities are composed of tier II day care home providers who will experience a large decrease in reimbursement rates for meals served GAO OGC 98 32 The analysis discusses the comments received in response to the initial analysis and the actions taken by the Department in response The Department points out that due to the programmatic changes mandated by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 there were no significant alternatives available that would both accomplish the objectives of the act and minimize any significant economic impact on the small entities iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C 1532 1535 The final rule does not impose a federal mandate as defined by title II of the act on either state local or tribal governments or the private sector of 100 million or more in any one year iv Other relevant information or requirements under
