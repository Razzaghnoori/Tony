 May 22 2000 Thank you for your interest in the Peace Education Program The Peace Education Program in conjunction with a network of adults in our schools and neighborhoods works firsthand with young people who we feel are the hope for the future We provide youth with options to stand up for themselves and resolve conflicts nonviolently We teach conflict resolution peer mediation and the principles of prejudice reduction not just in Louisville s neighborhoods and schools but also throughout Kentucky With over 18 years experience we have found that many conflicts between young people are rooted in attitudes and prejudices that exclude and target individuals and groups By shifting attitudes and teaching youth to understand each other we halt the violence that plagues our schools and neighborhoods Our commitment to schools and neighborhoods has a long tested record of accomplishment We have worked hard to create a strong school neighborhood linkage or safety net School suspensions are down in Jefferson County and we are part of the answer see attached article Enclosed are additional materials to illustrate the commitment of Peace Education Program to giving youth more than a fighting chance Peace LaDonna R Murphy Office Manager
