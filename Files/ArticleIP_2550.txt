 Citizen Bandwidth How fast can you read this How fast will your computer keyboard accept the characters you type How fast does water flow out of your kitchen faucet The answers depend on bandwidth Simply put bandwidth is a measurement of how much how quickly The speed at which your brain absorbs words words per minute your computer accepts keystrokes characters per second or your faucet squirts water gallons per minute can be described in terms of bandwidth The rate at which computers can send and receive information is expressed in bandwidth too as bits per second Surveys tell us that most readers connect to Slate with 28 8 modems which under optimal conditions deliver a bandwidth of 28 800 bits of data per second What s a bit A bit is the smallest unit of data either a zero or a one For example eight bits represent a single letter in the alphabet The eight letter word alphabet contains 64 bits The average Slate article and I just happen to have one right here Booker Snooker contains about 800 000 bits of text images and formatting information It takes about 30 seconds to download via a 28 8 modem Let s do the math Eight hundred thousand bits divided by 28 800 bits per second equals 27 8 seconds Software developers like me lust for more bandwidth and so do civilians like you who only use computers We all want Slate and ESPN Sportszone and Amazon com to download faster to our computers Bandwidth Bandwidth Bandwidth the masses cry But ever since mankind first took serious notice of bandwidth ever since the invention of Morse code that is there hasn t been enough of it An average telegrapher can communicate at 20 to 40 words per minute That s about 16 to 32 bits per second If your computer operated at Morse code s bandwidth it would take between a half day and a full day to download a page from Slate The bandwidth bottleneck bugs me because we ve seen dramatic increases in performance on almost every other computer front A 1985 processor 386 ran at 12 MHz A 1997 Pentium II processor runs at 300 MHz about 20 times faster Over that same time the storage capacity of the average computer has grown by a factor of 250 But usable bandwidth for the home user has increased only about threefold Have the bandwidth guys been taking long lunches or what Actually they ve been doing a great job it s the rotten telephone companies that have been lollygagging Everybody has heard about Moore s Law named after an Intel founder which holds that the power of CPUs doubles every 18 months There s a corresponding bandwidth law named after its discoverer right wing techno utopian George Gilder which states that bandwidth triples every 12 months And it has been tripling every 12 months for the last decade or so The phone companies haven t piped this wonderful bandwidth into most homes yet because they re fairly happy with the quaint technology of copper wire they ve installed over the last century Copper wire telephone connections have enough bandwidth to transmit voices but not enough for gluttons like me Click for an explanation of Shannon s Limit which tells you why the bandwidth of conventional telephone connections will never exceed 56 000 bits per second If you re lucky your friendly neighborhood telephone monopoly provides ISDN service in your town ISDN stands for integrated services digital network and the technology moves data to computers at 128 000 bits per second That s five times faster than a regular modem which means you can download the average Slate page in about six seconds The service isn t cheap In Seattle the phone company charges about 100 for ISDN installation and about 65 a month for flat rate access The ISDN modem itself will set you back about 200 ISDN is the most popular alternative to conventional modems Slate s Washington D C offices connect to the Web and the Redmond mothership through ISDN The best bandwidth is free bandwidth For most people that means a T1 connection at work or school In New York City some Net savvy landlords are outfitting apartment buildings with T1 service I wish those landlords would buy my building in Seattle Like ISDN T1 breaks the 56 000 bits per second barrier by going 100 percent digital that is by transmitting ones and zeros instead of the up and down waves of an analog signal For a more detailed explanation of how ISDN T1 and other ultrafast technologies work click T1 transmits data at 1 5 million bits per second delivering Slate articles in about half a second Of course your mileage may vary depending on how many users are connected to your T1 line how busy the Internet or Slate s Web site might be at the moment and how clogged your local area network might be You can only move so much data through the pipe at a time But you want faster Some phone companies are offering test trials of a new technology ADSL or asymmetric digital subscription line Right now ADSL is ridiculously expensive more than 1 000 for the modem alone But it s also ridiculously fast Connection speeds are around 8 million bits per second from the Internet to you and about 800 000 bits per second from you to the Internet It would take only one tenth of one second to download a Slate article via ADSL If ISDN or ADSL haven t come to your block and you want to punish the phone companies for their intransigence try the DirecPC satellite service from Hughes Electronics The first question you should ask yourself is Are you man enough for DirecPC s 400 000 bits per second bandwidth The company s Web site sets down these specific restrictions among others You must have 1 an u nobstructed line of site to the South from your home or office and 2 n o tolerance for waiting DirecPC beams the Internet from Hughes satellites to personal dishes and then into users computers Please allow two seconds for Slate pages to download DirecPC is a bad choice for those who want to transmit data because it uplinks on conventional phone lines at a paltry 28 800 bits per second Another bandwidth initiative Broadcast PC will exploit the unused bandwidth in broadcast television signals to beam content This one way connection will offer speeds up to 150 000 bits per second The bandwidth to end all bandwidth comes to you from another despicable monopoly your local cable guy The cleverly named Silicon Valley start up Home promises 30 million bits per second of bandwidth through cable TV lines Theoretically Home can deliver a Slate page in 0 0266 seconds The company has forged alliances with several cable companies such as Comcast full disclosure Microsoft recently invested 1 billion in Comcast and Cox to provide service Analysts say cable modem service will be ubiquitous by the turn of the century Sounds like nirvana right The big gotcha is that 30 million bits per second is faster than the Internet connects to itself Many Web sites connect to the Internet through T1 lines which you recall have a bandwidth of 1 5 million bits per second Because your Internet connection is no faster than your slowest link you won t see a Web page in 0 0266 seconds unless it is stored on the Home computer Slate throws a fire hose at this problem and connects to the Internet through a DS3 line which has a bandwidth of 45 million bits per second If Gilder s Law is correct bandwidth will soon be cheaper than air But will the bandwidth explosion be undermined by Shuman s Law Shuman s Law holds that you can count on talented twentysomething software developers like Shuman to write big stinking pieces of software that will swallow all your expanding computer resources your processor your hard disk your memory and your bandwidth resulting in no net performance gains Already talented twentysomething software developers are laying plans to choke the cable enhanced Internet with full motion video one feature length movie contains almost 17 gigabytes of data or 136 billion bits virtual reality games assorted business applications XXX live smut and Webzines about politics and culture Actually I think that the young software developers will be swamped by a bandwidth tsunami and that we re entering the age of experience on the Web predicted by Peter Cochrane top research geek at BT Networks and Systems Soon the Web will transmit what Cochrane calls full expertise If a picture is worth 1 000 words he writes and a moving picture is worth 1 000 000 words then an interactive pictographic world of a supercharged Web is worth 1 000 000 000 words Bandwidth permitting anything that can be done in meatspace will be doable in virtual space I just hope that by the time I m scheduled for remote double bypass surgery the Web no longer transmits 404 Site Not Found errors
