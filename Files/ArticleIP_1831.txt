 Charles Earl Spencer Last week Britain lost a princess and found a hero Charles Earl Spencer the angriest brother in the world Spencer s vitriolic anti press anti monarchy eulogy was wildly popular in the United Kingdom it s been called one of the most important speeches in recent British history and reprinted by all the vile tabloids it denounces Spencer has invented a literary genre the Attack Eulogy You might think that Spencer s plummy accent Hugh Grant y good looks and lordly manner well he is a lord would make Britons nostalgic for the good old days Remember when toffs were really toffee But the earl is a very new very modern and almost American kind of aristocrat The stiff upper lip has been replaced by the barbed blabbing tongue reticence by confession traditionalism by populism Spencer s eulogy which did as much to settle scores as to commemorate his sister did not surprise anyone who s followed the earl over the years The 33 year old Spencer has nursed a grudge against the press since Diana s marriage to Prince Charles interrupted his boisterous adolescence Fame was thrust upon him and he didn t like it much In a normal aristocratic family Spencer would have been just another playboy But he was the Princess of Wales younger brother so his noble pursuits i e wine women song became tabloid fodder His escapades Eton roughhousing Oxford carousing riotous birthday parties speeding tickets made headlines Fleet Street dubbed him Champagne Charlie His many model girlfriends decorated gossip columns much to his annoyance Of course the models wouldn t have been his girlfriends if it hadn t been for the earl s high profile Spencer s rage at the press has grown in recent years and with much justification In 1995 the News of the World publicized his wife s alcoholism and anorexia or to use that excellent British phrase a slimming disease and snapped surreptitious pictures of her at a private treatment facility When his best friend committed jewel fraud the Daily Express falsely accused Spencer of abetting the criminal Another paper falsely accused him of selling black market tickets to the Bolshoi Ballet A paparazzo in South Africa where Spencer has lived since 1995 sneaked into his home as a domestic worker and photographed him Spencer has fought back repeatedly winning damages from papers that intruded on or defamed him But like the British public which demands more celebrity photos even as it shouts for journalists blood Earl Spencer has a much more ambivalent read hypocritical relationship with the press than he pretends to have He uses the media as much as he is abused by it a trait he shared with Diana A few months after he married for example Spencer slept with an old girlfriend in Paris She was preparing to sell her story to the tabloids when Spencer pre empted her He confessed his adultery to a sympathetic Daily Mail columnist got his soft pedaled version of the story published and escaped serious damage In the old days this would have been called Today it is spin control On another occasion Spencer went on a talk show and discussed his sex fantasies Roman orgies if you re curious The earl has even practiced the very journalism he decries For much of the last decade he has been a correspondent for NBC and British networks covering celebrities and the aristocracy His first TV assignment no joke was to serve up royal gossip for NBC at the wedding of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson The earl takes an equally modern and practical approach to his noble heritage He s worth more than 100 million but most of the fortune is tied up in land and antiques He needs cash flow to maintain his 121 room mansion and 13 000 acre estate and he s been savvy about finding it A few years ago he raised 336 000 by auctioning four of his lesser titles including Lord of Wimbledon The titles were purely symbolic they carry no land and no seat in the House of Lords but the sale nonetheless horrified traditionalists He has hocked heirlooms to pay taxes rented his mansion out for conferences and banquets proposed turning 500 wooded acres of his estate into a housing development and leased the grounds for concerts One of the most admired lines in the earl s eulogy was his promise to Diana that the Spencer family will do all it can to ensure that Princes William and Harry are not simply immersed by duty and tradition but can sing openly as you planned He presents his royal nephews with an awkward choice Charles the prince or Charles the earl One is hidebound stiff silent in the face of media criticism The other is entrepreneurial telegenic noisy and restrained by no tradition One is Britain s past the other is its present
