to prudence slate com Queries should not exceed 200 words in length Please indicate how you wish your letter to be signed preferably including your location Dear Prudie Larry is an exceedingly good friend and when he comes to my city on business it s understood that I am delighted to take him out on the town put him up in my guest room etc Ditto for when I m in his city As we re both computer geeks when we happen to be going to the same trade show or conference night life plans and party invites for me automatically include Larry and vice versa Enter The Problem in the form of Moe a common acquaintance of Larry s and mine who sometimes attends the same conferences Moe simply invites himself along to everything Larry and I do for the whole week If he gets wind of our plans he ll turn up to meet us If he hasn t overheard anything he ll simply tag along with one of us all day until lunch or dinner or whatever We have attempted to gently give Moe the message that he s not welcome unless invited but it just bounces off Moe s tact proof armor Prudie HELP Moe s not a jerk he s just clueless and Larry and I are agreed that we d just like the freakin option of him not joining us We d like to achieve this without actually being forced to tell him to off but we re nearing our rope s end Shemp in Seattle Dear Shemp Prudie deplores the density of your cyberclod friend and sees no reason for you and Larry to have to be stealth geeks Since you ve tried tact you must now be direct with this judgment free fellow Simply tell him you hate like hell to hurt his feelings but you and Larry use these gatherings to catch up and a third party simply changes the dynamic It is alas poor manners to ever tell anyone to off You must be benevolent despots lest you find yourself manipulated by someone with the hide of a rhinoceros Gird your loins make your statement and brook no further discussion roger and out Prudie determinedly Dear Prudence We are often invited to parties and dinners at some really splendid homes owned by wealthy acquaintances and clients of both my husband and me Should we invite these young wealthies back to our comparatively humble small home They know we are not in their league financially but we feel a little sheepish inviting them to view our worn upholstery and carpets We wonder if they too would feel uncomfortable with our differences made so plainly apparent Should we just muster our courage and invite them over or should we invite them for dinner drinks at a restaurant Would this seem impersonal and contrived Stuck in the Middle Class Toronto Dear Stuck It has been Prudie s experience that when invited to a simple home she has often been impressed The hosts in such a situation usually are genuine confident and wise people genuine because they are who they are confident because they know where the real values lie and wise because they understand that putting on the dog is pointless People of quality do not choose friends on the basis of their possessions Restaurant entertaining is becoming fashionable however and Prudie would recommend that for you if that choice would not come from shame and if you would have a better evening yourselves Prudie entertainingly Dear Prudie I am a young woman who has made the unfortunate mistake of falling in love with my friend I say unfortunate because he happens to be gay We both graduated together with the same major art history I have admired his intelligence and sensitivity for a long time If it was not for him I am sure I wouldn t have done nearly as well in my studies But I did not expect to become romantically involved He has asked me to go to Europe with him and I do not know what to do about it If I tell him how I really feel I fear he will want to end everything And yet the longer I am with him the worse it gets and the harder it becomes to hide my true feelings Should I go to Europe I would rather be with him than nothing at all Thank you Confused Dear Con Ah yes the old story of a woman falling for one of nature s bachelors If it s any consolation to you this occurrence is not all that rare In fact Prudie cast her eye in that direction while in college when ice covered the earth It is a truism that straight or gay certain people are going to have electricity for certain other people Occasionally a homosexual person will experiment in the other arena Prudie can think of two show business examples one British and dead the other American and living Both these gay men gave a romantic whirl to their leading ladies though the relationships were short lived As a general rule sexuality is hard wired and that s that Prudie feels it important to point out that when you write you are romantically involved it is only you experiencing the romance or the involvement Prudie believes in the interest of your mental health that you confess your feelings thereby relieving yourself of the stress and pain of a fantasy love affair When you fess up and your friend may already have figured things out you might ask if there is any reciprocal inclination If not your cards will be on the table and together you can decide if the friendship continues platonically or if it seems best to put things on ice You need a resolution and better sooner than later Prudie resolutely Dear Prudence This guy I met but never dated at work left for the West Coast about five months ago When he was preparing to leave I wrote him a letter explaining my unease about his departure because I felt we had somehow missed our chance at what could have been a real relationship I wrote it in the summer and I still have it Never mailed it Without my explaining how or why I feel the loss more now than ever Can you tell me whether I should mail the letter I ll spare you the more complicated question of the mystical power of love xxxooo nyc Dear xxx Interesting that you wrote the letter but kept it Now that almost half a year has past Prudie suggests a compromise Send the object of your affections a letter but a different one a new one Write to say that you ve become aware of missing his presence and wonder how things are going on the left coast If he answers and if the answer is at all responsive keep the correspondence going If things start to look promising Prudie suggests you find it suddenly necessary to visit your favorite aunt college roommate former dog trainer anybody in the city wherein the correspondent resides Prudie plottingly
