 In what is usually referred to as the most famous experiment in embryology Hans Spemann and Hilde Mangold 1924 showed that a specific region in early frog embryos called the blastopore lip can induce a second complete embryonic axis including the head when transplanted to a host embryo Most of the axis including the nervous system was derived from the host whose cells were induced to form an axis by the graft therefore named the organizer Induction refers to the change in fate of a group of cells in response to signals from other cells The signal receiving cells must be capable of responding a property termed competence The Spemann Mangold organizer which as the transplantation experiment shows is able to turn cells whose original fate would be gut or ventral epidermis into brain or somites is the prototypical inducing tissue And neural induction has for a long time been regarded as a process by which organizer signals in their normal context redirect ectodermal cells from an epidermal towards a neural fate The nature of the neural inducer or inducers and the mechanism of neural induction have been and remain hot topics in developmental biology For half a century after Spemann and Mangold studies on amphibians monopolized the subject and even more recently a large part of the progress in analyzing organizer formation and function and neural induction was based on amphibians mostly the model species Xenopus laevis In the past few years however work in other vertebrate and nonvertebrate chordate systems has come to play an important role in the field and has shed light on generalities and differences among chordates If the present primer uses Xenopus to illustrate the process it is because it accompanies an article in this issue of PLoS Biology dealing with neural development in this species Kuroda et al 2004 and of course because of the experience of this author Here I shall outline the understanding of organizer formation and neural induction as it has evolved over recent times and attempt to integrate recent results from different species into a common pattern Cortical Rotation and Nuclear Localization of Catenin The frog egg is radially symmetrical around the animal vegetal axis that has been established during oogenesis Fertilization triggers a rotation of the cortex relative to the cytoplasm that is associated with the movement of dorsal determinants from the vegetal pole to the future dorsal region of the embryo Gerhart et al 1989 A brief parenthetical point is in order here Conventionally the side of the amphibian and fish embryo where the organizer forms has been called dorsal with the opposite side labeled as ventral This axis assignment does not project unambiguously onto the clearly defined dorsal ventral polarity of the larva as pointed out forcefully in recent publications Lane and Smith 1999 Lane and Sheets 2000 2002 In these papers a new proposal is made for polarity assignments in the gastrula that I believe has some merit but also presents some difficulties As the conventional approach of equating organizer side with dorsal seems to remain in wide use at present I shall apply this convention albeit with the reservation above While the nature of the dorsal determinants is still in dispute it is clear that the consequence of their translocation is the nuclear localization of catenin in a wide arc at the future organizer side Figure 1 Schneider et al 1996 Schohl and Fagotto 2002 Nuclear localization of catenin appears to be the first event that determines dorsal ventral polarity in the Xenopus and zebrafish embryos Hibi et al 2002 No comparable early event appears to be involved in amniote e g chick and mouse embryos Induction by the Organizer Antagonizing Bone Morphogenetic Protein As gastrulation starts the Spemann Mangold organizer which includes mostly axial mesodermal precursors was classically believed to instruct na ve ectoderm to convert to neural tissue In transplant or explant studies animal ectoderm that forms epidermis when undisturbed is susceptible to neural induction by the organizer This fact prompted a search for neural inducers that eventually led to the identification of several substances with the expected properties organizer products that can neuralize ectoderm Their molecular properties were at first surprising they proved to be antagonists of other signaling factors mostly of bone morphogenetic proteins BMPs and also of WNT a secreted protein homologous to the Drosophila Wingless protein and Nodal factors Sasai and De Robertis 1997 Hibi et al 2002 These observations led to the formulation of a default model of neural induction Weinstein and Hemmati Brivanlou 1997 which states that ectodermal cells will differentiate along a neural pathway unless induced to a different fate The heuristic simplicity and logical cogency of this model facilitated its wide acceptance although it did not explain the processes that set the default Some of these processes have been the subject of subsequent studies that were conducted in several different species and this has led to a more refined and probably more accurate picture The Role of Fibroblast Growth Factor For example additional signaling pathways are now known to operate Recent work on neural induction comes to two major conclusions i the fibroblast growth factor FGF signaling pathway plays a major role in this process and ii neural specification starts well before gastrulation and thus before the formation and function of the organizer Studies on the role of FGF in early Xenopus development initially discovered its role in mesoderm induction and the formation of posterior tissues Kimelman et al 1992 And while the involvement of FGF in neuralization was observed early in this system Lamb and Harland 1995 Launay et al 1996 Hongo et al 1999 Hardcastle et al 2000 in view of the impressive effects seen with Chordin and other BMP pathway antagonists the relevance of FGF in neural specification in amphibians and fish was slow to be recognized It took elegant studies mostly in chick embryos Streit et al 2000 and their eloquent exposition Streit and Stern 1999 Wilson and Edlund 2001 Stern 2002 to turn the tide but there is now no doubt that the FGF signaling pathway plays a major role in the specification and early development of the neural ectoderm in chordates FGF does not seem to behave as a classical organizer derived neural inducer however Maternal FGF mRNA and protein appear to be widely distributed in the early embryo and at least one FGF family member is expressed primarily in the animal pre ectodermal region during blastula stages Song and Slack 1996 A detailed study of the regions where different signaling pathways are active during embryogenesis Schohl and Fagotto 2002 showed that the entire ectoderm is probably exposed to FGF signals at or prior to the time of neural induction with the more vegetal mesoderm proximal region of the ectoderm being exposed to higher levels Thus exposure to FGF is required to endow the ectoderm with the competence to respond to additional signals that will act later on its way towards neural specification Such a process was deduced from experiments in the chick where an FGF signal must be followed by exposure to organizer signals to sensitize the tissue to BMP antagonists that ultimately stabilize the neural fate Stern 2002 An exciting recent study shows that exposure of the epiblast ectoderm to FGF induces after a time delay a transcription factor named Churchill Churchill expression inhibits cell ingression leading to mesoderm formation the cells remaining in the epiblast assume a neural fate Sheng et al 2003 The time delay in Churchill induction appears to be the key in explaining how one signal FGF can be involved in mesodermal and neural development at the same time in cells that are in close proximity The question how FGF signaling can lead to different outcomes was also addressed in a study on neural specification in ascidians Bertrand et al 2003 Here the FGF signal leads to neural induction through the coordinated activation of two transcription factors Ets1 2 and GATAa whereas FGF does not activate GATAa during its function in mesoderm formation Thus similar input leads to distinct output as a result of different responses by target tissues stressing the importance of competence in this inductive process Molecular Predisposition Not surprisingly then attention has turned to the target tissues and to the prepatterns that might already exist In Xenopus it was long known that the animal region or pre ectoderm is not uniform or na ve in that the dorsal organizer proximal region is predisposed towards a neural fate Sharpe et al 1987 The paper by Kuroda et al 2004 adds much information about neural specification before gastrulation in Xenopus and the factors involved in this process The authors identify a region in the dorsal ectoderm of the blastula that they name the blastula Chordin and Nogginexpressing or BCNE region Figure 2 They show that this region which I prefer to simply call dorsal ectoderm expresses siamois chordin and Xnr3 another catenin target The dorsal ectoderm or BCNE is fully specified as anterior neural ectoderm as excision of this region led to headless embryos and explants differentiated into neural tissue in culture even when the formation of any mesodermal cells was blocked by interference with nodal signaling Kuroda et al 2004 Kuroda et al 2004 further show that induction of anterior neural tissue initiated by catenin requires Chordin whereas formation of posterior neural tissue does not This latter point concerns an issue not yet mentioned here namely anterior posterior patterning of the neural ectoderm a process that occurs in concert with neural induction per se This patterning appears to involve the interaction of various signaling factors including FGF BMP WNT and retinoic acid all of which act as posteriorizing factors Kudoh et al 2002 Suppression of BMP signaling by expression of its antagonists is the condition that specifies the dorsal ectoderm or BCNE as future anterior neural ectoderm in contrast posterior neural ectoderm may form under the influence of FGF even in the presence of BMP signaling The work by Kuroda et al 2004 thus shows that initial specification of anterior neural ectoderm in Xenopus as in other vertebrates takes place before gastrulation and does not require organizer signals this is not to say that full differentiation and patterning of the nervous system could be achieved without organizer participation Induction and Competence The formation of the vertebrate nervous system thus depends on multiple signaling pathways such as the FGF BMP and WNT signaling cascades that interact in complex ways e g Pera et al 2003 In contrast to the classical view neural induction is not exclusively promoted by organizer derived signals in that earlier signals and intrinsic processes that determine ectodermal competence are prominently involved Whether inductive signals or competence of responding tissue is more important in embryology has been debated much like the nature nurture controversy in the behavioral arena Current work has given some boost to the competence side of the argument but as in behavior the truth lies somewhere in between though not necessarily at the halfway mark Studies such as those discussed here bring us closer to finding the answer to this question
