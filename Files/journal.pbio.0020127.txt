                            In what is usually referred to as the most famous experiment in embryology Hans Spemann        and Hilde Mangold  showed that a specific region in early frog embryos called the        blastopore lip can induce a second complete embryonic axis including the head when        transplanted to a host embryo Most of the axis including the nervous system was derived        from the host whose cells were induced to form an axis by the graft therefore named the        organizer Induction refers to the change in fate of a group of cells in response to        signals from other cells The signalreceiving cells must be capable of responding a        property termed competence The SpemannMangold organizer whichas the transplantation        experiment showsis able to turn cells whose original fate would be gut or ventral        epidermis into brain or somites is the prototypical inducing tissue And neural induction        has for a long time been regarded as a process by which organizer signals in their normal        context redirect ectodermal cells from an epidermal towards a neural fate The nature of        the neural inducer or inducers and the mechanism of neural induction have been and remain        hot topics in developmental biology        For half a century after Spemann and Mangold studies on amphibians monopolized the        subject and even more recently a large part of the progress in analyzing organizer        formation and function and neural induction was based on amphibians mostly the model        species         Xenopus laevis  In the past few years however work in other        vertebrate and nonvertebrate chordate systems has come to play an important role in the        field and has shed light on generalities and differences among chordates If the present        primer uses         Xenopus to illustrate the process it is because it accompanies        an article in this issue of         PLoS Biology dealing with neural development in this species Kuroda et        al  and of course because of the experience of this author Here I shall outline        the understanding of organizer formation and neural induction as it has evolved over recent        times and attempt to integrate recent results from different species into a common        pattern                    Cortical Rotation and Nuclear Localization of Catenin        The frog egg is radially symmetrical around the animalvegetal axis that has been        established during oogenesis Fertilization triggers a rotation of the cortex relative to        the cytoplasm that is associated with the movement of dorsal determinants from the vegetal        pole to the future dorsal region of the embryo Gerhart et al  A brief        parenthetical point is in order here Conventionally the side of the amphibian and fish        embryo where the organizer forms has been called dorsal with the opposite side labeled as        ventral This axis assignment does not project unambiguously onto the clearly defined        dorsalventral polarity of the larva as pointed out forcefully in recent publications        Lane and Smith  Lane and Sheets   In these papers a new proposal is made        for polarity assignments in the gastrula that I believe has some merit but also presents        some difficulties As the conventional approach of equating organizer side with dorsal        seems to remain in wide use at present I shall apply this convention albeit with the        reservation above        While the nature of the dorsal determinants is still in dispute it is clear that the        consequence of their translocation is the nuclear localization of catenin in a wide arc        at the future organizer side Figure  Schneider et al  Schohl and Fagotto         Nuclear localization of catenin appears to be the first event that determines        dorsalventral polarity in the         Xenopus and zebrafish embryos Hibi et al  No comparable        early event appears to be involved in amniote eg chick and mouse embryos                    Induction by the Organizer Antagonizing Bone Morphogenetic Protein        As gastrulation starts the SpemannMangold organizer which includes mostly axial        mesodermal precursors was classically believed to instruct nave ectoderm to convert to        neural tissue In transplant or explant studies animal ectoderm that forms epidermis when        undisturbed is susceptible to neural induction by the organizer This fact prompted a        search for neural inducers that eventually led to the identification of several substances        with the expected propertiesorganizer products that can neuralize ectoderm Their        molecular properties were at first surprising they proved to be antagonists of other        signaling factors mostly of bone morphogenetic proteins BMPs and also of WNT a secreted        protein homologous to the         Drosophila Wingless protein and Nodal factors Sasai and De        Robertis  Hibi et al  These observations led to the formulation of a default        model of neural induction Weinstein and HemmatiBrivanlou  which states that        ectodermal cells will differentiate along a neural pathway unless induced to a different        fate The heuristic simplicity and logical cogency of this model facilitated its wide        acceptance although it did not explain the processes that set the default Some of these        processes have been the subject of subsequent studies that were conducted in several        different species and this has led to a more refined and probably more accurate        picture                    The Role of Fibroblast Growth Factor        For example additional signaling pathways are now known to operate Recent work on        neural induction comes to two major conclusions i the fibroblast growth factor FGF        signaling pathway plays a major role in this process and ii neural specification starts        well before gastrulation and thus before the formation and function of the organizer        Studies on the role of FGF in early         Xenopus development initially discovered its role in mesoderm        induction and the formation of posterior tissues Kimelman et al  And while the        involvement of FGF in neuralization was observed early in this system Lamb and Harland         Launay et al  Hongo et al  Hardcastle et al  in view of the        impressive effects seen with Chordin and other BMP pathway antagonists the relevance of        FGF in neural specification in amphibians and fish was slow to be recognized It took        elegant studies mostly in chick embryos Streit et al  and their eloquent        exposition Streit and Stern  Wilson and Edlund  Stern  to turn the tide        but there is now no doubt that the FGF signaling pathway plays a major role in the        specification and early development of the neural ectoderm in chordates        FGF does not seem to behave as a classical organizerderived neural inducer however        Maternal FGF mRNA and protein appear to be widely distributed in the early embryo and at        least one FGF family member is expressed primarily in the animal preectodermal region        during blastula stages Song and Slack  A detailed study of the regions where        different signaling pathways are active during embryogenesis Schohl and Fagotto         showed that the entire ectoderm is probably exposed to FGF signals at or prior to the time        of neural induction with the more vegetal mesodermproximal region of the ectoderm being        exposed to higher levels Thus exposure to FGF is required to endow the ectoderm with the        competence to respond to additional signals that will act later on its way towards neural        specification Such a process was deduced from experiments in the chick where an FGF        signal must be followed by exposure to organizer signals to sensitize the tissue to BMP        antagonists that ultimately stabilize the neural fate Stern         An exciting recent study shows that exposure of the epiblast ectoderm to FGF induces        after a time delay a transcription factor named Churchill Churchill expression inhibits        cell ingression leading to mesoderm formation the cells remaining in the epiblast assume a        neural fate Sheng et al  The time delay in Churchill induction appears to be the        key in explaining how one signal FGF can be involved in mesodermal and neural development        at the same time in cells that are in close proximity The question how FGF signaling can        lead to different outcomes was also addressed in a study on neural specification in        ascidians Bertrand et al  Here the FGF signal leads to neural induction through        the coordinated activation of two transcription factors Ets and GATAa whereas FGF does        not activate GATAa during its function in mesoderm formation Thus similar input leads to        distinct output as a result of different responses by target tissues stressing the        importance of competence in this inductive process                    Molecular Predisposition        Not surprisingly then attention has turned to the target tissues and to the        prepatterns that might already exist In         Xenopus  it was long known that the animal region or        preectoderm is not uniform or nave in that the dorsal organizerproximal region is        predisposed towards a neural fate Sharpe et al  The paper by Kuroda et al         adds much information about neural specification before gastrulation in         Xenopus and the factors involved in this process The authors        identify a region in the dorsal ectoderm of the blastula that they name the blastula        Chordin and Nogginexpressing or BCNE region Figure  They show that this region        which I prefer to simply call dorsal ectoderm expresses         siamois          chordin  and         Xnr  another catenin target The dorsal ectoderm or BCNE is fully        specified as anterior neural ectoderm as excision of this region led to headless embryos        and explants differentiated into neural tissue in culture even when the formation of any        mesodermal cells was blocked by interference with nodal signaling Kuroda et al         Kuroda et al  further show that induction of anterior neural tissue initiated by        catenin requires Chordin whereas formation of posterior neural tissue does not This        latter point concerns an issue not yet mentioned here namely anteriorposterior patterning        of the neural ectoderm a process that occurs in concert with neural induction per se This        patterning appears to involve the interaction of various signaling factors including FGF        BMP WNT and retinoic acid all of which act as posteriorizing factors Kudoh et al         Suppression of BMP signaling by expression of its antagonists is the condition that        specifies the dorsal ectoderm or BCNE as future anterior neural ectoderm in contrast        posterior neural ectoderm may form under the influence of FGF even in the presence of BMP        signaling The work by Kuroda et al  thus shows that initial specification of        anterior neural ectoderm in         Xenopus  as in other vertebrates takes place before        gastrulation and does not require organizer signals this is not to say that full        differentiation and patterning of the nervous system could be achieved without organizer        participation                    Induction and Competence        The formation of the vertebrate nervous system thus depends on multiple signaling        pathways such as the FGF BMP and WNT signaling cascades that interact in complex ways        eg Pera et al  In contrast to the classical view neural induction is not        exclusively promoted by organizerderived signals in that earlier signals and intrinsic        processes that determine ectodermal competence are prominently involved Whether inductive        signals or competence of responding tissue is more important in embryology has been        debated much like the naturenurture controversy in the behavioral arena Current work has        given some boost to the competence side of the argument but as in behavior the truth        lies somewhere in between though not necessarily at the halfway mark Studies such as        those discussed here bring us closer to finding the answer to this question
