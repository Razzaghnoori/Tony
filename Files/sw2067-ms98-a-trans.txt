              well um with credit cards is me i uh i try to get maybe just one or two i dont i dont like having credit cards for every store i i uh i just dont like them   what are you afraid of with them   what am i afraid of um i dont know if im really afraid of spending too much i just uh dont think that i need them you know i uh   yes   they are tempting at times but i i just you know       sometimes i just dont like everybody knowing everything about me you know so   well thats very can be very very true   so and the you know everybody just gives you a credit card just so youll spend money so   well thats the idea they figure that if they give you a card at no charge for a whole year that you will use it and   yeah uhhuh thats right see they make money off of it whether you use it or not   absolutely well the other thing of course is the fact that they hope you will not pay your bill at the end of the month so that you will be paying interest   thats right uhhuh   i use mine a great deal um for groceries for everything that i can and then just write one check at the end of the month for the entire thing right   uhhuh thats what i do thats what i do just a second  Whitney i will im on the phone honey sorry   thats all right sounds like you have a little one there oh you have great how old are they   i have two little ones yeah yeah so that always want some um four and two and half   oh boy those are two very active age   yes so yeah um im im like you i i use my only use my credit card for um you know when i you know i just use it whenever i feel like i dont want to write a check and then but i dont charge anything that i cant payoff at the end of the month   uhhuh well uh do you uh do you ever use the ATM machines   so no i never do my husband does at work just to get cash out but uh i take the checkbook so i you know i just if i need cash i just tell him and he gets it out and i dont even think i know my number     well i find it a great use from the standpoint that you dont have to continue to write checks in order to get cash   uhhuh thats right see we he couldnt do without it he but you know since he can just do it right there at work for nothing   oh that helps right well the the other thing some people are not aware of is they will use their a their credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash   yeah uhhuh   and when they do that they begin paying interest right from that very day on   youre right and thats kind of silly   yeah right absolutely because they figure that  thats correct  the idea is to use their money   yeah your defeating the purpose   yeah     and uh during that whole month and then pay it at the end of the month   yeah yeah i mean i get i get at least one or two a week people to you know sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and i just say i dont want it because i   umhum right well i think thats the only thing you can do is just say no and mean no and not be tempted   yeah yeah its like id like to know where they determine that im such a good credit risk that they can go and say you get this much credit line you know youve already been preapproved   well it and oh absolutely preapproved thats their favorite word   yes everybody in the country is preapproved i think   i think so youre right well its interesting uh that uh people have the generally the same view of credit cards no matter where you go     so yeah uhhuh yeah and then some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find you know one day they find wow i didnt realize i had this much you know id spent this much money and then they cant meet the minimum monthly payments on it   that much spent right well and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own and i mean that does nothing but exacerbate the entire problem   uhhuh yeah it does because youre you know you youre you know youre just costing costing yourself more money because you if you cant make the monthly the minimum payment youre paying interest again so yeah   thats right thats right well its been enjoyable talking with you   yes its enjoyable talking with seeing that somebody feels the same way so well you you too good luck byebye      right well take good care take care of your little ones uhhuh byebye
