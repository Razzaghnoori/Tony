 well um with credit cards is me i uh i try to get maybe just one or two i don t i don t like having credit cards for every store i i uh i just don t like them what are you afraid of with them what am i afraid of um i don t know if i m really afraid of spending too much i just uh don t think that i need them you know i uh yes they are tempting at times but i i just you know sometimes i just don t like everybody knowing everything about me you know so well that s very can be very very true so and the you know everybody just gives you a credit card just so you ll spend money so well that s the idea they figure that if they give you a card at no charge for a whole year that you will use it and yeah uh huh that s right see they make money off of it whether you use it or not absolutely well the other thing of course is the fact that they hope you will not pay your bill at the end of the month so that you will be paying interest that s right uh huh i use mine a great deal um for groceries for everything that i can and then just write one check at the end of the month for the entire thing right uh huh that s what i do that s what i do just a second Whitney i will i m on the phone honey sorry that s all right sounds like you have a little one there oh you have great how old are they i have two little ones yeah yeah so that always want some um four and two and half oh boy those are two very active age yes so yeah um i m i m like you i i use my only use my credit card for um you know when i you know i just use it whenever i feel like i don t want to write a check and then but i don t charge anything that i can t payoff at the end of the month uh huh well uh do you uh do you ever use the ATM machines so no i never do my husband does at work just to get cash out but uh i take the checkbook so i you know i just if i need cash i just tell him and he gets it out and i don t even think i know my number well i find it a great use from the standpoint that you don t have to continue to write checks in order to get cash uh huh that s right see we he couldn t do without it he but you know since he can just do it right there at work for nothing oh that helps right well the the other thing some people are not aware of is they will use their a their credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash yeah uh huh and when they do that they begin paying interest right from that very day on you re right and that s kind of silly yeah right absolutely because they figure that that s correct the idea is to use their money yeah your defeating the purpose yeah and uh during that whole month and then pay it at the end of the month yeah yeah i mean i get i get at least one or two a week people to you know sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and i just say i don t want it because i um hum right well i think that s the only thing you can do is just say no and mean no and not be tempted yeah yeah it s like i d like to know where they determine that i m such a good credit risk that they can go and say you get this much credit line you know you ve already been preapproved well it and oh absolutely preapproved that s their favorite word yes everybody in the country is preapproved i think i think so you re right well it s interesting uh that uh people have the generally the same view of credit cards no matter where you go so yeah uh huh yeah and then some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find you know one day they find wow i didn t realize i had this much you know i d spent this much money and then they can t meet the minimum monthly payments on it that much spent right well and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own and i mean that does nothing but exacerbate the entire problem uh huh yeah it does because you re you know you you re you know you re just costing costing yourself more money because you if you can t make the monthly the minimum payment you re paying interest again so yeah that s right that s right well it s been enjoyable talking with you yes it s enjoyable talking with seeing that somebody feels the same way so well you you too good luck bye bye right well take good care take care of your little ones uh huh bye bye
