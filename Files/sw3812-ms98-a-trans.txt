                  so Cathy what do you do in the way of lawn and garden work   well we have Bermuda grass here do you have that there   um i dont know exactly what that is   its a kind of grass that dies in the winter time   um i dont   do you live in an apartment or a house   yeah i live in an apartment   so you probably dont do any lawn care     yeah thats thats actually correct   oh okay well we used to have a service come in and fertilize and such but we ran in some into some money trouble so we do all of that ourselves now does the grass die there in Iowa in the winter time is everything brown   um it turns brown yeah   yeah   guess it freezes and everything so   yeah so right now we do nothing because its brown and it doesnt grow until later on in the spring   so does that mean you have to replant each year or   but no huhuh it just goes dormant and then it starts its you know it rejuvenates itself in the springtime there are people that uh that reseed in the winter time and grow something called winter grass or something like that i cant remember exactly what its called and so its green in the winter but you have to seed over all of this other stuff thats there and its kind of hard to grow its kind of foolish  as far as im concerned   i see   so did you grow up in Iowa   no im actually from uh uh the Seattle area we lived outside  outside of the city in the country and uh we have five acres of land up against a hillside where i grew up and so we did have a garden about a one a half acre garden big size   oh yeah   and grew standard things like corn beans and we had some trees apple trees fruit trees you know and apple trees and   did your mom do any canning and that kind of stuff   oh yeah   huh   did lots of canning and we even made an annual trip out to eastern Washington Yakima area to get uh peaches and things like that to can in addition to the the fruit we got out of our own garden   huh huh we have a garden here but in Texas its really hard to grow a garden because its so hot  and the sun is so intense that you know the   uhhuh   the tomatoes come on and they kind of fry right on the plant so its real hard and the bugs you know if that doesnt kill it the bugs do so i have tried kind you know with just very little success to have a garden here did you enjoy it did you like to do it when you were there   oh yeah i enjoyed um working in the garden um my dad was a big um fan of organic gardening   huh   and so when we um did our garbage and stuff we separated all the banana peels and egg shells and stuff that   yeah you had a compost pile huh   yeah yeah and always picked a different place in the garden to dump it out had our own rototiller and rough even though it was a large plot we used a rototiller for the whole thing and so that was it was quite a bit of work for all of us but we five kids and   how many how many were in your family   uh six kids altogether   was it something that the kids mostly took care of   actually dad did more than his share but uh we always had our our assignments to help out   yeah yeah   so and mom did very little of the gardening although she did most of the canning and other things   yeah what was your favorite thing to eat   um oh to eat oh um the our big crops were were green beans and corn and i guess i liked the corn   uhhuh yeah   and so  now that im in Iowa i should be get be able to get lots of uh   youd think so   corn on the cob huh   so what took you to Iowa   uh i just graduated i im working at the University of Iowa   uhhuh   um on a post doctoral fellowship i just graduated out west with a PhD in physics   where did you graduate   uh Brigham Young University   i knew it  im a member too thats why i was  when you were talking about your garden and everything and your mom canning i thought this guys got to be  got to have roots there somewhere   uh uh   yes and uh so are you originally from Texas   no i grew up in California   i see did did your family have a farm or were you more in the city   no it was more in the city but we did have a um a little garden out in the back because anything grows there  you just stick it in the ground and it it grows   uhhuh oh yeah yeah my wife is from southern California and their family has a an orange tree and a lemon tree out back   yeah   and they grow a few things they tried tomatoes and stuff but not they dont have very you know just a small small backyard so theres not too much else they could do there   yeah do you have in in your apartment
