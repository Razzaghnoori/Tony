        you said youre are financial uh financial planner so do you work with individual um     yes   like companies or i mean   well we work with both we work with individuals and we work with companies and executives and um we do business and personal uh financial planning and budgeting and investing for those people   so how do you handle your own account   how do i handle my own account   your your own budget   uh well the first part of being of of a good budget or a good financial planner is to uh number one dont have any debt so yes being debt free is very important and keeping a budget uh below your income is important also   hm  right now i think really the only debt we have is our house and   oh thats great youre ahead of most of the people out there then   well good  but we really dont have a monthly budget that we live on but we dont spend       um frivolously either   uhhuh   uh i mean we dont i dont we dont have anything on the computer that says oops we only have five dollars left to spend this week you know its not that rigid um   well a budget does not have to be rigid   hm um i know though im expecting and um were thinking about cutting down to one salary  and so when it comes down to that that is going to be quite a change in our income because i not quite fifty percent but maybe forty percent of our income is based on mine um   sure   so i think when  when it comes to that time period we are going to need to watch our our funds a little bit more um right now were struggling with it oh the thing is that both our cars are paid off but they are the same age and his my husbands car is American mines Japanese but his is breaking down a lot more you know i havent had any problems and were were   umhum   uh trying to decide well do we go ahead and get another car or do we just drive this one till it breaks you know and if we do what kind of car do we want to get and if we do do we should we pay cash for it or uh try to get a low interest   right   you you know interest rate     well uh one thing that really uh helps i find in budgeting and personally in budget as well as a business budget is prior planning prevents poor results and uh lot of people uh have not even considered that maybe that a car payment a monthly car payment that they put it in every month whether they have a car payment or not       and therefore they would save up enough money over a couple year period to replace a vehicle when they needed it   we both have done that um we both work at companies that have credit unions   uhhuh   so we had direct deposit you know for our car payment anyway and when my car was paid off i never told them to you know to stop taking that money out so theyve still been putting in oh i dont remember how much my payments were two hundred and fifty three hundred dollars   well that is called smart budgeting   oh good  smart budgeting is that what you said or just smart     oh its real financial planning but were talking about budgeting so   um   that is very smart to do   and then my husband has done the same thing with his payments so its just more to us not necessarily setting up for another car but just going into savings   uhhuh   and i i think our thing right now is the way the interest rates are and uh well thats in our goals i guess for this year first quarter is to examine our financial standing you know and try to decide how we want to invest our money because right now the the uh interest rates on everything seems to be so low that you know i dont really see any benefit over um uh oh i cant remember what we compared it to but over putting your money in say a CD or market money account or something over just a regular savings there wasnt enough difference in the interest rate to make a different i mean  to uh i mean i guess our savings account is probably a lot more liquid than CDs or or um   right   money money markets i dont know what else there i know there are a bunch of different things you can invest in but   right   right now i dont know what do you think the way things are going right now that   well uh um with the economy the way it is its very important that um we dont spend capital we dont have to because we dont know when well need it   right   and secondly is is that we need to make our money work for us so we dont have to work harder   right   and uh it just takes time to do that and um if a person has capital resources uh or cash on hand to take care of emergencies
