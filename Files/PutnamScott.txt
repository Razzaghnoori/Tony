 Just talk Just talk OK um we um live in Matthews NC We are here from Dayton OH We ve been here about 13 years and we have two children Wes and Megan who uh one just finished college and one other one is uh Megan is a junior at Carolina this this fall Um we have enjoyed I guess our move here and the people we ve met and all just the differences I guess We kind of had some uh not reservation about moving it was an elective move for us but certainly um living in a different part of the country than we were used to was uh something which was a change for us and something that we had thought long about But coming here rather than um perhaps picking up and focusing on the differences I think we tried to look at the uh you know just the um the the special points about the uh life in the South and and the people here and the customs and I think it s been something that we ve always uh valued Some some folks uh either uh from the South don t value the people from the North and vice versa but I think it s been a real positive thing our move for us in many ways And uh it was a little harder on our children particularly uh Wes Um he was at a just uh had a real good group of kids or boys that he was friends with and did lots of things with And when he came here uh you know having to start all over for him was difficult And I think it took him a little while uh longer than our daughter who fit in I think with a group of people pretty quickly We ve been involved in the area in our neighborhood There s a neighborhood association we ve been involved in that pretty strongly We ve um we re members of Matthew s United Methodist Church and have been there for almost the 13 years that we ve been here and have had various um areas of participation and leadership there and have been pretty much a part of the community Um we have a fairly strong family Uh we have family in all parts of the country or at least this part of the United this part of the uh Eastern United States in VA and KY And just had a family member move here from KY three years ago And uh my wife s family is scattered uh back in OH and in FL and Denver CO But we find that a a fairly intentional way every year of getting together and we enjoy just uh doing some fairly mundane things But when we get together we um that is we just enjoy eating food we enjoy putting puzzles together we sometimes go to the beach and just do as little as we can as possible and just enjoy you know doing things together So we have a fairly um I would say strong family and important to us and are fairly intentional about getting together as often as we can Um What are some of the differences you noticed when coming down here from that you mentioned Differences well it s uh I think there s you know just different uh phrases and different ways of saying things I think that uh it will take a while for me to get used to mashing a button on an elevator or or um I m just trying to think of instead of taking someone home that you would carry them home or carry them to the store We picked up pretty easily the um phrase for you know Hello or a greeting is Hey And usually that was something you said up north to get someone s attention Like Hey you or Hey Over there But here it s just a greeting and we ve gone back to visit in OH or elsewhere and we pretty much it s just become a part of our language or usage as well and um you know people ask us about it But we ve picked up some things and then certainly there are other things that language wise we um still find uh a little different to get used to Uh I think that I don t know I guess in terms of pace of life I don t know that it s a lot different from what we were used to I think that maybe in the northeast you would find maybe things to be more hectic or people to be perhaps less friendly but I think it pretty much depends on who you are and where you are and the kind of person you are as as to whether or not you you know make friends easily or whether you know you actually put people off To my mind that doesn t really matter what part of the country you are from It seems if you re used to if you re if it s in your nature you know to treat people with respect that you don t have that you know problem fitting in Uh but if you try to emphasize I guess differences then I think then that s probably another issue One thing that was kind of interesting too was that we uh you know just some strange things about Charlotte in fact is that when we came here well we re back in OH I mean there s a fairly uh developed very well developed library system And there I mean just good libraries and large libraries in neighborhoods and certainly the downtown area When we came here they were just finishing the new main library in uptown Charlotte but still there were uh libraries in storefronts on Independence Blvd There was a small library over on Sharon Rd or actually on Fairview Rd it was the Sharon Library and a very small one in Matthews and and the rest were just hither and yon And now we have one of the I guess well recognized library systems and probably the better ones in the United States We have regional libraries that have just seemed to have grown up in both the University area and Rea Rd and uh South Park and other places And it s just amazing how much change there s been a a dramatic change there has been just in that one institution alone Um and you look at other kinds of things and I think Charlotte and maybe it s typical of the South but I think that uh maybe there hasn t been as much growth here before and when you have growth and you have people coming in who looking for services And you and you also have a a government um who are are really ready to take that challenge as opposed to just deciding that Hey listen we re gonna do things the way we ve done it for the last you know 100 years whether new people come or need services or ask for amenities or not we re going to keep things the way they are In fact the town of Matthews I think um at least my understanding is is that when Providence Plantation uh reached a certain point in population they they wanted to be annexed to the town of Matthews because they thought maybe that the city of Charlotte would annex them and so they wanted to that they petitioned the town of Matthews to annex But the town of Matthews at that point said No because they were afraid that all these people from other places would come in and be a part of the town government and change things And so they decided to you know basically vote the outsiders out and it will keep the town uh small But Matthews has grown many times uh just in the last 15 years And and and certainly the the leadership has changed there And uh you know there is a more inclusive uh government there Um other differences uh I think we we miss a park system a little better organized park system We were used to um probably some smaller parks and and and larger parks regional parks and state parks But we would often go to to hike and actually they had cabins and things like that other activities and with them that we did Um but people wise I think we ve we ve found people to be probably pretty much the what you hear about in the South And that is the Southern house hospitality and the people are for the most part warm and friendly and um and and that s been a just a a really a nice nice part about moving here I think that I it just depends on what the accent is but I could sit and listen for hours to to certain southern accents I enjoy listening uh to people who have grown up in the area and who speak with that accent It used to be when you could come here that uh that still the people who were native to Charlotte or to the South were the greatest number of the population And now it seems like at least in the place where I work and other people we run into a lot of people uh seem to be from other places and fewer people you know are just native to uh to the Carolinas or um to the South Um just trying to think of other things that might be difference Well I guess I work for the city of Charlotte and I m probably partial uh to to governments but I worked for the City of Dayton before and also with a regional agency in Cleveland And I think that um that in terms of at least Charlotte if the if the city government is is is at all representative of of just the politics here both in the private sector and the public sector there s just a real interest in in uh in in getting things done And and also I think not necessarily in reinventing the wheel but in looking at everything that you do to see if there s some way that you can t do it better And to reengineer processes to uh to try to again be you know I guess good stewards of the public s money and to and to act in a in a very reasonable and responsible way and to provide basic good basic services And I think that whether we re talking about um you know that or we re talking about a can do spirit to do other civic projects public projects partnering with the private sector I think that there is just a real attitude to again be a place of excellence and to find a way to get things done And that s been uh something which I haven t in in other places And I think Charlotte is is recognized as not only as a it s a business community and a growth community but also as a community that has one of the best um governments uh in the nation for for at least populations cities our size I think we re nationally recognized uh for what we do from just a managing standpoint Um and so that s been a I think a good change for us uh since I work in that environment One thing is it s been difficult trying to now now that my family starting to move down here I think that the one drawback was uh just moving probably eight hours away driving time from um from Dayton But now most of our family is in other places and so that s probably not as much of a factor So I guess one question might be how I met my wife Um I guess that s a I ve known my wife for a long time Uh we grew up in the same uh city together We went to different high schools but we went to the same church And our families were friends for many years and so we were acquainted that way but it wasn t until I was probably a sophomore in college that uh we started dating And um she went to Miami University in OH and I went to Purdue in IN so visiting was uh problematic but we we did find a way every couple of weeks to um to get together And I guess that started in probably 71 and we were married in June of 73 So Susan still had uh a semester or two to finish I was in graduate school and then we I graduated and we went to moved to Cleveland she finished up Even though she went to Miami for two years Purdue for two years she still had some classes to make up and so she went to Cleveland State and to Baldwin Wallace in Cleveland and finally graduated with a with a degree from Purdue Um she had lost some credits in transferring But we had a it was a good way to to start out in life We uh lived in married student housing we we had a fairly uh tight budget Um you know I had an assistantship with with the university so we were pretty much sufficient on that But we learned uh to uh to do with uh very little and to um just enjoy you know getting to I mean being together and and knowing each other and finding neat things to do And so I think that we ve we ve pretty much carried that through uh the rest of our life in many ways I think we enjoy you know being together we enjoy um you know talking clears throat and doing some of the simple things If we have other things that s great and we we seek those out but we re not I mean we re not we enjoy spending time together and don t necessarily seek time apart And we ve been doing this now for about 28 years so it s been a a good marriage for us
