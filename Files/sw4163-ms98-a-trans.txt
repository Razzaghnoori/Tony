                it seems to me that the the benefits of working for a big company tend to be the the same things that that are to their determent um they arent as as responsive both to like bad economic times you dont have to worry about your job all of a sudden disappearing   yeah   but when you see a job when you see a a job that needs to be done sometimes you have to fill out the five forms in triplicate in order to to get it done you know what i mean   yeah yeah see i work for a really small company its just me and my boss   oh wow   so its really small and i think its really nice because you know its its real easy we dont really have much to do but its just me and him so if he needs something done i do it or you know it just goes straight from me to him and we dont have to go through a bunch of people like youre saying but   right   but sometimes its kind of bad because if im sick then i kind of i usually have to go in unless im you know have to stay in bed because im the only one there yeah   there is that i mean well and then i guess again i i guess like i said when i when i started off that the advantages tend to be the same things that the disadvantages i mean if i dont show up for for work theres probably somebody else that could fill my spot but   yeah   um i imagine and and thats nice but uh its would its also nice to be able to uh   yeah   know that that you are the person that that makes things get done you know if if youre not there it doesnt happen   yeah yeah and also also in big companies they have uh like vacations and all no if i take a vacation ive got to get a friend or someone else to come in for a temporary to come in for a week   yeah oh wow oh wow   yeah so  so its pretty nice being able to take off and have someone else take your take up your time and all   umhum   so   you know one other benefit that that just occurred to me i didnt take it as much advantage of it at least not yet in  sometimes big companies will pay for like education   oh yeah yeah   i had some friends of mine uh get sent up to Stanford for a year for uh college or for like for grad school and i guess getting stuck in California for the summer is is not such a bad thing   yeah yeah   you know but uh   a friend of mine works for a a stockbroker and um its a really its a big company and they said that um   uhhuh   as a after she works there a year as long as she takes business courses theyll reimburse her   uhhuh   so thats pretty nice so that she could move up in the company   yeah   and thats pretty nice my job wont do that           yeah yeah but i would think that a a smaller company you would have a i mean if if if a small company hits some niche in the some niche market that that it is uniquely qualified to um take care of it has a chance to to grow really fast   yeah   and if you can get on top of it before before it goes up i mean you know if all of a sudden the company expanded to like you know three thousand people you would probably be one of the top people   yeah   of course i guess if theres only the two of you youll i mean i guess youre youre one of the top two people but you are also in the bottom half so   yeah   so uh um the only other thing i can think of is uh uh stuff for things like uh like if if theres some kind of child care if if someone were married and had kids   yeah thats   bigger companies might have something like that   yeah that would be nice   and uh um  like like its their i guess another advantage might be that uh if they if its big a big enough company and it has multiple sites   yeah   um if you wanted to you could stay with the same company and decide you wanted to live in another part of the country   yeah they moved uh my dad worked for im not even sure where but they moved us from Dallas to San Antonio and then back to Dallas       so we kind of got moved around but it was pretty nice because you know we lived in San Antonio for a while and all i mean i guess its nice if you have family that lives somewhere else and you want to be next be near them you can see it switch through the company to over at that state or whatever   which i guess i being with a small company you wouldnt get forced to move but do you think uh do you think it was good to to move around or not   yeah i do i mean i think it kind of helped us because you know we werent just living in Dallas and didnt exactly know just everything about Dallas and you know i mean i doubt seriously that if we had stayed here that i would have been able to move to to get to San Antonio very much so   oh you had family in San Antonio   no we had family in Dallas and we moved to San Antonio and we were kind of like everybody else is in Oklahoma and Louisiana   oh okay   so but i guess it was pretty nice because you know we got to experience living down there somewhere different   see im trying to decide my dad was in the military which is i guess if you figure companies the military would be a pretty big company   yeah   a number of people but uh although its getting smaller every every day um and we moved like oh man we used to move like every every three years at least   yeah   and like i dont know i mean theres well theres i ive kept in touch with some people from college but but i dont i mean i dont really know i cant i wouldnt i couldnt
