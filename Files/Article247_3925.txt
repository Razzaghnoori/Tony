 Hong Kong and the Limits of E Commerce Air travel is a horror But still how amazing I mean to get on a plane at 10 p m in New York on a Thursday night and 22 hours later hop off in Hong Kong where it s 6 a m on Saturday morning I m sorry call me Amish but how cool is that I ve been thinking a lot about our trip and the amazing Place of the Future that is Hong Kong The thing that I think will totally mess up businesspeople when they consider Hong Kong and to a different degree the rest of China is the extent to which e commerce and the Net will catch on It s the classic fool s trap that every businessperson from Marco Polo on has made when considering the gigantic potential market of China Again it s easy to leap to the wrong conclusions when you wander around Hong Kong and see how wired everyone is So many cell phones Groups of people out on the town and rather than talking to each other each was engaged in a cell phone conversation with someone else It seemed like we were never more than 10 paces away from a street side stall selling cell phones service or accouterments I ve never seen such customizing of digitalia It made me want to buy one since you made me get rid of our old useless one just so I could personalize it with one of those translucent antennas with the lightning bolt inside People customize their phones in Hong Kong the way bus drivers personalize their vehicles in Mexico Fringe medallions blinking lights Remember the teen age girls talking into phones that were buried inside Winnie the Pooh covers Now imagine when all those cell phoners start browsing the Web through their smart phones Shopping is the culture of Hong Kong and add the Net to it you figure and you ve got a trillion dollar opportunity but you d be wrong The thing about shopping here is it s a social activity a reason to get out of your tiny apartment Didn t we hear that HK is the most crowded place on the planet That s why e commerce will never catch on It provides a solution to a nonexistent problem People want to leave their desks and their apartments indeed they have to if they want to see each other The Net will never catch on there the way it has here
