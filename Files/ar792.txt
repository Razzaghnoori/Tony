 Introduction In diarthodial joints cartilage provides a smooth surface that enables joints to articulate and to withstand compressional and shear stress 1 Embedded in the cartilage are chondrocytes that respond to biochemical and physical stimuli to maintain this tissue Cartilage is primarily composed of type II collagen and proteoglycan which are synthesized by the chondrocytes In addition chondrocytes produce enzymes such as the matrix metalloproteinases MMPs that degrade the cartilage 2 In arthritis an imbalance of these processes in favour of degradation results in a loss of cartilage For the patient this is manifested as a degeneration of joint function loss of mobility and concomitant increased morbidity and mortality 3 4 For the clinician this imbalance identifies a need for therapeutic agents to prevent cartilage loss 5 In identifying targets for therapeutic intervention it is important to note that the loss of collagen rather than proteoglycan is correlated with disease severity 6 Furthermore whereas lost proteoglycan is replaced rapidly degraded collagen is resynthesized very slowly 7 8 Consequently understanding collagen degradation and providing therapeutics to prevent it are valuable aims Within the MMP family MMP 1 collagenase 1 and MMP 13 collagenase 3 are expressed in arthritic joints and efficiently degrade type II collagen 9 MMP 13 is more effective than MMP 1 in cleaving type II collagen but it is debated which is the principal collagenase in vivo 10 11 These enzymes have been implicated in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis RA and osteoarthritis OA and have long been therapeutic targets 12 Historically inhibition of MMP active sites has been a strategy however with wide ranging side effects and lack of efficacy these studies are proving unfruitful in providing an effective drug 13 Although the etiologies and pathologies of RA and OA differ it is clear that in both of these diseases pro inflammatory cytokines are present resulting in an inflammatory state as well as cartilage degradation 14 As further evidence for the role of pro inflammatory cytokines in RA anti tumor necrosis factor anti TNF and anti interleukin 1 anti IL 1 therapies can reduce inflammation and retard the progression of disease as assessed radiographically 15 16 However side effects with these approaches such as the development of lymphomas in patients using anti TNF therapies demonstrate that alternative therapies are needed 17 An alternative approach to the prevention of cartilage degradation is the inhibition of MMPs by targeting either the expression of their genes or the synthesis of the proteins Triterpenoids are a novel family of steroid like compounds with weak anti inflammatory properties 18 Synthetic triterpenoids have been produced with the aim of achieving increased potency 19 20 2 Cyano 3 12 dioxoolean 1 9 dien 28 oic acid CDDO is a synthetic triterpenoid that has been shown to inhibit expression of the inflammatory genes inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclo oxygenase 2 20 21 22 In a recent report MMP 1 and MMP 13 expression were induced with IL 1 a known pro inflammatory mediator in vivo in joint tissues 23 It was shown that CDDO could inhibit the IL 1 induced expression of these pro inflammatory MMPs These findings make CDDO an attractive molecule to study as a potential anti arthritic agent Here we report quantification of the effects of CDDO on gene expression in the human chondrosarcoma cell line SW 1353 with the use of real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RT PCR To ensure that the chondroprotective effects of CDDO are not limited to this cell line we studied its effects on human primary chondrocytes We found that at concentrations that do not induce apoptosis CDDO effectively inhibits the induction of both MMP 1 and MMP 13 gene expression by IL 1 in these cells Whereas the inhibition of MMP 1 by CDDO requires pretreatment inhibition of MMP 13 does not We have recently reported the role of the inhibitor of NF B I B family member Bcl 3 in IL 1 induced MMP 1 expression 24 Here we show that overexpression of Bcl 3 can partly abrogate CDDO s inhibitory effects on MMP 1 in SW 1353 cells suggesting that Bcl 3 might be a target for CDDO Materials and methods Materials cells and cell culture CDDO was kindly provided by Dr Tadashi Honda and Dr Gordon Gribble Dartmouth College Hanover NH USA Human SW 1353 chondrosarcoma cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection Rockville MD USA Stable SW 1353 cell lines carrying a pBkRSV vector with a Bcl 3 expression insert were created as described previously 24 Freshly excised macroscopically normal cartilage and synovium from OA patients undergoing knee replacement surgery were obtained from a local orthopedic unit Dartmouth Hitchcock Memorial Hospital Lebanon NH USA These tissues constitute waste from the operations Under our current protocol with the Committee for Human Subjects as mandated by HIPPA we did not collect subject information We therefore made no selection on the basis of age or sex Cartilage and synovium were degraded in 4 mg ml collagenase Sigma St Louis MO USA for 16 hours at 37 C with shaking at 90 r p m and cells were cultured to one passage chondrocytes or four passages synovial fibroblasts SW 1353 cells normal or stably transfected with pBkRSV Bcl 3 human primary chondrocytes or synovial fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium DMEM supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum Hyclone Logan UT USA penicillin streptomycin and L glutamine Cellgro Mediatech Herndon VA USA before use in experiments Assay of CDDO s effects on chondrocytes and fibroblasts At the beginning of each experiment chondrocytes or OA synovial fibroblasts were washed three times with Hanks balanced salt solution Cellgro to remove traces of serum and placed in DMEM containing 0 2 lactalbumin hydrolysate Invitrogen Carlsbad CA USA Cells were cultured for 24 hours with CDDO as a pretreatment or CDDO was added at the same time as 10 ng ml recombinant IL 1 at time 0 Promega Madison WI USA After a further 18 hours of culture with IL 1 total RNA was harvested with TRIzol Invitrogen and assayed for MMP 1 MMP 13 and Bcl 3 expression by using quantitative real time RT PCR Glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH was assayed to normalize data Reverse transcription and quantitative real time PCR methods were as described previously 24 MMP 13 primers used were as follows upper 5 TGGCATTGCTGACATCATGA 3 lower 3 GCCAGAGGGCCCATCAA 5 The product size was 76 base pairs A plasmid containing MMP 13 cDNA provided by Dr Carlos Lopez Otin Oviedo Spain was used to generate an MMP 13 standard curve Primers and standards for MMP 1 Bcl 3 and GAPDH were as described previously 24 The generation and use of standard curves were as described previously 24 Measurement of programmed cell death by staining with Hoechst 33342 SW 1353 and human primary chondrocytes were seeded at 5 10 4cells per well in 24 well plates Becton Dickinson Franklin Lakes NJ USA At 60 90 confluence cells were treated with CDDO 10 nM to 10 M for 24 hours followed by IL 1 for 18 hours Hoechst 33342 Sigma 1 g ml was then added to each well to detect cells with condensed chromatin a hallmark of programmed cell death After 30 minutes of incubation at 37 C cells were examined under a fluorescent microscope as described previously 24 Statistical analysis Analyses of real time PCR data were performed with unpaired two tailed Student s t tests on triplicate wells cultured simultaneously Results Effects of CDDO in SW 1353 cells Previous work suggested that preincubation with CDDO was required for the effective inhibition of IL 1 induced MMP gene expression in SW 1353 cells 23 To quantify the effect of altering the period of CDDO preincubation 300 nM CDDO was added to SW 1353 cells simultaneously with IL 1 or 24 hours before treatment with the cytokine We found that SW 1353 cells expressed very low basal levels of MMP 1 and MMP 13 and that these were not significantly affected by incubation with CDDO Fig 1 IL 1 induced the expression of MMP 1 and MMP 13 and these were significantly inhibited when the cultures were pretreated with CDDO for 24 hours the respective decreases being 55 for MMP 1 P 0 1 and 66 for MMP 13 P 0 01 In addition when added simultaneously with the cytokine CDDO significantly inhibited the IL 1 induced expression of MMP 13 but not that of MMP 1 Under these circumstances MMP 13 expression was decreased by 41 P 0 05 The different profiles for MMP 1 and MMP 13 inhibition when CDDO was added simultaneously with the cytokine suggest a difference in the action of the inhibitor on the expression of each enzyme Previously with the use of Northern blotting dose response assays in SW 1353 cells showed that 300 nM was the lowest dose of CDDO sufficient to decrease the IL 1 induced expression of MMP 1 and MMP 13 23 This was confirmed by using quantitative real time PCR Doses below 300 nM did not decrease MMP expression whereas those above 1 M resulted in poor RNA harvests and low expression of the MMPs data not shown This effect at higher doses might be due to the reported apoptotic effects of CDDO 25 26 To examine for such effects SW 1353 cells were treated for 24 hours with CDDO under serum free conditions and then IL 1 was added for a further 18 hours Cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 and examined under a fluorescent microscope Doses of 300 nM and 1 M CDDO with or without IL 1 did not increase apoptosis compared with control medium alone or IL 1 data not shown However a dose of 5 M caused apoptosis in SW 1353 cells as seen in lower cell numbers changed morphology and an increased number of fluorescing cells These data demonstrate that at 300 nM and 1 M doses that inhibit MMP gene expression CDDO does not cause programmed cell death CDDO time course in human primary chondrocytes As described in the Introduction the aim of studying the triterpenoids is to develop a therapeutic agent for the treatment of arthritis We were therefore interested in studying the effects of CDDO in human primary cells Quantitative real time RT PCR revealed that human chondrocytes expressed low levels of MMP 1 and MMP 13 in the absence of IL 1 and increased levels with addition of the cytokine Figs 2a 2b Pretreatment of cultures with 300 nM CDDO for 24 hours resulted in a decreased expression of IL 1 induced MMP 1 and MMP 13 MMP 1 expression was decreased by 99 P 0 01 and MMP 13 by 96 P 0 01 As was observed with SW 1353 cells MMP 13 expression was significantly decreased when CDDO was added simultaneously with the cytokine we observed a decrease of 67 P 0 1 MMP 1 expression was not significantly inhibited by CDDO added simultaneously with IL 1 Effects of CDDO on expression of Bcl 3 in human primary chondrocytes In the same time course experiment we assayed for the presence of Bcl 3 an I B family member that we have previously shown to have a role in MMP 1 expression We found that Bcl 3 was inducible with IL 1 in human primary chondrocytes and that CDDO significantly inhibited this expression Fig 2c In a similar manner to MMP 1 inhibition the decreased expression was observed only after preincubation of the cells with CDDO for 24 hours Figs 2a 2c This was in contrast to MMP 13 whose inhibition was possible without pretreatment with CDDO Fig 2b These results present further evidence of a link in MMP 1 and Bcl 3 expression and indicate that both molecules are similarly affected by CDDO CDDO dose response study in human primary chondrocytes To examine the effects of increasing doses of CDDO in human primary chondrocytes cells were preincubated for 24 hours with CDDO 300 nM to 5 M or with medium alone before the addition of IL 1 for 18 hours Figure 3shows that human primary chondrocytes have low basal expression of MMP 1 MMP 13 and Bcl 3 and that they are increased in the presence of IL 1 Increasing doses of CDDO resulted in a decreased expression of each gene For example MMP 1 expression was inhibited by 36 P 0 1 with 300 nM CDDO by 49 P 0 01 with 1 M CDDO and by 83 P 0 01 by 5 M CDDO Similar patterns emerged for MMP 13 63 81 and 99 and Bcl 3 33 61 and 86 in response to the respective doses of CDDO all results being significant Using Hoechst 33342 we assayed for potential toxicity of CDDO in human primary chondrocytes we found decreased cell numbers and increased apoptosis at or above 5 M CDDO data not shown Lower concentrations did not result in apoptosis Inhibition of MMP 1 MMP 13 and Bcl 3 in OA synovial fibroblasts In parallel with the study on human primary chondrocytes we examined the effects of 300 nM CDDO on synovial fibroblasts excised from OA synovium There were low basal expressions of MMP 1 MMP 13 and Bcl 3 which were increased in the presence of IL 1 and inhibited by CDDO following the trends observed in SW 1353 and human primary chondrocytes data not shown Effect of overexpression of Bcl 3 on the inhibition of MMP 1 by CDDO To examine further the role of Bcl 3 in IL 1 induced MMP 1 and MMP 13 expression we used SW 1353 cells stably transfected with a Bcl 3 expression construct These cells were pretreated with 300 nM CDDO for 24 hours and then cultured with IL 1 for 18 hours In the presence of empty vector IL 1 induced both MMP 1 and MMP 13 and their expression was decreased by CDDO by 48 and 46 respectively Fig 4 In cells stably transfected with the Bcl 3 expression plasmid IL 1 induced MMP 1 expression to levels 3 4 fold higher than in the cells transfected with empty vector Fig 4a In comparison MMP 13 expression was not significantly altered by the overexpression of Bcl 3 Fig 4b Furthermore the presence of exogenous Bcl 3 sustained MMP 1 expression in the presence of CDDO in comparison with cells expressing empty vector When cultured in the presence of IL 1 and CDDO cells transfected with Bcl 3 expressed 3 6 fold more MMP 1 than did cells transfected with the empty vector Fig 4a In contrast Bcl 3 did not sustain MMP 13 expression in CDDO treated cells Fig 4b Thus Bcl 3 which is repressed by CDDO preferentially contributes to MMP 1 gene expression Discussion In a previous study Northern blot analysis showed that treating SW 1353 cells with 300 nM CDDO for 24 hours before treatment with IL 1 inhibited the expression of MMP 1 and MMP 13 23 In the present study we used quantitative real time RT PCR to examine the action of CDDO on the expression of MMP 1 and MMP 13 in SW 1353 cells and in two primary cultures human primary chondrocytes and OA synovial fibroblasts We have shown in a quantitative manner that in all three cell types MMP 1 and MMP 13 are inducible with IL 1 and that CDDO inhibits the expression of these collagenases with optimal inhibition being observed after 24 hours of pretreatment with CDDO Differing effects were found on the two enzymes MMP 13 was inhibited more than MMP 1 In addition significant inhibition of MMP 13 did not require the pretreatment of cells with CDDO In addition the observation that synovial fibroblasts respond to CDDO in a similar manner to chondrocytes suggests that the inhibitor can act in all cells of the joint to decrease the expression of MMP 1 and MMP 13 In the human primary chondrocytes and OA synovial fibroblasts we assayed for CDDO s effects on Bcl 3 expression We have recently described the role of Bcl 3 an I B family member in the signaling pathways of IL 1 leading to MMP 1 expression in SW 1353 cells and rabbit synovial fibroblasts 24 We found that IL 1 could induce the expression of Bcl 3 and that Bcl 3 had a direct effect on MMP 1 expression through cooperation with NF B1 p50 In the present study we found that Bcl 3 expression was inducible by IL 1 in human primary chondrocytes and in OA synovial fibroblasts In addition we found that pretreatment with CDDO decreased the IL 1 induced expression of Bcl 3 in these cells Furthermore with the use of SW 1353 cells stably transfected with a Bcl 3 expression plasmid Bcl 3 could sustain the expression of MMP 1 but not that of MMP 13 against inhibition by CDDO These data show that Bcl 3 gene expression is a target of CDDO in chondrocytes and suggest that this might contribute to decreased MMP 1 expression Consistent with this model is the finding that pretreatment with CDDO for 24 hours is required for the inhibition of MMP 1 unlike that for MMP 13 We speculate that during this period the inhibitor is entering the cell and altering the expression of components of the IL 1 signalling pathway Bcl 3 is decreased by CDDO during this preincubation period and it might be one of several proteins involved in MMP expression whose own expression is lowered by CDDO In all cell types CDDO inhibited the IL 1 induced expression of MMP 13 mRNA more effectively than that of MMP 1 This might be due to the much lower MMP 13 expression in all tissues examined There is disagreement over which collagenase predominates in cartilage degradation in vivo 10 11 It is therefore of interest to find the levels of MMP 1 expressed compared with that of MMP 13 in SW 1353 and human primary chondrocytes For example in human primary chondrocytes Figs 3a 3b IL 1 induced MMP 1 to 14 molecules per molecule of GAPDH whereas MMP 13 was expressed at 0 06 molecules per molecule of GAPDH a more than 200 fold difference These results suggest that MMP 1 expression might be a dominant target for IL 1 in chondrocytes It is interesting to note that there was significant variation of both MMP 1 and MMP 13 expression in the primary human chondrocyte experiments In excising chondrocytes from the extracted knees of OA patients great care was taken to remove only tissue that seemed macroscopically normal with the aim of excluding cells of diseased tissue When these cells were cultured with medium alone they expressed low levels of MMP 1 and MMP 13 similar to those found in unstimulated SW 1353 cells These results support the contention that the cells were in a basal state unaffected by the environment of the diseased knee from which they had been extracted Furthermore both enzymes were consistently increased by IL 1 and inhibited by CDDO Thus the observed variation of MMP expression is probably due to genetic variability and not to experimental artifacts Naturally occurring triterpenoids such as ursolic acid have been found to have mild anti inflammatory effects 18 27 These have been improved with the development of synthetic triterpenoids such as CDDO offering a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of arthritis and other diseases 19 20 21 Furthermore it has been reported that CDDO at high doses 5 10 M can have pro apoptotic effects ideal for the treatment of leukemia but of concern with regard to chondrocyte cell death 25 26 However we found that CDDO at concentrations that decrease MMP 1 and MMP 13 expression namely 300 nM and 1 M did not cause cell death The inhibitory effect of CDDO on MMP 1 and MMP 13 expression as well as that of Bcl 3 is very encouraging for future applications of triterpenoids in arthritic disease CDDO is an early generation synthetic triterpenoid and further modifications continue to be made Further analysis of these compounds will provide additional information about their mechanisms and potential as therapeutic agents Conclusion Inhibition of collagen loss is crucial to minimizing cartilage destruction in the arthritides MMP 1 and MMP 13 have been identified as the significant enzymes involved in this process in vivo We examined a novel synthetic triterpenoid CDDO as a potential inhibitor of collagenase expression We found that CDDO inhibited the expression of these enzymes in a chondrocyte cell line human primary chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts Furthermore CDDO decreased the expression of the pro inflammatory mediator Bcl 3 suggesting one possible mechanism of action CDDO is an early generation therapeutic agent with great potential for the treatment of the arthritides and other inflammatory diseases Competing interests None declared Abbreviations CDDO 2 cyano 3 12 dioxoolean 1 9 dien 28 oic acid DMEM Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium GAPDH
