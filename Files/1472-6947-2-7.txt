                    Background        Indeed between the health care that we now have and        the health care we could have lies not just a gap but a        chasm Crossing the Quality Chasm A New Health System for        the  stCentury            When the Institute of Medicine recently assessed the        current state of affairs in US health care they found it        to be substantially lacking in key areas     The        reports authors identified a multitude of quality issues        to be addressed complex care is typically uncoordinated        information is often not available to those who need it        when it is needed and as a result patients often do not        get care they need or alternatively do get care they do        not need A common theme underlying many of these quality        issues has been underinvestment in information technology        in healthcare                    Discussion                  Information technology in healthcare today          Payment issues rather than clinical needs have          driven most investment in IT in healthcare Thus billing          systems are generally much better than the clinical          systems Furthermore while the exact figure varies          depending upon the survey healthcare has invested at          least  less of its gross revenues in information          technology than other informationintensive industries          like banking       Furthermore while banking has          international standards for exchange of data medicine          does not As a result one can go to an automated teller          in Tokyo or Moscow and withdraw money with a card but          going to a healthcare provider in one of these locations          with a serious medical issue would be a rather different          experience          In other industries companies have used excellent          information technology as a competitive edge For          example American Airlines derived substantial benefit          from its SABRE system which made it easy to determine          which flights were available and to make reservations              Similarly Federal Express with its tracking system          has an enviably high level of reliability which          customers have perceived as extremely valuable                       Few similar examples exist in healthcare today While          a few organizations have what are perceived as          bestofbreed information systems LDS Hospital and          Intermountain Health Care in Salt Lake City Wishard          Memorial Hospital and its affiliated clinics in          Indianapolis and Brigham and Womens Hospital and          Partners HealthCare System in Boston MA      the          reliability of these systems is nothing like that offered          by the systems of companies outside of healthcare for          example Federal Express     These organizations all          have had good financial performance which has given them          an edge in their local markets though their goal has not          been to spread In addition all their information          systems were homegrown and disseminating them has          proved difficult even to small hospitals within their own          networks An exception has been the Veterans          Administration information system which is an important          model of integration Information technology that results          in better clinical quality has not played the same role          it does in other industries for several reasons One is          that feeforservice reimbursement did not reward          efficiency Another is that care delivery is so granular          much of it is delivered by notforprofit organizations          and there are not just a few dominant players as in other          industries Finally in this unusual market the          healthcare IT vendors have had strong incentives to          retain their customer base and avoid          interoperability          Nonetheless excellent IT and highquality health care          are closely linked All of the healthcare organizations          mentioned above are recognized as quality leaders due to          excellent clinical outcomes which have been achieved in          part because of their information systems Furthermore          the organizations information systems have several          common threads all provide nearimmediate access to a          wide array of information including nearly all clinical          results they are highly integrated they provide          clinical decision support they have both inpatient and          outpatient data with differing views for each and they          facilitate measurement          Building the pyramid of clinical information systems          begins with a master patient index and results retrieval          These building blocks are necessary before higher level          applications are introduced One especially important          higherlevel application is computerized physician order          entry in which providers write orders including          prescriptions using computers     Computerization of          ordering is important because most actions in health care          follow an order computerizing this process allows          provision of realtime decision support to providers for          example implementation of guidelines and critical          pathways Another application that is extremely important          for delivering decision support is a program called an          event monitor which sits over a database and can provide          notification when an important event is found for          example a markedly elevated serum sodium level              Even more challenging than computerizing ordering or          building an event monitor especially in the inpatient          setting is computerizing the medical record especially          capturing of notes in real time Outpatient electronic          medical records in contrast are relatively easier to          implement and many examples of welldeveloped outpatient          records exist     Many benefits can be realized with          the addition of each of these building blocks          Unfortunately the industry norm in US clinical          information systems includes only the base of the          pyramid if that While most hospitals now do have both a          master patient index and results retrieval available for          some tests for individual patients who had tests done at          a specific institution views across institutions are          rare and many results are not incorporated Building a          master patient index is challenging in the US because          of the absence of a unique identifier and building and          maintaining such an index is laborious Many lab tests          are performed at outside laboratories and because of          this lack of integration such results are generally          unavailable via the information system as may be the          case with unusual tests like electroencephalograms While          images of a variety of types including radiographs and          electrocardiograms can now readily be displayed             such images are typically not yet accessible to          providers          More important most hospital systems provide little          or no clinical decision support to providers Clinical          decision support takes many forms  including passive          display of information such as the last digoxin level and          potassium in a patient receiving digoxin reminders  for          example that a mammogram is due alerts  that the          hematocrit is falling rapidly or that the patient has an          allergy to the prescribed drug and guidelines           suggestions about orders in a patient with a suspected          myocardial infarction Asking providers to deliver          todays complex care without such assistance is like          asking a commercial pilot to fly with no instruments          given the vast array of information and knowledge that          providers must handle One reason that such clinical          decision support is infrequently delivered is that          todays subsystems  for example the laboratory and          pharmacy systems  do not have good interfaces and thus          cannot readily communicate with each other This lack of          communication makes extracting important information and          providing clinical decision support vastly more difficult          than it needs to be               Furthermore the inpatient and outpatient systems in          most healthcare systems are disconnected Rarely can          providers access outpatient medical information from the          inpatient setting or vice versa Yet this information is          absolutely pivotal to providing safe efficient medical          care after all a patients allergies are the same both          inside and outside the hospital Covering for another          physicians patient panel is vastly easier safer and          more efficient when their medical record  especially          their problems medications and test results  can be          instantly accessed Transfers from acute care to          longterm care or homecare are also problematic often          little information is transferred with the patient In          general outpatient care is much more fragmented than          inpatient care and would likely benefit even more from          computerization and communication of information than          inpatient care          The lack of electronic information also limits quality          reporting Most organizations report externally for both          inpatients and outpatients using only claims data as          required by state and federal agencies this is sometimes          supplemented by chart review These claims data lack          clinical detail so that reports on Pap smear rates do          not take into account for example whether a woman has          had a hysterectomy     Internally organizations          generally have information that is somewhat better          although this information is often sharply limited For          example organizations may assess the rates at which          groups of patients eg with congestive heart failure          are compliant with a few guidelines using chart          review                          How quality improvement is currently done          Quality improvement in healthcare today is going on at          many levels but is generally poorly coordinated          Organizations practices hospitals and insurers all          have programs intended to improve quality but many of          these programs overlap and most are of marginal          impact          While the science of quality improvement has grown          dramatically in recent years many relatively ineffective          approaches remain the workhorses of change especially          with regard to physician behavior In particular          education continues to be a mainstay and is often          carried out through lectures and newsletters While this          kind of passive education clearly plays some role          studies repeatedly demonstrate that its effect is modest          and wanes rapidly when discontinued              The other main strategies for changing physician          behavior include feedback financial incentives          rationing and penalties     Feedback  when given at          all  is typically aggregate and retrospective Sometimes          providers do get lists of patients who are out of          compliance for a certain measure such as mammography but          these lists while useful are often inaccurate because          they are based on claims data and they cover only a tiny          proportion of the issues that might be addressed          Financial incentives eg capitation and rationing          eg formularies clearly work but are resented by          physicians and can be hard to implement Penalties          create even more resentment and are generally          counterproductive          A more effective approach to changing physician          behavior appears to be provision of realtime education          and feedback while providers are delivering care using          clinical decision support Such decision support improves          decisionmaking and adherence to guidelines    and          is generally wellaccepted by providers It is most          effective if delivered in concert with other behavior          changing approaches including education and          retrospective feedback          Another highly effective approach for improving          quality is to use industrial quality improvement          techniques to address and retool specific processes          generally with multidisciplinary teams     Many of          the processes within medicine were never consciously          designed Judicious introduction of IT into many of these          processes may be helpful                          How quality is currently measured          Today most quality measurement within organizations          is done using claims data which lack clinical detail          Cases are aggregated using diagnosisrelated groups          DRGs which are assigned posthoc and may not accurately          represent patients clinical presentations The outcomes          most frequently assessed are mortality length of stay          and charges though increasingly costs are being measured          as well For most conditions mortality is sufficiently          low to be meaningless and even for conditions with          higher mortality organizations often do not perform          severity adjustment because of the difficulty of doing          so although increasingly good adjusters are becoming          available     Length of stay can be decreased with          enough focus and effort and it is useful for cost          reduction efforts but is hardly a comprehensive quality          measure          The variables most amenable to change are process          measures and many have been associated with improved          longterm outcomes       Examples include          doortoneedle time in patients with suspected myocardial          infarction use of appropriate antibiotics in patients          with communityacquired pneumonia and use of          betablockers in patients with cardiac ischemia However          such process measures are difficult or impossible to          extract from claims data and costly chart review is          typically needed in todays system As a result most          organizations measure only a few of these at one time          because of the high cost of doing so Moreover for          complications or adverse events the standard is to rely          on selfreport by providers which dramatically          underestimates the frequency of these events              Even among institutions which are leaders in quality          measurement the current state of the art is to compare          crude outcomes by condition from claims data typically          using resources such as the University Hospital          Consortium database which includes information like          length of stay and morbidity and mortality data              Such comparisons can be useful and result in          identification of problems that can be addressed in an          organization for example if high mortality is identified          in patients with communityacquired pneumonia but these          comparisons often aggregate disparate groups of patients          involve long lag times and lack clinical detail In          addition the data may or may not be used by those          actually delivering care          The recent interest in quality by payors and          regulators has resulted in a multitude of requests for          quality data which is overwhelming the limited resources          of quality managers in most organizations especially as          most call for process data which organizations do not          have at hand Typically healthcare has devoted a tiny          fraction of its overall revenues to quality measurement          and management so that it is not surprising that there          is little reserve                          The evidence on quality and IT          While increasing the use of IT in healthcare would          result in benefits in several domains the quality          benefits will probably be some of the largest In          particular this would improve the likelihood that          processes will be successful and would allow delivery of          evidencebased decision support to providers narrowing          the gaps between evidence and practice          Many studies now show that computerization of          reminders and prevention guidelines improves adherence              Reminders are especially important in the care of          chronic conditions which represent a large proportion of          expenditures     Management of these conditions          requires tracking on the part of patients as well as          excellent communication between providers and patients          regarding tracking and deviations this will be made          dramatically easier with IT          It will also be possible to improve safety in a          variety of ways by increasing the use of IT             including introducing checks for problems highlighting          and communicating information about key abnormalities to          providers so they receive a rapid response and          facilitating communication between providers          Communication between patients and providers is also          vitally important for safety especially outside the          hospital In one study of outpatient adverse drug events          a large proportion of events could have been prevented or          ameliorated with better communication between patients          and providers              Compared to direct improvement quality measurement is          even more profoundly affected when information is stored          electronically in electronic medical records which are          vastly richer than claims databases It becomes possible          to routinely find patients with certain conditions to          ask questions about their recent laboratory values and          even to go through their notes to look for certain          issues like new problems               Finally electronic records can be linked with public          health surveillance The events of September           underscore the obvious need to improve these links                                       The financial case for IT and quality          Overall disappointingly few studies have examined the          financial case for IT and quality and doing so is          methodologically challenging But in other industries          investment was made because it made sense and not          because of randomized controlled trials          That being said some data are available although          most relate to individual features or applications For          example in a randomized controlled trial Tierney et al          found that use of computerized physician order entry as          compared to paper ordering resulted in  lower          charges p and  lower costs p                They believed that many of the benefits were seen because          of delivery of computerized decision support at the time          of ordering Our group found that implementation of          computerized physician order entry resulted in a           decrease in the serious medication error rate                       In other nonclinical domains for example in the          evaluation of electronic claims processing vs manual          processing electronic processing will clearly have          benefits although relatively few data are available          Similarly changes that result in greater efficiencies in          patient and specimen movement as well as decreased work          for staff will likely be highly beneficial although the          impact is difficult to measure          To assess the overall costs and benefits of an          electronic medical record system Kian    constructed          a costbenefit model for a hypothetical computerbased          patient record system planned for the MD Anderson          Cancer Center and predicted that over a year period          the total costs would be  million and the total          benefits would be  million In the ambulatory          setting Renner performed a study of a physician          ambulatory care medical group and estimated a net present          value for the EMR system of               Less direct evidence comes from a recent study          suggesting that organizations that invest more in IT are          more efficient     The most wired hospitals had          lower median expenses per discharge and greater          productivity as measured by fulltime equivalent staff          FTE per adjusted occupied bed paid hours per adjusted          discharge and net patient revenue per FTE However          differences in clinical outcomes were less clear in          cardiovascular disease and obstetrics the most wired          appeared to perform better but were similar with the          nations average across the other  categories          studied          Taken together these data suggest that benefits can          be demonstrated for specific applications and domains          However many benefits will take time to be realized and          may accrue across a sufficiently broad range of areas          that it will be hard to attribute them directly to          changes in IT Nonetheless the aggregate data do suggest          that better IT in healthcare as in other industries is          associated with greater efficiency and will be associated          with higher quality as well                          How recent changes including the internet affect          the equation          Several recent changes in information technology make          rapid adoption of IT in healthcare especially attractive          One is that the cost of computer processing continues to          decline Another more profound change is the Internet          which essentially represents an inexpensive broadly          distributed platform that is ubiquitously available even          to small or geographically remote sites This makes it          possible to distribute information and knowledge at very          low costs This will affect the delivery of software and          data for quality improvement measurement and research          For example in one large ongoing study investigators          have set up an approach in which identifiable data remain          local due to privacy issues but analyses are conducted          centrally using deidentified data Mirrored code is sent          out to individual sites via the internet to minimize          programming burden     Finally handheld devices          will increasingly allow extension of desktop systems and          will be used for many routine tasks such as capturing          vital signs or administering medications                          Vision of quality improvement          The highquality health care information systems of          the future will be vastly different from those of today          Longitudinal medical records will allow tracking of          patients conditions and medications so that providers in          emergency rooms and hospitals will have detailed          information at their fingertips Clinicians will document          using structured tools that allow capture of patient          symptoms clinical findings and the physicians          assessment The interdisciplinary teams that manage          patients with chronic conditions will be able to track          their panels and seamlessly exchange information When          patients are admitted to a hospital they will be tracked          from the instant they enter the hospital until they          leave Because diagnoses will be entered early          guidelines will be made available to providers It will          be easy to see where a patient physically is at any time          where they are in their hospital course what their          treatment is and whether guidelines are being followed          In one controlled trial simply posting the expected          length of stay for patients by condition resulted in a          decreased length of stay    and this sort of thing          will be done routinely in a variety of clinical          situations Both patients and providers will have a          better sense of what will occur and when and this will          result in higher satisfaction in both groups When          patients leave the hospital their information will go          with them to the team responsible for posthospital care          This system will include safety nets that are not present          today so that if a patient does not arrive in clinic          after a hospitalization someone will go looking for          them Such nets are conspicuously absent in todays          system          Much of the quality improvement that is done will          revolve around refinement of specific processes for          example the process of getting a patient through a          cardiac catheterization the medication process or the          process of dealing with diabetic outpatients with poor          glycemic control Teams will have not only the          information they now have but also detailed time data          information about how often processes fail or are          delayed and information about the outcomes of processes          They will also have better outcome data which patients          will provide          Patients will be a much more active part of care They          will have much more information and control and will          interact with the healthcare system outside of visits          much more than is usual today Selfmanagement will be          the norm for chronic conditions     All of this will          be facilitated by IT by patient websites that allow them          to interact with their providers by integrated networks          within healthcare organizations and by electronic          records that are the backbone for these functions Thus          diabetics will enter glucose and blood pressure results          on their website receive suggestions regarding changes          in management to improve their control and be notified          when they are overdue for preventive measures like eye or          foot exams                          Vision of quality measurement          Quality measurement depends even more on use and          integration of information technology than does quality          improvement In the future it will become routine to          measure quality on an ongoing basis for many conditions          and processes and this measurement will take place as          care is provided and be integrated into the fabric of          routine care For example for a patient with a myocardial          infarction the time they are first seen by emergency          technicians the time they arrive at the emergency          department and the time they get to the catheterization          laboratory will all be routinely logged In addition the          time when many key medications were given will be          recorded as will a number of key historical and physical          findings Nurses and physicians will chart using tools          that capture key data in structured format This will          facilitate both clinical care and research so that for          example patients with cardiogenic shock can be rapidly          identified and offered the opportunity to participate in          controlled trials          Gathering these types of data will then dramatically          facilitate process improvement because it will be          possible to address issues of variation and to determine          where delays and suboptimal outcomes are occurring          Riskadjusted comparisons within and among institutions          will be possible which will allow overall improvement          like that which has been achieved by a few isolated          groups such as the Northern New England Cardiovascular          Collaborative                              Barriers to change          Perhaps the most difficult and problematic barrier to          adoption of qualityrelated IT is that incentives for          adopting such changes are lacking under the current          reimbursement system For example under feeforservice          reimbursement there is no financial incentive for          hospitals to reduce adverse event rates Even under          prospective or capitated reimbursement justifying          investment in technology that will result in longerterm          benefit may be hard for capitalstrapped organizations          In contrast technologies like magnetic resonance imaging          scanners result in billable services and hospitals have          had no trouble making these investments          An additional issue with the current reimbursement          system is that providers are not reimbursed for care that          occurs outside encounters Reform of the payment system          to reward such care is badly needed     Also support          for collecting quality measurement data is necessary                       Legal issues relating to this area also represent an          important barrier For example the Stark laws make          difficult some collaborations that would be beneficial          for example for an integrated delivery system to support          implementation of electronic records in affiliated          physician offices          Another problem has been that information systems are          highly complex and provide uncertain return on          investment Because of the complexity of information          systems an organization will generally be best off          developing a longterm relationship with one or a few          vendors because of issues relating to connectivity          Because of this the approach of vendors in this domain          has been to develop nonstandard software and to hold          tightly to its client base Making a transition from one          vendor to another today is difficult because of the lack          of standards          A further key issue is the wide array of healthcare          organizations and the highly disparate nature of groups          ranging from solo practitioners and small hospitals to          large hospitals and large integrated delivery systems A          solution that is effective in a large hospital may not          work in a much smaller one However the internet should          make it possible to deliver applications to a wide array          of even geographically remote sites at low cost          A further barrier relates to privacy confidentiality          and security of health information Todays laws          regarding these issues relate mainly to a paper world and          are inadequate     While the Health Insurance          Portability and Accessibility Act HIPAA begins to          address some of the relevant issues much remains to be          done Thus while additional legislation is needed it          must be crafted in ways that make a revolution in          healthcare information possible and do not paralyze this          revolution     Specifically it might become          extremely difficult to do clinical research if new          legislation is too restrictive to address many issues          access to large populations is critical Technically it          is feasible today to ensure data safety but much work is          needed in this domain to develop laws and regulation that          adequately balance privacy concerns with the quality          benefits that may be realized through use of health          information                              Policy Implications                      Standards            An absolutely pivotal early step is establishment of            national standards for key medical domains including            messaging problems and conditions laboratory and            radiology data medication data and pathology results                Until recently adequate standards were not            available but that has rapidly changed and a number            of other nations including England have taken the            approach of establishing national standards requiring            that if vendors want to participate in delivery of            information technology they must adhere to these            standards     This makes it possible for a market            to continue to function but under certain rules            analogous to setting up a rule for a discussion that            everyone can talk as long as they speak English                                Incentives            Probably the most important step in achieving this            vision is to establish incentives that make it            attractive for organizations to invest in information            technology While nonfinancial incentives will play            some role for example giving organizations special            recognition if they implement certain processes or can            demonstrate they have excellent outcomes financial            incentives are likely to be more important for            achieving major change These could take the form of            grants tax credits or lowinterest loans to            organizations making major investments in areas that            have been demonstrated to improve care Another option            that has been suggested is differential payment scales            depending on whether or not a technology such as            computerized physician order entry is in use or not            which has been recommended by the Medicare Patient            Advisory Commission     Examples of the type of            financial incentives already in play that could provide            good starts include legislation already under            consideration by Congress The Medication Errors            Reduction Act of  introduced to the Senate by            Senators Graham and Snowe has been introduced also in            the House by Representatives Houghton and Thurman                This proposal would provide nearly  billion of            funding over  years for hospitals and skilled nursing            facilities to purchase information technology to            improve medication safety Another bill the Health            Information and Quality Improvement Act of  would            provide  million to help hospitals develop and use            information technology that can reduce the frequency of            medical errors     However such support would not            be sufficiently broadbased and would not substitute            for development of a National Health Information            Infrastructure            Nongovernmental groups  especially purchasers            payors and regulatory agencies  will also play            extremely important roles in developing incentives and            encouraging health care organizations to improve            quality and adopt safe practices For example the            Leapfrog group    a coalition of the nations            largest employers has identified three practice             computerized physician order entry evidencebased            hospital referral for highrisk procedures and            intensive care unit physician staffing  that they            believe will substantially improve safety Although            there are issues with each many organizations in the            areas they have targeted are actively considering            adopting these practices and this is likely a result            of their activities     Payors can adopt            contracting and reimbursement strategies that reward            organizations that use IT more effectively  for            example submitting claims electronically Regulatory            agencies can ask for quality measurement data that are            meaningful standardized and are more readily gathered            electronically                                Security and confidentiality            Security and confidentiality in information            technology also represent an urgent concern The Health            Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA            begins to address this area    but has many            problems which will need to be resolved specifically            concerning the nature of the boundaries regarding what            is permissible and what is not if interpreted broadly            HIPAA could make clinical research nearly impossible                More legislation will be needed to strike an            effective balance                                Professional involvement            Physicians nurses pharmacists and other types of            health care providers all need to become more involved            in advocating for and developing IT in healthcare and            electronic medical records This is an issue both at            the local level within institutions and among            community practitioners and for professional and            organizational leadership groups While some groups            such as the American Academy of Family Physicians have            led in this area with their work on electronic medical            records more often such professional groups are behind            in this area To deal with this more attention            including funding will need to be directed at this            area To be effective development and implementation            of new information technologies must speak to the            minutetominute needs of all types of providers                                Research            Finally while a great deal is known about what            works regarding using IT to improve quality much            remains to be learned especially regarding            implementation and dissemination of systems Key            questions remaining include how best to deliver            clinical decision support how much adjustment of            guidelines is needed for local implementation to be            successful how clinical information systems can best            be implemented and disseminated  especially to small            hospitals and communitybased providers how patients            can best be involved more than they are and the role            of the Internet and other new technologies in this            revolution                                      Summary        Healthcare in the US today is inefficient        errorprone and of variable quality Information        technology has the potential to substantially improve care        by bringing decision support to the point of care by        providing vital links and closing open loop systems and        by allowing routine quality measurement to become reality        Achieving this potential will be challenging and is far        from guaranteed but it is possible If it is to occur        substantial investment will be needed to galvanize this        change probably in large part from the federal government        with development of a national health information        infrastructure representing the most important piece of the
