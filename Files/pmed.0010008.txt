 Introduction Chronic inhalation of tobacco smoke causes progressive lung destruction in susceptible individuals resulting in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD and emphysema two well described clinical syndromes with poorly understood pathogenesis 1 2 3 A role for T helper cells in the pathogenesis of obstructive lung disease has been established with asthma where T helper 2 Th2 cells are strongly linked to both human and experimental disease 4 5 6 7 A potential role for T cells in COPD has also been suggested in several recent studies that show CD8 T cells are increased in the lungs of people who smoke 8 9 10 11 T cells cause tissue injury through their secreted products such as cytokines in mice overexpression of interleukin IL 13 a T cell cytokine that is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of experimental asthma resulted in increased production of proteases and enlargement of airspaces reminiscent of emphysema 12 Further airway limitation another characteristic of human asthma is clinically linked to an accelerated rate of loss of lung function in smoker individuals 13 It has been suggested therefore that asthma and COPD may involve the same type of recruited inflammatory cells differing only in their location within the lung 14 Chemokines their receptors and cell adhesion molecules regulate migration of immune cells into inflamed tissue 15 16 17 18 T helper 1 Th1 cells have been shown to secrete interleukin 2 and interferon gamma IFN and express a distinct repertoire of chemokine receptors such as CCR5 and CXCR3 19 20 21 In contrast Th2 cells that are biased to produce IL 4 and IL 5 express mainly CCR4 and CCR3 22 23 24 25 Immunofluorescent analysis of airway mucosal biopsies in patients with asthma showed that most T cells co express IL 4 and CCR4 but in contrast T cells in airways of patients with COPD and pulmonary sarcoidosis produce IFN and express high levels of CXCR3 while lacking CCR4 expression 26 In addition to T cells a wide variety of other inflammatory cells have been shown to express distinct chemokine receptors that are critical for their homing suggesting a universal mechanism for regulating immune responses Interferon inducible protein 10 IP 10 monokine induced by interferon gamma MIG and interferon inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant I TAC are three known ligands for CXCR3 produced by normal and injured epithelial cells and T cells that are required for homing of Th1 cells 27 28 29 In addition to regulation of chemotaxis and homing other functions have been ascribed to chemokines including modulation of T cell fate by direct effects on differentiating T cells and regulation of proteolysis in blood monocytes 19 30 In this study we determined the dominant T helper phenotype in lung samples from ex smoker individuals with moderate to severe COPD and emphysema and control individuals with no evidence of smoking related lung disease Analysis of chemokine receptor expression on isolated peripheral lung lymphocytes from ex smokers with COPD emphysema indicated that both CD4 and CD8 T helper cells are strongly polarized to the Th1 phenotype compared to T cells isolated from lung tissue of normal individuals or individuals with non smoking related obstructive lung disease The same cells spontaneously secreted more IFN and CXCR3 receptor ligands MIG and IP 10 in the COPD and emphysema group than in the group without emphysema Further IP 10 and MIG but not IFN upregulated macrophage metalloelastase matrix metalloproteinase MMP 12 from isolated lung macrophages Together our findings reveal the strong association between COPD emphysema and Th1 driven adaptive immunity suggesting a link to lung destruction mediated by IFN MIG and IP 10 Methods Participants Twenty eight non atopic ex smoker individuals see Table 1 undergoing medically necessary lung resection were serially entered into the study ten individuals with no COPD and no evidence of emphysema control group and eighteen individuals diseased group with moderate to severe COPD and evidence of emphysema as determined by pulmonary function tests high resolution computed tomography CT or conventional CT scan All participants were ex smokers who had quit smoking for a mean SD of 7 2 y and 4 2 y in COPD emphysema and control groups respectively COPD was diagnosed according to the criteria recommended by the National Institutes of Health World Health Organization workshop summary 31 Participants in the control and COPD emphysema groups had similar mean SD of 54 6 and 45 5 respectively pack year smoking histories where smoking one pack of cigarettes per day each year is defined as one pack year All participants were recruited from the surgical clinic at the Michael E DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the Methodist Hospital and were undergoing lung resection for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes Table 1 Study protocols were approved by the institutional review board for human studies and informed consent was obtained from all participants Participants had no history of allergy or asthma and had not received oral systemic corticosteroids during the last 6 mo At the time of study all participants had been free of acute symptoms suggestive of upper or lower respiratory tract infection for the 6 wk preceding the study CT Based Evaluation for Emphysema High resolution CT two in emphysema group and two in control group or conventional CT analysis was used to detect emphysema characterized by the presence of areas of low attenuation contrasted with surrounding normal lung parenchyma 32 33 CT scans were used by a radiologist to separate participants on the basis of the presence or the absence of any objective evidence for centrilobular panacinar or paraseptal emphysema with a detection limit of greater than 3 mm low attenuation density 34 Isolation of Lung Lymphocytes Lung lymphocytes were isolated by modifying established protocols using a combination of mechanical fragmentation enzyme digestion and centrifugation procedures described previously 35 36 37 Viable lymphocytes were separated from whole lung inflammatory cells macrophages eosinophils and neutrophils

tailed were used to compare differences between the two groups of subjects p 0 05 was considered statistically significant Results Th1 Immune Bias of Peripheral Lung Lymphocytes in Emphysema Inflammatory chemokines cytokines and their receptors are upregulated at sites of inflammation and play a key role in the recruitment of leukocytes to peripheral tissues in response to injury 17 39 To detect Th1 polarization we assessed lung lymphocytes for expression of CCR5 a receptor for several Th1 chemokines and CXCR3 the receptor for IP 10 I TAC and MIG We screened for the presence of Th2 cells by assessing T cell expression of CCR4 a receptor for eotaxin CCL11 macrophage chemoattractant protein 3 CCL7 and thymus and activation regulated chemokine CCL17 40 41 and CCR3 a receptor for eotaxin and related chemokines Flow cytometry revealed very low expression of CCR3 and CCR4 1 3 in control n 10 and emphysema n 18 groups and did not discriminate between these populations Figure 1A and 1B data not shown These findings were in sharp contrast to the enhanced expression of both CCR5 and CXCR3 as shown in representative histograms Figure 1A These Th1 specific chemokine receptors were expressed prominently on lung lymphocytes from all participants but their expression was significantly enhanced in the setting of emphysema Figure 1A 1C Further both CD4 and CD8 T cells expressed CCR5 at the same level Figure 1C In contrast we found highly variable expression 0 5 30 of CCR4 CXCR3 and CCR5 on peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from the same participants and this variation did not correlate with the presence of disease in either group data not shown Furthermore we compared the lung lymphocyte CCR5 and CXCR3 profiles among the eight participants with emphysema alone lung volume reduction surgery for emphysema non cancer and ten participants with emphysema and accompanying cancer lung resection for treatment of small peripheral cancer and found that these two groups cannot be distinguished based on these indices Figure 1D data not shown Although human lung macrophages are not known to express CXCR3 we suspected based on the immunohistochemical localization of this chemokine receptor that CD14 cells in the lungs of ex smoker individuals with emphysema accounted for much of the total lung CXCR3 immunoreactivity Figure 2A data not shown To confirm this we determined the percent of total lung cells expressing CD14 and CD11b which are both markers of monocytes macrophages and CXCR3 We found that over 40 of CD14 cells from participants with emphysema but not control participants were also positive for CXCR3 Figure 2 In addition there was a significant negative association between CXCR3 expression on lung T cells and the percent of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s FEV1 based on an R 2 goodness of fit statistic of 0 27 Figure 2C p 0 0089 r 0 52 Together these data indicate that a strong type 1 bias is characteristic of the T cells isolated from the peripheral lung of participants with COPD and emphysema and that this immune phenotype correlates with the lung destruction that is characteristic of this disease Further we have shown for the first time to our knowledge that CXCR3 expression a marker of Th1 inflammation extends to lung monocytes and macrophages IFN IP 10 and MIG But Not IL 4 Are Expressed by Lung Lymphocytes We sought additional functional data to confirm the apparent Th1 bias of peripheral lung inflammatory cells isolated from ex smoker individuals Freshly isolated lung lymphocytes that were not otherwise manipulated secreted high levels of IFN MIG and IP 10 with significantly greater secretion of both cytokines from lymphocytes of participants with emphysema Figure 3A 3C Interestingly we could not detect appreciable amounts of I TAC another known ligand for CXCR3 in lung lymphocytes of control participants or those with emphysema data not shown Similar results were obtained using intracytoplasmic cytokine staining of the same cells Figure 3D in which PMA ionomycin stimulation strongly induced IFN production from CD69 CD8 lung lymphocytes Surface staining for CD4 was not feasible with this protocol however the percentage of CD8 IFN cells was approximately equal to that of CD8 IFN cells median SD 19 6 versus 16 4 respectively Because total numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells were approximately equivalent this suggests that non CD8 IFN cells are largely CD4 and therefore Th1 cells Finally the typical Th2 cytokine IL 4 was not detected in either group as determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay or intracytoplasmic cytokine staining Figure 3E data not shown confirming the marked Th1 bias of the immune response that underlies smoking related lung inflammation and emphysema IP 10 and MIG But Not IFN Directly Upregulate MMP12 through CXCR3 Emphysema and irreversible airway limitation that is characteristic of chronic tobacco smoking are related to the destruction of elastin and the resulting loss of lung elastic recoil Therefore to be relevant to the pathogenesis of airway obstruction type 1 inflammation must be shown to promote lung elastolysis Because loss of elastin is regulated by proteinases 42 we next determined if expression of MMPs in particular the elastases MMP9 and MMP12 was regulated by IP 10 MIG and IFN the principal cytokines detected in emphysematous lung Indeed isolated peripheral lung macrophages but not isolated blood monocytes secreted MMP12 in response to IP 10 and MIG but not IFN Figure 4A data not shown These findings reflect a specific receptor ligand interaction because in the presence of a CXCR3 function blocking antibody IP 10 failed to induce MMP12 Figure 4B Furthermore immunohistochemical studies revealed that lung macrophages of participants with emphysema but not control participants specifically express MMP12 Figure 4C and 4D Together these findings indicate that Th1 but not Th2 cytokines and related chemokines are required for establishing the pro elastolytic lung environment that underlies human emphysema Discussion In this investigation we characterized T cells and lung macrophages isolated from emphysematous and non emphysematous human lungs Three principal findings emerge from our study First rather than being functionally diverse as suggested by the heterogeneous nature of humans lung T cells of ex smoker individuals with emphysema are relatively homogeneous and characterized by a marked Th1 bias Second the principal Th1 chemokines MIG and IP 10 are linked to a pro elastolytic lung environment because these cytokines upregulate the elastase MMP12 which is associated with emphysema Finally we found no significant expression of Th2 chemokine receptors such as CCR3 and CCR4 or IL 4 production in lung lymphocytes Together our findings demonstrate the role of the adaptive immune response in COPD and suggest a primary role for Th1 cells in controlling the main smoking related physiologic and structural changes of the lung Upregulation of CCR5 and CXCR3 on T cells and accumulation of these cells in the lung periphery suggest that aberrant unremitting pulmonary recruitment of these activated T cells is unique to people with smoking related lung disease despite cessation of exposure to the inciting agent tobacco smoke We showed that ex smoker individuals without obstructive lung disease or emphysema have comparatively little Th1 biased inflammation in their lungs thus our findings reflect the inflammatory changes that are unique to the COPD microenvironment Additionally lung lymphocytes isolated from four lifelong non smoker individuals with severe obstructive lung disease due to cystic fibrosis or bronchiolitis obliterans did not show a Th1 inflammatory bias of the lung S Grumelli F Kheradmand D B Corry unpublished data This information confirmed our finding that the predominant Th1 bias in COPD emphysema reflects the microenvironment unique to the lungs of ex smoker individuals The prevalence of asthma among people who smoke is currently not known but in order to study COPD emphysema in a population without other confounding variables people who might have had asthma were excluded and thus our findings are restricted to non asthmatic individuals with emphysema Our use of T cell chemokine receptor expression analysis to determine recruitment of lung T cells is not without precedent Analysis by immunohistochemistry of airway mucosa of people with atopic asthma after antigen challenge revealed that large numbers of CCR4 and CCR8 T cells express IL 4 and CCR4 expression was prominent in people with severe atopic dermatitis which decreased upon abatement of disease activity 26 43 Immunostaining of T cells in synovial fluid from individuals with rheumatoid arthritis showed that virtually all of the T cells associated with inflamed joints expressed CXCR3 and CCR5 representing significant enrichment compared to blood T cells from the same participants Furthermore previous studies of smoker individuals with COPD and normal lung function showed the presence of CD8 CXCR3 T cells in the airway epithelium and submucosa 44 We extend these findings by showing CXCR3 expression on lung macrophages and CD4 T cells in emphysema patients and the functional interplay between Th1 related chemokines and elastolytic MMPs In addition to detailing surface chemokine receptor expression we have functionally confirmed the marked Th1 bias of peripheral lung T cells demonstrating that either at rest or following stimulation these cells secrete IFN and not IL 4 Our findings therefore confirm the utility of chemokine receptor expression patterns in the initial assessment of T cell effector phenotype Destruction of lung parenchyma in emphysema is thought to occur through excessive proteolysis mediated by the elastin degrading enzymes MMP2 MMP9 and MMP12 from the MMP family and by neutrophil elastase from the serine proteinase family 45 46 Cytokines and chemokines are substrates for MMPs but they also regulate expression of MMPs under pathological conditions 47 48 We have shown here that IP 10 and MIG two chemokines that are secreted from lung lymphocytes of participants with emphysema upregulate specifically MMP12 and thus favor a proteolytic microenvironment that facilitates lung destruction Strengthening the association between lung macrophages and IP 10 MIG dependent MMP12 secretion is the fact that we have demonstrated that in humans macrophages like T cells express CXCR3 and that this receptor is required for MMP12 secretion in response to IP 10 MIG stimulation In addition to defining the predominant immune phenotype of emphysematous lung these additional findings implicate the principal cell macrophage MMP MMP12 and effector cytokines IFN IP 10 and MIG as likely underlying smoking induced lung destruction We have further shown that these enzymes may be regulated by proximal immune events driven by Th1 cells or Th1 associated cytokines A question of major importance for future study is therefore the nature of the antigens and adjuvant factors that ultimately drive this inflammatory response Although this was an entirely human study our findings show remarkable parallels with studies performed in mice MMP12 deficiency has been shown to protect mice against emphysema after chronic exposure to cigarette smoke implying that MMP12 may be the key proteinase in the development of emphysema in this species 49 50 Studies from both humans and mice therefore firmly suggest the importance of MMP12 in the pathogenesis of emphysema Interestingly in addition to solubilizing elastin MMP12 is the MMP most efficient at degrading 1 antitrypsin the primary physiological inhibitor of human leukocyte elastase 51 52 Thus chemokine induced upregulation of MMP12 may orchestrate lung matrix degradation both directly and indirectly through inactivation of 1 antitrypsin The therapy of COPD and emphysema is currently limited to pharmacologic bronchodilation to relieve dyspnea antibiotics for intercurrent respiratory tract infection and vaccination against prominent respiratory pathogens Aside from efforts to prevent smoking or encourage cessation there exist no measures that prevent development of emphysema or treat the specific causes of airway obstruction By providing insight into the immunopathogenesis of COPD our findings provide genuine hope that future therapies capable of preventing or halting smoking related lung disease may be possible
