 Turkish Delight Le Monde of Paris led its Sunday Monday edition with a lament about European impotence in relation to the Russian onslaught on Chechnya It said that the 15 leaders of the European Union meeting in Helsinki this weekend managed to achieve nothing more than timid warnings to Moscow that they would suspend certain cooperation agreements if it didn t stop bombing the Chechens In response Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said he understood the concerns about the humanitarian situation in the north Caucasus but rejected any change of tactics in achieving the destruction of terrorism Lib ration of Paris led Monday with a report that 40 000 people are trapped in Grozny unable to escape the Russian noose The paper also ran an interview with the powerful Russian media mogul Boris Berezovsky in which he called the Chechnya conflict a just war claimed Chechen military leaders have received funds from radical foreign extremist circles that I will not name and said there should be no more talk of Chechen independence In that the United States and Europe support us he said The Russian Constitution must prevail in Chechnya But Berezovsky also criticized the Russian government for failing to seize opportunities for negotiation Even so he said he would vote for the politically inexperienced Putin in the next Russian presidential election because he has two qualities that no other candidate offers He is a reformer and he is extremely determined Le Monde s editorial was devoted to the Helsinki agreement to establish a joint European rapid deployment force to intervene in trouble spots such as the former Yugoslavia It called this a spectacular affirmation of Europe s desire to exist by itself without the help of the United States going far beyond present forms of military cooperation among European countries The death of Franjo Tudjman the first president of independent Croatia was also a big story in Europe with some commentators seeing it as a positive development for peace in the Balkans The Daily Telegraph of London reported that according to the Dutch news agency ANP the War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague had been planning to indict Tudjman for atrocities in Bosnia In its obituary of Tudjman the Times of London said he had had a shadowy relationship with the United States In 1994 and 1995 it was American military backing and training that helped Tudjman and his new army to expel around 300 000 Serbs from areas they had seized at the start of the Yugoslav disintegration in 1991 it said For Slate s take on Tudjman see this The Guardian of London fronted a report Monday that British Prime Minister Tony Blair has categorically ruled that the 2 500 year old sculptures from the frieze of the Parthenon in Athens known in Britain as the Elgin Marbles should not be returned to Greece The Greek government recently stepped up its long running campaign to get them back and got the British Museum to admit that it bungled their restoration in 1938 Greece is poised to make a new request for the sculptures return as part of a deal to coincide with the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens Greece wants to house the marbles in a new museum to be built under the Acropolis The sculptures were bought in 1803 from the then Turkish authorities in Athens by the British aristocrat Lord Elgin who subsequently donated them to the British Museum The Guardian said Blair intends to proceed sensitively in order to avoid further antagonizing the Greeks The last thing Mr Blair wants is another row with a fellow European Union member when he is already at loggerheads with the French about beef and the Germans over the withholding tax the paper said But a row seems to be inevitable The report surprised some observers who thought that the British government would agree to the return of the sculptures A recent editorial in the National Post of Canada a conservative daily assumed that this was the case and said it would elevate historic sentiment over legality creating in the process a chaotic precedent for dispersing the world s great archaeological collections The Post also accused British Hellenophiles of double standards by not supporting the return of stolen treasures to the non European Turks To do so would be to admit that Turkey like Greece is legitimately part of Europe it said But at the Helsinki summit the European Union finally agreed to accept Turkey as a candidate for EU membership Turkey s desire to join the European club has hitherto been thwarted by its historic enemy Greece already a member and by European concerns about its human rights record La Repubblica of Rome led its front page Sunday with a report that as part of its concessions to Europe Turkey has agreed to abolish the death penalty offering hope for the rebel Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan who has been sentenced to death for terrorism The Turkish parliament must approve his execution before it can be carried out According to the Turkish Daily News Sunday President Bill Clinton was among world leaders who telephoned Ankara to urge acceptance of the EU s conditions Turkish papers generally rejoiced at the agreement They carried headlines such as Turkey is in the EU family Turkish Daily News and The first Muslim candidate Hurriyet Writing Monday in Hurriyet columnist Tufan Terenc said This has sealed Turkey s future and led it to the point of no return As Israel prepares for peace talks with Syria in Washington this week the Jerusalem Post gave an upbeat assessment of the prospects leading its front page with a forecast by Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shara that a peace deal could be reached within a few months It also offered a foretaste of what was billed as an optimistic speech to the Knesset Monday by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak According to the Post he will say that peace is within our reach and anticipate an agreement that will burst apart the sense of threat on both sides do away with fear and suspicion and burn out terror Nearly all British newspapers carried front page photographs Monday of Muhammad Ali receiving the BBC s Sports Personality of the Century award at a ceremony in London So Sad was the tabloid Daily Mirror s headline referring to Ali s physical condition but most papers ran eulogies of the former boxing hero The Times sports commentator Simon Barnes called Ali the most reckless spendthrift of himself that the world of sport has ever seen Barnes wrote These days he comes to audiences not to milk their applause but to give audiences something worth applauding It is he that is doing the giving the audience that does the receiving In an interview with the Daily Mail Ali s fourth wife Lonnie said I believe Muhammad s role is to unite people throughout the world in peace He is one of those rare individuals like the late Princess Diana who can walk anywhere and be well received by millions regardless of age race or social background All papers quoted Ali s remark on accepting the award I had a great time boxing I enjoyed it and I may come back
