 Getting Past the Past Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Dear Prudence I was adopted and grew up in a very abusive home I don t seem to be able to get past the bitterness and resentment I feel for my parents For years I have wanted to confront them about the beatings I took my mother s drinking and my dad s complete indifference At 30 years old I am sober and reasonably successful despite having not completed my bachelor s degree in accounting I ve had my own struggle with alcoholism and I have difficulty concentrating on much else besides how I grew up though I m trying to get past it Meanwhile probably to assuage their guilt my folks constantly ask me questions such as Did we raise you right It is hard to bite my tongue and lie to them telling them they spent plenty of quality time with me etc My fiancee has been very supportive and has suggested that when my folks open the door with their questions that I should take advantage of it and unload What s your take Closed door in D C Dear Closed It certainly sounds as though your parents have accumulated many debits in your emotional ledger Prudie salutes you for pulling yourself together considering some overwhelming obstacles It s clear that you need to unburden yourself either to a counselor or to your folks Until all the resentment gets out it will eat away at the vessel it is stored in you It is interesting and Prudie thinks meaningful that your parents continually pose these questions At some level of consciousness they know the answers This might be their way of asking you to give voice to your feelings and to confront them You certainly have nothing to lose Next time such a question is posed ask them if they really want the answer If they say yes then try to hold yourself together and as calmly as you can give a truthful response Tears are OK hollering is not This may be what they ve been waiting for so that they can talk about the past and apologize They as well as you might need to give the disastrous past an airing A repair is possible but if it doesn t happen you ve unburdened yourself let in some sunlight and lost nothing Prudie is for realism and honesty and hopes the balance sheet comes out with an improved bottom line Prudie encouragingly Dear Prudence After 20 years of marriage and raising our children my husband and I have decided to stop torturing each other We broke the news of the divorce gently to friends and relatives and now are in the process of dividing 20 years of assets Because we see no sense in causing more financial distress than necessary we are still under the same roof while we work out the details The problem is We are not enemies It seems no one can stand this and whenever we encounter friends or relatives they invariably ask personal questions to try to get each of us to speak ill of the other As we don t do this the next comment is always something like Well then why are you getting divorced The worst one was I don t think you really want a divorce or you would have gotten one by now Please do you have an answer for these well wishers that would not require giving them private and personal information shan Dear sha Who are your friends a bunch of divorce lawyers Prudie thinks it s marvelous that you and your spouse of two decades are able to unhitch in a civilized amiable manner Unfortunately it has become a commonplace for about to be exes to badmouth each other to whomever will listen Friendly divorces are somewhat unusual but possible Prudie has even had one The next time one of these yentas tries to goad you into dishing your soon to be former mate just smile and say Oh I am saving our life together for my memoirs That kind of non answer always conveys the subtext nothing forthcoming here on to the next subject Prudie admiringly Dear Prudence For my roommate s birthday last year I took her out to a very expensive restaurant and bought her a nice gift One month later for my birthday she took me to a relatively cheap Mexican restaurant and gave me a Beanie Baby I hate stuffed animals and she knows that We are both in similar financial situations and I felt cheated Her birthday is coming up soon Should I take her out again or just give her a small gift and forget our tradition of the birthday dinner Living With Selfish Dear Liv If you are sure that the two of you are in financially similar circumstances and also that she knows of your dislike for stuffed animals Prudie suggests you send out for Chinese food for her birthday dinner and give her back the Beanie Baby with a funny card Prudie says this because the roomie is obviously cheap and maybe even hostile If she remarks on the tradition being different for her birthday this year than last simply tell her that you are following her lead about what level of celebration is appropriate This may totally louse up the living situation so be prepared Because you refer to her as selfish however you may not wish to keep this arrangement going forever Maybe stick a birthday candle into the fortune cookie Prudie reciprocally Dear Prudence During college my best friend was a fellow named Jay We operated a small business together and continued daily contact for over 10 years Things have gone smoothly for for Jay He moved to Washington D C and has worked as a high ranking government official Since his move however our friendship has hit some snags He hangs out with pompous members of the political establishment has grown arrogant and doesn t have time to return my calls Late last week I heard that Jay is getting married to the youngest daughter of a political crony and has failed to invite me Here s where I m stuck Even though my feelings are hurt should I send Jay a polite note of congratulations Shall I assume our friendship is over because he didn t invite me I welcome your insightful advice Joey Dear Jo The fact that Jay didn t invite you by itself would not signal the friendship s end but the too busy to return phone calls does You two have obviously grown apart Time and Life not the magazines often cool formerly warm relationships Prudie thinks it would be fine as a tip of the hat to what used to be to write him a congratulatory note if that is your inclination Don t do it however if its purpose would be 1 to get an invitation or 2 to give him the needle Just by the by it sounds as if you disapprove of this man s pompous friends and growing arrogance so give the friendship a decent burial emotionally remember the good times and move on Prudie realistically
