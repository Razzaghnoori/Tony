        ah i guess my personal opinion i i dont mind paying taxes necessarily i I just sometimes wonder if our moneys being used in the best way     right   ah sometimes when i hear what what theyre even what even what the politicians are making you know when when theyre getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that ah i think thats just a bit too much to be paying them ah and thats all tax money when you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much its just billions of dollars thats i think is just being thrown away   right right and then when you read about that theyre spending all the money on you know these studies that have no relevance whatsoever that kind of ticks you off too but uh   yeah   somebody somebody was telling me the other day that they heard some senator say that what were paying its not that we mind paying taxes its that were paying too much for a lousy government   yeah   and i i i tend to agree with that im not really into   yeah   what theyre doing per se and i think theres just too many too many levels of bureaucracy   yeah   i think it can be can be managed by by less ah less levels   yeah yeah well i i know anytime theres theres a big uh uh budget cut you know i work with the state and anytime theres there is a budget cut or crunches its always the small guy that that gets hurt   right   its never the uh the person thats making a hundred thousand there its always the person thats making the least amount and   right   ah and and sometimes were running around there i see these these ah ah supervisors running around ah having meetings i i really dont know what they do i sometimes wonder are are they really doing anything or   right right well i think were gonna see a streamlining in the government i just you know i i dont know what kind of uh i dont know what what level or  what how long it will take for you know our country to start the public in general to start saying hey this is too much were not gonna pay anymore you know were not gonna pay for this and youre out you know i think were starting to see it a little bit now but i think uh i dont know what what kind of input were gonna get from the public and how theyre gonna go about doing it because i think i think were just getting taxed way too much i mean right now were getting taxed probably   yeah   probably around thirty five percent or more and thats thats you know thats me not making a whole lot of money   yeah well they got so many hidden taxes that its really hard to figure out how much you are paying because go to a grocery store or something like that and youre paying a little tax here and you   well right   so yeah gas i dont know about you guys i but theres probably at least about twenty five to to thirty cents of different taxes on on our gas   right   and you dont realize it   yeah we got a sales tax our sales tax is like eight percent and i dont know what our gas tax is i think its somewhere around twenty five cents a gallon   yeah   so i mean theyre hitting us up and they may not they may not raise it you know federally as much one year but then theyll raise it somewhere in the state or the or the sales tax or property tax or whatever its just i mean you can see that youre money is just not going that far   yeah well i know they say like with Reagan they say no new taxes but they changed the ah deductions on you and that just raises your taxes you know they just get it a different way   right   so i mean to me it did uh raise my taxes   right well i mean you can tell just by just by how much money you have left over and all of a sudden i dont know its just its eating me alive   yeah i i heard someone say that uh if they would just  something about uh with the uh the defense budget all that extra money theyre throwing back if they cut back by so much percentage it could throw back about six hundred dollars on an average six hundred dollars
