 The Republican Presidential Hopeful After his excruciating performance in the 1996 Republican presidential campaign Lamar Alexander should have had the grace to disappear quietly into the Tennessee backwoods But here we are a full 900 days before the 2000 election and Alexander is running again airing ads in Iowa fund raising pandering mounting his high horse and doing all the other unappetizing things a presidential candidate must do Alexander who has been campaigning for president more or less nonstop since 1993 is the very model of the Republican Presidential Hopeful or RPH but he s hardly alone With no Republican heir apparent the 2000 race promises to be the wildest GOP primary in a generation There are by my count two dozen Republicans considered at least by their own estimation viable 2000 candidates is the full list And an astonishing number of them are already engaged in all but official campaigns desperate quests to become an early favorite The will be candidates are competing fiercely for donors staff volunteers endorsements A caveat Not all the potential candidates are pre campaigning George W Bush and Elizabeth Dole for example have carefully avoided any presidential posturing So who is the RPH What are defining qualities The RPH is not easily deterred Anyone who would spend three years of his life pursuing an office that he has no reasonable hope of winning must be irrepressible The RPH isn t bothered by the fact that he s been routed before Alexander Alan Keyes Pete Wilson Pat Buchanan Steve Forbes Jack Kemp that he s the most hated man in politics Newt Gingrich that he s a national joke Dan Quayle that hardly anyone outside his home state has heard of him John Ashcroft Bob Smith George Pataki Tom Ridge John Kasich Tommy Thompson that most voters will confuse him with an S L crook Frank Keating the governor of Oklahoma he s never heard of you either or that he might not get elected if he were the next to last American alive Gary Bauer The RPH pretends he isn t actually running It s tacky to be campaigning for president in the first half of 1998 so even though everyone knows he s going to run the RPH generally insists he isn t a candidate He has devised a number of lies and half truths to convey this It s not something I m thinking about right now Rudolph Giuliani He won t decide until 1999 Quayle for another year Kasich until after the 1998 elections lots of them It s just an exploratory committee Keyes It s very premature to talk about it Pataki I m extremely flattered by the speculation but a worthier candidate will certainly come along Bauer My focus is entirely on the state of ______ Christie Todd Whitman and other governors Instead of appearing to be the grasping pol he is the RPH exudes the impression that he won t run unless the American people plead for his candidacy Rare is the politician who doesn t hear that plea The RPH says he has a real job but he doesn t Some RPHs do actually work for a living Sitting governors members of Congress Dole and Bauer all hold real jobs But often the RPH has a simulacrum of a career the kind of work that is an excuse to spend every waking minute campaigning That means you Keyes Alexander Quayle Kemp Buchanan Would you dare say your job is professional presidential candidate The RPH claims he is working for the good of America or the Republican Party or both What exactly does this work consist of Much of it is giving speeches Forbes has made nearly 300 over the last 18 months The rest of the RPH s work is running his political action committee or grass roots advocacy group This group has a magnificent patriotic name Campaign for a New American Century Live Free or Die Solutions America Spirit of America Click to play a game Match the RPH to his group The RPH s group has ambitious goals to advocate the flat tax Forbes to draft an agenda for a new American century Alexander to build and strengthen the Republican Party Quayle In fact the group has only one real purpose to raise funds and promote the RPH before official campaigning as well as official fund raising begins in 1999 What does the RPH believe in Well the RPH has Principles The RPH is high minded He frequently quotes Ronald Reagan He especially enjoys taking a bold public stand against his party This distinguishes him as a statesman who won t sacrifice principles for expediency It also guarantees a bit of favorable press Ashcroft regularly berates the Republican Congress for having cut and run rather than having tackled tough moral issues Forbes periodically slaps Republicans in Congress for compromising Get real or get out is a Forbes slogan Keyes makes a habit of denouncing the GOP for expanding government for approving treaties for not impeaching Clinton etc And the RPH often slams fellow Republicans for not doing enough to ban abortion The RPH who must legislate or govern Gingrich Kasich Bush is quieter about his principles probably because he actually has to live by them There is no such check on the unemployed RPH The RPH has a multipoint tax plan usually at least four points often 10 The RPH generally believes in the flat tax which should be set at 17 percent Quayle that tax and spend liberal would set it at a whopping 19 percent The RPH might also believe in eliminating the income tax Keyes slashing the income tax and raising tariffs Buchanan or rejiggering the tax code to save taxpayers 985 billion Ashcroft by abolishing taxes on inheritances and on Social Security benefits among other measures The RPH does not much elaborate on how he would balance the budget after his cuts The RPH is a writer The RPH has hidden literary talents You can t turn around in a bookstore without knocking over a pile of unsold RPH books Click for a list of them and another mix and match game The publication of the RPH book is followed by the book tour which leads to the next fact about the RPH The RPH likes to travel to New Hampshire and Iowa Gingrich recently toured to promote Lessons Learned the Hard Way He found himself signing books in Manchester N H and Des Moines Iowa undoubtedly because those cities are famed for their interest in great literature Forbes Alexander Ashcroft Kasich and John McCain have also recently visited New Hampshire Forbes Alexander Ashcroft Smith and Keyes have stopped off in Iowa Kemp has traveled to Iowa at least seven times And the pressing business of New York took Pataki on a 12 city tour through the South and the West The RPH will also travel to any place where a few dozen Republicans have gathered Last summer the Midwestern Republican Leadership Conference in Indianapolis drew eight RPHs A similar meeting in Biloxi Miss this year also attracted eight hopefuls Even the recent summit of the Harris County Texas Republicans managed to pull in Quayle Forbes Keating Ashcroft and Bauer If you held a family reunion you could probably get Ashcroft Keyes and Forbes to give stump speeches at the barbecue The RPH trolls for endorsements The RPH knows he needs support from the opinion making class to win in 2000 The RPH has almost certainly appeared on Evans Novak If he s lucky the RPH has been championed by a pundit Cal Thomas just wrote a paean to Quayle Kasich won a full throated cheer from the New York Times Magazine There is one endorsement the RPH seeks above all Ralph Reed s The RPH longs to sign the former Christian Coalition boss as a campaign consultant Quayle Kemp Forbes Alexander Bush Kasich and Ashcroft have already met with Reed and kissed his ring Perhaps the most important and certainly most ridiculous element of the pre campaign is the early polls Never has so much been made of such flimsy numbers Ashcroft got a media boost when he finished first in a survey of Christian Coalition state chapter leaders Forbes fans tout his top finish in a straw poll of Conservative Political Action Conference members There have been national news stories based on straw polls of a few hundred party loyalists in Mississippi Texas and the Midwest Recently a 234 person phone poll by a New Hampshire TV station made headlines There is a discouraging lesson in the polls for the RPH Bush has finished first easily in every poll except the Christian Coalition s and CPAC s He is also one of the few RPHs who eschews the pre campaign He s running for re election as governor this fall and he doesn t want Texans to worry that he ll skip out on them midway through his second term which of course is exactly what he d like to do So Bush has no PAC and no book He hasn t traveled to Iowa or New Hampshire and he avoids most GOP conferences Instead he s just governing and campaigning in Texas This should frighten the daylights out of the RPH Perhaps all the scheming posturing speechifying and money grubbing in the world can t help the RPH Perhaps Republican voters really want to reward the doer not the campaigner not the pre campaigner If
