CIA memoranda of information from a foreign government report that the chief of Iraq s intelligence service and a military expert in bomb making met with Bin Ladin at his farm outside Khartoum on July 30 1996 The source claimed that Bin Ladin asked for and received assistance from the bomb making expert who remained there giving training until September 1996 which is when the information was passed to the United States See Intelligence reports made available to the Commission The information is puzzling since Bin Ladin left Sudan for Afghanistan in May 1996 and there is no evidence he ventured back there or anywhere else for a visit In examining the source material the reports note that the information was received third hand passed from the foreign government service that does not meet directly with the ultimate source of the information but obtains the information from him through two unidentified intermediaries one of whom merely delivers the information to the Service The same source claims that the bomb making expert had been seen in the area of Bin Ladin s Sudan farm in December 1995 56 Intelligence report Possible Islamic Army Foreknowledge of an Egyptian Operation and

with criminal prosecutors or FBI agents investigating criminal matters without first obtaining OIPR s permission These caveats were initially created at the direction of Attorney General Reno and applied solely to reports of information gathered from three specific surveillances she had authorized Because NSA decided it was administratively too difficult to determine whether particular reports derived from the specific surveillances authorized by the attorney general NSA decided to place this caveat on all its terrorism related reports In November 2000 in response to direction from the FISA

4 2003 On the indictment issue and the supposed Sudanese offer to give up Bin Ladin see Samuel Berger interview Jan 14 2004 In early May 1996 the CIA received intelligence that Bin Ladin might be leaving Sudan Though this reporting was described as very spotty it would have been passed along to the DCI s office because of high concern about Bin Ladin at the time But it did not lead to plans for a U S operation to snatch Bin Ladin because there was no indictment against him Ron interview Mar 18 2004 Frank interview Mar 18 2004 It appears however that if another country had been willing to imprison Bin Ladin the CIA might have tried to work out a scenario for apprehending him CIA cable May 8 1996 The Sudanese government did not notify the United States that Bin Ladin had left the country until about two days after his departure DOS cable Nairobi 07020 Sudan Foreign Minister on Developments May 21 1996 President Clinton in a February 2002 speech to the Long Island Association said that the United States did not accept a Sudanese offer and take Bin Ladin because there was no indictment President Clinton speech to the Long Island Association Feb 15 2002 videotape of speech But the President told us that he had misspoken and was wrongly recounting a number of press stories he had read After reviewing this matter in preparation for his Commission meeting President Clinton told us that Sudan never offered to turn Bin Ladin over to the United States President Clinton meeting Apr 8 2004 Berger told us that he saw no chance that Sudan would have handed Bin Ladin over and also noted that in 1996 the U S government still did not know of any al Qaeda attacks on U S citizens Samuel Berger interview Jan 14 2004 Alleged Sudanese offers to cooperate on counterterrorism have been the subject of much recent controversy After repeatedly demanding that Sudan stop supporting terrorist groups in 1993 the U S government designated the country a state sponsor of terrorism Diplomatic discussions continued but had little impact on Sudanese support for terrorism or on other issues such as human rights In the fall of 1995 the United States conducted a Sudan policy review and supported by a vocal segment of Congress the White House sought to pressure and isolate the Sudanese Susan Rice interview Jan 9 2004 After Bin Ladin left Sudan in May 1996 some State Department officials including Ambassador Carney criticized the NSC s hard line policy which he felt provided no carrots for Sudanese moderates to cooperate on counterterrorism He also faulted the NSC for not reopening the U S embassy in Khartoum closed in early 1996 when security concerns there were reevaluated State s Sudan desk officer agreed noting that the embassy was an excellent vehicle for gathering information on terrorists According to one State official NSC policymakers views were too firmly set to engage and test the Sudanese on counterterrorism Timothy Carney interview Dec 4 2003 David Shinn interview Aug 29 2003 Stephen Schwartz interview Dec 30 2003 But supporters of the tough line such as the NSC s Susan Rice argued that any conciliatory statements from Khartoum belied its unhelpful actions For example she noted though Sudan did eventually expel Bin Ladin his al Qaeda network retained a presence in the country Susan Rice interview Jan 9 2004 In addition the CIA s Africa Division whose operatives had engaged the Sudanese on counterterrorism in early 1996 would conclude that there is no indication that Sudanese involvement with terrorism has decreased in the past year They saw the Sudanese gestures toward cooperating as tactical retreats aimed at deceiving Washington in hopes of having sanctions removed CIA memo Walter to Acting DCI Africa Division s Recommendations Regarding Sudan Dec 17 1996 The CIA official who ran the Sudanese portfolio and met with the Sudanese on numerous occasions told us the Sudanese were not going to deliver and the perceived moderates were just flat out lying Mark interview May 12 2004 In February 1997 the Sudanese sent letters to President Clinton and Secretary of State Albright extending an invitation for a U S counterterrorism inspection mission to visit Sudan The Sudanese also used private U S citizens to pass along offers to cooperate Mansoor Ijaz interview May 7 2004 Janet McElligot interview Oct 20 2003 But these offers were dismissed because the NSC viewed Sudan as all talk and little action U S officials also feared that the Sudanese would exploit any positive American responses including trips to the region by U S officials for their own political purposes See Joint Inquiry interview of David Williams June 26 2002 Today Sudan is still listed as a state sponsor of terrorism 8 Mike
