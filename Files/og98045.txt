ENTITLED NATIONAL EMISSION STANDARDS FOR HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANTS FOR SOURCE CATEGORY PULP AND PAPER PRODUCTION EFFLUENT LIMITATIONS GUIDELINES PRETREATMENT STANDARDS AND NEW SOURCE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS PULP PAPER AND PAPERBOARD CATEGORY RIN 2040 AB53 i Cost benefit analysis EPA performed an Economic Analysis of the final rule including the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act portions of the rule and the analysis is summarized in the preamble to the final rule Our Office received a copy of the entire analysis as required by the Congressional Review Act The analysis shows that the combined costs of the air and water portions of the rule to be a capital cost of 1 393 billion with operating and maintenance costs of 211 million and post and pre tax annualized costs of 229 million and 351 million respectively While the analysis states that EPA is confident of the cost figures included in the analysis an estimation of the benefits is more difficult because of EPA s inability to quantitatively evaluate all human and ecosystem benefits and to assign monetary values to these benefits for a comparison in a standard cost benefit framework For example EPA was only able to monetize three of the seven air pollutants affected by the rule The analysis also discusses in qualitative terms the benefits of the rule regarding human health including the health effects for Native American subsistence fishermen and reduction of projected non cancer effects and improvements in fish and wildlife habitat ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 EPA has certified that the final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because using the size standard of fewer than 750 employees only four firms would be considered small entities The cost of the Clean Water Act portion of the rule for these entities only exceeded 1 percent of revenues for one of the facilities and in no case did it exceed 3 percent EPA GAO OGC 98 45 estimates that the impact of the Clean Air Act maximum achievable control technology portion of the rule in combination with the Clean Water Act portion is that one facility owned by one of the four small entities may close as a result of the combined impact iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C 1532 1535 EPA has determined that the final rule while not imposing a federal mandate that will result in the expenditure of 100 million or more in any one year will impose such a mandate on the private sector Therefore in compliance with section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act EPA prepared a written statement including a cost benefit analysis assessing the impact of the rule which is summarized in the preamble to the final rule A complete copy of the statement was furnished to our Office as part of the Economic Analysis While EPA determined that the rule will not significantly or uniquely affect any state local or tribal governments EPA consulted with state and local air and water pollution control officials primarily regarding implementation issues Section 205 of the Act requires agencies to identify and consider a reasonable number of regulatory alternatives and to adopt the least costly most cost effective or least burdensome alternative that achieves the objectives of the rule The preamble discusses the alternatives considered and why EPA believes that the alternative selected is the least costly and least burdensome consistent with the requirements of the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act iv Other relevant information or requirements under acts and executive orders Administrative Procedure Act 5 U S C 551 et seq The final rule was issued pursuant to the notice and comment procedures contained in 5 U S C 553 On December 17 1993 EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking on the integrated air and water rules in the Federal Register 58 Fed Reg 66078 On February 10 1994 EPA held a public hearing so interested parties could present their views on the proposed rule On March 8 1996 a notice of proposed rulemaking was published concerning the air portions of the rule All during this process EPA issued many notices of data availability and held other meetings with numerous industry stakeholders trade associations environmental groups states and other interested parties In the preamble to the final rule there is extensive discussion of the comments submitted and the actions and changes to the proposed rule that EPA made as a result of its consideration of the comments Page 2 GAO OGC 98 45 Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U S C 3501 3520 The final rule contains collections of information which are subject to approval by the Office of Management and Budget OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act The preamble to the final rule contains the required information regarding the collections including the legal basis and reason for the collections the number of respondents and an estimate of the annual burden hours EPA estimates that there are approximately 490 respondents that are affected by the air emission rules and must submit an initial applicability notification Of these 490 respondents an estimated 155 respondents would be required to perform additional information collection This results in an estimated burden of 320 hours over the first 3 years after promulgation at a 3 year cost of 29 600 per respondent The collections have been sent to OMB for approval and the requirement is not effective until approved by OMB and a control number is issued Statutory authorization for the rule The final rule was issued pursuant to the authority of sections 301 304 306 307 308 402 and 501 of the Clean Water Act 33 U S C 1311 1314 1316 1317 1318 1342 and 1361 and sections 112 114 and 301 of the Clean Air Act 42 U S C 7412 7414 and 7601 Executive Order No 12866 The final rule was determined to be an economically significant regulatory action by the Office of Management and Budget It was reviewed by OMB and approved as meeting the requirements of the Order Page 3 GAO OGC 98 45
