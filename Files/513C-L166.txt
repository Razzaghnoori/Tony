 November 15 1990 Name Address City ST Zip Dear Dr Name Dentistry has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember My sister is a practicing hygienist my brother a certified dental technician and my father has been both a general practitioner and dental educator It was all of those positive influences that I have to thank for opening my eyes to dentistry as a profession Being a third year student and having just escaped crown and bridge lab and the rest of the second year in one exhausted piece I have just now begun to put two years of learning into daily clinical practice It has become obvious to me already how crucial the latest techniques and materials are to all fields of dentistry Not only are the latest and best techniques important to delivering quality dental care they also help to preserve the traditional quality of dental education offered by IU Unfortunately these improvements are costly so additional funds are necessary I m sure that stepping into private practice for the first time will be intimidating enough but doing so without the best training possible would be twice as stressful That is why it is essential to the students at IUSD that you continue your annual gift of 500 or more as a Century II Fellow Support at this level is assisting the dental school in a variety of ways We look forward to your renewal as a Century II Fellow On behalf of all IUSD students I would like to personally thank you for your past support of dental education As I have learned from the three members of my family who have already earned degrees from the School of Dentistry the quality of my education will have a direct bearing on my professional life for years to come Thank you for helping make my education in dentistry an excellent one Sincerely Steven Schimmele Vice President Class of 1992 P S Please send any survival tips for third and fourth year dental students to me in care of IUSD
