 Lolita Revisited Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Dear Prudie I had an experience recently that I m not sure how to deal with A friend of my daughter s was at our house and I gave her a ride home During the trip she was asking me a lot of sex questions such as Do you think it s OK to have sex with an older man and Is it normal to play with yourself The looks she was giving me suggested she was talking about me and her She is only 15 but the body is quite mature When we got to her house she hugged me and gave me a kiss tongue and all Now I can t get her out of my mind I m sure she wants to have sex with me C D Dear C A few words come to my mind Lolita and jail If this happened as you say the kid is big trouble and wildly precocious Or maybe she saw American Beauty too many times To protect yourself in all ways do not allow any situation to occur where you are alone with that girl As for getting her out of your mind do understand that your daughter s friend s plans for you make you the next thing to a science experiment You would be a notch on her belt and perhaps a candidate for her father to make your life a living hell Prudie suggests you not feel flattered by this proposition and get a grip Quick Prudie sputteringly Dear Prudence I feel a little odd asking for help with this but you seem to have the savvy to get me through this awkward situation It stands thus I am engaged to be married next year to a wonderful young man We re both thrilled our parents are happy and our mutual friends haven t quit telling us that they told us so This seems like all is well The problem though is bridesmaids I want to have a fairly simple wedding but there are two people I can t imagine getting married without not counting the groom One of them is my oldest friend who is now going to college several states away I have always promised her she would be in my wedding The other one is my closest friend in college who has been there with me through the last four tough years They re both excited about it the thing is I don t know how I can pick one or the other as maid of honor Is there any way I can split the title What can I do Crossing My Fingers for an Answer Dear Cross You can do what some corporations do They have co presidents and you can have co maids of honor The distinction between a maid or matron of honor and bridesmaids is usually a different bouquet and walking down the aisle first Simply have their bouquets be identical and perhaps have them walk together And in conversation refer to them as co maids of honor Now wasn t that simple And Prudie wishes you mazel ton which of course is tons of luck Prudie ceremonially Prudie My boyfriend and I plan to marry next year However we have realized we can t possibly receive any gifts simply because our tiny apartment is just barely big enough for the two of us Anyhow I don t know how to say No gifts on the invite because presumably people would ignore it So is it appropriate to ask for say money instead Help Cramped Dear Cramp No it is not appropriate to have the invitations say No gifts just money please due to space Prudie will give you the secret however for turning gifts into money Take the goodies back for a store credit cash refunds being most unusual At some point you can select something you will have room for Or you can use the credit to buy a gift for someone when the occasion demands it Or you can sell the store credit at a small discount of course to a friend who you know is in need of purchasing whatever And mazel ton to you as well Prudie practically Dear Prudence I work for a small family owned company Two of the family members frequently shout and swear at each other Even though their abuse is never directed at me a non family member I feel uncomfortable listening to this and am ready to start job hunting Do you have any suggestions on how to handle the shouting Do I ignore them Shout back Thanks Peace Lover Dear Peace It is not a good idea to shout at one s employer In the situation you describe that privilege apparently comes with the blood relationship This is not an unheard of phenomenon by the way with certain volatile personalities who work together It is always a strain on bystanders of course but often the underlying relationships of the shouters can be essentially friendly It is too bad when the lack of control and decorum in a place of business encourages job hunting If Prudie thought it would be useful she would recommend that you tell the yelling duo that their form of communication is disturbing the rest of the office but she intuits that the hotheads are in the habit and will not change If your job hunt is unproductive try earplugs Prudie pragmatically
