        hi   so what well what do you think   well providing universal health care insurance for the whole country is a pretty big task and i uh personally i dont approve of it for two reasons number one is that i think that uh the federal government has a problem with the deficit right now and if they were to administer this they would uh get us more and more into debt further than we can ever get out ourselves number two i think that the quality of health care would go down because the competition would would be dried up and really no one would be would only answer to to the government to a big bureaucratic bureaucratic mess and uh ive seen what it has done in other countries and so i dont think uh i dont think we should head in that direction although that we have problems right now and i do agree that they exist because health care insurance for for everyone is skyrocketing and its become to a point where basically no one can afford it anymore   umhum   how do you feel about the whole whole ordeal   well i agree that its a big task but i think that i think that the US should move towards some kind of national health care plan at least as a long term kind of goal   umhum   you know possibly you know just starting with more regulation of health insurance and that sort of thing but i think that ultimately it would be a good idea to um and not have a completely socialized       medical system in the country but maybe something about halfway between that and what we have now   uhhuh okay   it um just because it seems that um health insurance costs are sky rocketing well as fast as the national deficit   oh yes   perhaps and so thats and thats a thats a vicious cycle of course   but what what youre think yeah so what youre saying though is instead of having the national government government administer   because   giving health insurance to every man woman and child with throughout the whole company you see more of them as regulating the high costs uh that people are forced to pay for it right now is that is that correct or do you think that   um well i um well i wouldnt exclude the possibility of the government actually administrating it ultimately i dont think that that would necessarily be such a bad idea and um   well with the with the costs as they are right now do you think that the government uh because what that would require is for us to pay uh more taxes and the the income the people that can afford taxes the middle income and the upper income will be paying more cash taxes to to pay for health insurance for everyone whereas right now the the public themselves   right   get health insurance and they provide their own health insurance   the well as it is now the middle and upper classes are paying more than their share for the health care of the whole country because theyre the only people that can afford health insurance and so that the other people have no health insurance and you know theyll get medical care anyway at least in emergencies       and somebody winds up paying for that and basically the people paying for it are the people who are buying health insurance so i do not see that anything this situation would get any worse that way it might get better   you think it might be get better huh i i kind of disagree  the reason being is uh   umhum   we have i dont know i guess its my my fear of the national government and also because the bureaucratic   umhum   rules that it would take to administer it and um the the health insurance companies right now pretty much regulate and are pretty picky and and uh dont allow cases where they might throw them out of business whereas the federal government if they took over everything they wouldnt care because theyll never go out of business people would still have to pay taxes the money would have to come from somewhere and so youd see i i feel that the cost would increase dramatically also but in the same sense the the care and the the attitude of the doctors and the professionals within the medical uh field would would diminish   umhum   um i   yeah well i think
