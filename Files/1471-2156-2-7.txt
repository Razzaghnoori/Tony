 Introduction The Pima Indians have a very high prevalence for type 2 diabetes mellitus or non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus NIDDM with evidence of strong familial aggregation 1 In this population insulin resistance is a major risk factor for the development of the disease 2 and maximal insulin action i e glucose disposal rate at pharmacological insulin levels was found to be determined by a co dominantly inherited autosomal gene 3 Initially Bogardus and colleagues observed an association and linkage between insulin resistance and red cell antigens on chromosome 4q 4 After the analysis of 128 sib pairs using quantitative trait sib pair analysis they observed a significant linkage between maximal insulin action and the intestinal fatty acid binding protein 2 FABP2 gene and the annexin V ANX5 gene on chromosome 4q 5 It is well recognized that fatty acid metabolism is linked to insulin resistance 6 7 Intestinal FABP2 contains a single ligand binding site that displays a high affinity for fatty acid 8 Because it is a candidate gene at this locus a search for a mutation was initiated and an Alanine GCT to Threonine ACT polymorphism at codon 54 was identified in Pima Indians 9 The associations between this polymorphism and fasting insulin concentration fasting fat oxidation and glucose uptake during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp were identified in 137 non diabetic Pima Indians 9 Because NIDDM is a genetic disorder 10 and results from an imbalance between insulin sensitivity and beta cell function we hypothesized that the A54T polymorphism of the FABP2 gene plays a role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance which is one of the key determinants for the development of NIDDM 2 Since insulin sensitivity is affected by hypertension 11 12 and abnormal glucose tolerance 2 we examined the relationship of this polymorphism with insulin sensitivity in 55 healthy and normotensive Caucasians with normal glucose tolerance Results The clinical features of the studied subjects were shown in Table 1 Using the PCR RFLP assay we identified 24 AA 27 AT and 4 TT subjects In this Caucasian population the allele frequency was 68 for the A allele and 32 for the T allele The distribution of genotypes was in compliance with the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium p 0 8321 Since there were only 4 TT subjects they were pooled with the AT subjects during the analysis There were no differences in clinical features between the two genotypic groups AA vs AT TT as shown in Table 2 Although the AT TT subjects had a higher fasting plasma insulin concentration than the AA subjects p 0 0444 no differences were noted in fasting plasma glucose concentrations and postchallenged plasma glucose and insulin concentrations We estimated insulin sensitivity S and beta cell function B using the average of the three fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations While no difference was noted in B the AT TT subjects were more insulin resistant a lower S than the AA subjects p 0 0461 Since a higher body mass index had been reported to be associated with this polymorphism 13 we were concerned that the observed differences could be the result of other confounding covariates A multivariate analysis was performed to examine the influence of this polymorphism and other covariates Table 3 This polymorphism and body mass index explained 28 7 of the variation in S and this polymorphism was an independent determinant of S p 0 0434 However this polymorphism had no impact on B Age gender and waist hip ratio accounted for 19 5 of the variation in B Discussions In this study we found that the A54T polymorphism of the FABP2 was associated with insulin resistance and accounted for 7 3 of the variation in S Multivariate analysis confirmed that this polymorphism was an independent risk factor for insulin resistance In contrast this polymorphism had no impact on B Our observations confirm that the A54T polymorphism of the FABP2 affects insulin sensitivity which was previously reported in Pima Indian and Japanese populations 9 14 The FABP2 locus has been studied extensively MNS red cell antigens one of the few genetic markers available at that time were initially found to be linked to insulin resistance in 86 non diabetic Pima Indians from 31 nuclear families using a sib pair analysis and they were also associated with insulin resistance in 132 non diabetic Pima Indians 4 With additional families and additional genetic markers a significant linkage was identified between the FABP2 and ANX5 loci on chromosome 4q with insulin resistance in 123 non diabetic subjects from 46 nuclear families 5 Furthermore the linkage of the FABP2 locus with insulin resistance 2 hour postchallenged insulin concentration was also found in a Mexican American population which is genetically related to the Pima Indians 15 However sib pair analysis failed to detect any linkage of the FABP2 locus or the A54T polymorphism with diabetes related phenotypes in other ethnic groups 16 17 as shown in Table 4A Furthermore no linkage was found between the FABP2 locus Table 4B and diabetes 18 19 lipodystrophic diabetes 20 or obesity 17 As shown in Table 4C the population association studies of the FABP2 locus with diabetes impaired glucose tolerance were negative in UK Finnish and Welsh 21 and Japanese populations 22 Subsequently the A54T polymorphism was identified and was found to be associated with increased fatty acid binding protein increased fat oxidation and increased insulin resistance in the Pima Indians 9 The population association studies of the A54T polymorphism with NIDDM 9 23 24 25 coronary artery disease 26 27 obesity 24 and hypertension 24 were also essentially negative Positive associations were mostly observed in quantitative association studies as shown in Table 4D In addition to the original positive association between the A54T polymorphism and fasting plasma insulin concentration fasting fat oxidation and glucose uptake in non diabetic Pima Indians 9 positive association was also found with obesity 13 14 2 hour post challenged insulin concentration 14 and various lipid metabolism 13 28 29 30 In the present study we also demonstrated a positive quantitative association between this polymorphism and S However numerous negative studies were also noted 23 24 29 31 32 33 Clearly there is substantial controversy surrounding this locus and the A54T polymorphism in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and T2DM as described above Disagreement also occurred in the original Pima Indian study Although significant linkages were identified at the FABP2 locus with fasting insulin concentration p 0 0004 and with glucose uptake p 0 0008 in the Pima Indians 5 the differences regarding the A54T polymorphism with fasting insulin concentrations p 0 04 and glucose uptake p 0 04 were only marginally significant in the same population 9 The significant linkage in the original sib pair study 5 could be the combined results of a highly polymorphic marker of the FABP2 locus 5 alleles vs 2 alleles for the A54T polymorphism and less intrafamilial difference in insulin sensitivity as the result of familial clustering of insulin sensitivity In contrast the marginal difference reflected a very modest influence on insulin sensitivity of the A54T polymorphism in the Pima Indian population which is consistent with our observation that this polymorphism only accounted for 7 3 of the variation in S in this Caucasian population Furthermore since 1 insulin resistance is neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of T2DM 2 this polymorphism has only a very modest influence on insulin sensitivity and 3 beta cell dysfunction on which this polymorphism has no influence in the present study plays a key role in the development of overt diabetes 2 the population association studies and linkage studies are not able to detect the interaction between this polymorphism and the diabetes phenotype In contrast quantitative studies of diabetes related phenotypes become more rewarding in detecting a polymorphism of a very modest effect as shown in Table 4D The negative quantitative studies could be the result of other confounding factors such as the inclusion of diabetic impaired glucose tolerant or hypertensive subjects in the study Therefore we only enrolled glucose tolerant and normotensive subjects in the present study for the reasons described previously The most convincing evidence that supports the A54T polymorphism as a causal mutation is from a functional study of mutated FABP2 9 FABP2 plays a role in the absorption and intracellular transportation of dietary long chain fatty acids 8 Thr54 containing FABP2 has a twofold greater affinity for long chain fatty acids than the Ala54 containing FABP2 9 As predicted by the proposed 6 7 and subsequently proven 34 Randle s cycle an increased concentration of fatty acid inhibits glucose uptake in muscle and results in insulin resistance Furthermore two interventional studies showed that this A54T polymorphism affected lipid metabolism during interventions 35 36 as shown in Table 4E In summary we examined the role of the A54T polymorphism in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in 55 glucose tolerant and normotensive healthy Caucasians We found that this polymorphism had an independent but very modest influence 7 3 on insulin sensitivity S which was assessed by the HOMA However it had no impact on beta cell function B To our knowledge this is the very first report of a positive association between this polymorphism and insulin sensitivity in a Caucasian population Subjects and Methods Subjects Through the advertisement in the campus newspaper of this institution healthy subjects without a prior history of diabetes and hypertension were invited to participate in the study None of the participants were receiving medical treatment on a regular basis Subjects were instructed to fast for at least 14 hours before the study visit On the morning of the visit subjects were admitted to the General Clinical Research Center of this institution as outpatients An indwelling angiocatheter was inserted into an antecubital vein All subjects had fasting blood samples drawn at 15 10 and 5 minutes A blood sample for the fasting lipid profile was obtained at 15 minutes Fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were calculated as the average of the three fasting samples After an oral administration of 75 gm glucose postchallenged blood samples were drawn at 30 60 90 and 120 minutes for glucose and insulin measurements A total of 55 Caucasian subjects were enrolled in the study They were glucose tolerant fasting plasma glucose 6 1 mM interval plasma glucose 11 1 mM and 2 hour plasma glucose 7 8 mM and normotensive systolic blood pressure 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were assayed as described previously 37 Insulin sensitivity S and beta cell function B were estimated based on the Homeostasis Model Assessment HOMA as described elsewhere 38 39 They were calculated from the average of three fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations mM and mU L respectively using the following formulae S 22 5 insulin x glucose and B 20 x insulin glucose 3 5 The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and written informed consents were obtained at the entry of the study from each participant We confirm that the study has complied with the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki Genotyping Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes using the method described previously 40 A polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR RFLP assay was developed for genotyping The genomic DNA fragment flanking the A54T polymorphism was amplified using two primers flanking exon 2 of the FABP2 gene CTACCGAGTTTTCTTCCCACC and AATTAAACCATCCAATGAAATAGAGC Polymerase chain reaction PCR was carried out in an 11 l reaction volume containing 0 5 pM of each primer 0 2 mM dNTP 2 mM MgCl 2 5 glycerol 0 275 U Taq polymerase 50 mM KC1 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8 3 and 0 1 g of genomic DNA The region of interest was amplified by an initial denaturation at 94 C for 5 minutes 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 C for 30 seconds annealing at 60 C for 30 seconds and extension at 72 C for 30 seconds and concluded with a final extension at 72 C for 10 minutes Then 5 l of the PCR product 375 base pairs was digested in a 15 l reaction volume containing 1 U of Hha I New England Biolabs Inc Beverly Massachusetts USA with the buffer supplied by the vender The digested PCR products were resolved on 2 0 agarose gels Hha I digested the wild type Alanine GCT which yielded two products 200 and 175 base pairs A allele The G to A substitution Threonine ACT destroyed the Hha I site T allele Statistical analysis Variables which failed the Normality test were logarithmically transformed before analysis They were age body mass index waist hip ratio plasma insulin concentrations S and B The relationship between the variables and parameters of interest B or S was determined by using univariate analysis A multivariate analysis using a stepwise regression strategy was employed to examine the effect of covariates on the parameter of interest S and B The continuous covariates were age body mass index waist hip ratio and systolic and diastolic blood pressure The categorical covariates were gender and the FABP2 polymorphism Backward stepwise option with alpha to enter of 0 10 and alpha to remove of 0 10 was employed to exclude covariates that had much less or no influence on the parameter under analysis one at a time starting from the one had least impact which was based on the p value the highest p value Stepwise regression analysis was stopped when all the p values of all covariates that were examined were less than 0 10 Since a very close linear relationship was noted between systolic and diastolic pressure r 2 0 3586 p 0 0001 and also between body mass index and waist hip ratio r 2 0 3014 p 0 0001 they were removed from the multivariate analysis based on their p values as indicated in each analysis A nominal P value of less than 0 05 was considered significant SYSTAT 8 0 for Windows from SPSS Inc Chicago Illinois was used for the statistical analysis
